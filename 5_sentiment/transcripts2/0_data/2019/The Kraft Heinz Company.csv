With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with the scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where we did not and why. 
At this time last year, we set plans to drive profitable sales and consumption growth by investing in deployment of new capabilities and a strong pipeline of innovation and white space initiatives. And while we expected this to translate into near-term margin pressure in United States and Rest of the World segments, we anticipated stronger net savings to deliver constant currency EBITDA growth for the year. Overall, we successfully drove profitable sales and consumption growth accelerated, but we fell short in delivering the net savings we expect.
From a commercial perspective, we firmly restarted organic growth. In United States, our second half performance came back to offset the self-inflicted losses from the first half of the year. We became one of the few within our industry posting real volume-driven growth, growing volume/mix nearly 4%.
In Canada, similar to United States, we ended the year with positive consumption growth from improvements in coffee and cheese. Our EMEA business build momentum on the back of white space gains in condiments and encouraging share trends across our U.K. base. In Rest of the World, we are gaining traction in driving real growth with the startup of a new plant in Brazil and our Cerebos acquisition in Australia and New Zealand.
In our Foodservice business, on a global basis, is approaching $4 billion in sales and gaining momentum from white space initiatives in all markets. And this leads to the second aspect of our scorecard, the significant progress we made developing and deploying strategically a [indiscernible] capability. We have strong returns on investment in marketing, category management and e-store sales. We continue to expand in e-commerce and reach, driving 79% channel growth in United States alone and a [ onetime ] market share index versus traditional retail. In this setup, springboard and evolves [indiscernible] platforms to accelerate our innovation to consumers, to customers and find new ways to disrupt ourselves.
So when you think about the sustainability of our growth, breakthrough innovation, strong in-store activity, distribution gain and white space expansion are all coming together. In fact, our consumption turnaround in the United States had been driven by brand-building initiatives across the portfolio, not just a few categories. We are sustaining momentum in brands have been successful like Heinz, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer bacon, Classico, and our frozen and snack category at large, all growing mid-single digits in 2018.
Turning around other brands like Kraft mac & cheese, Oscar Mayer hot dogs and [indiscernible] to low single-digit growth after several years of decline. Stabilizing historically challenged brands like Kraft salad dressing, mayo and our kids single-serve beverage business after years of mid-single-digit declines.
In building new brands into meaningful platforms of growth like [indiscernible] which now $120 million platform; Devour, a $7 million brand in less than 3 years and Just Crack an Egg at $50 million after only 12 months. While some of this was supported by incremental promotion and price investments to improve consumption and distribution trends, we saw strong LOIs and created a solid base of support and commercial momentum for 2019. 
Where we fell short in [ 2019 ] was operations. Specifically, our entire EBITDA miss was driven by net savings versus expectations within our United States supply chain. To be fair, we must first recognize it's our team operate at industry-leading levels globally; in quality, with top-tier performance in the industry; in safety, with our best results ever; and in customer service, achieving industry-leading case through rates and all time [indiscernible] delivery rates as we saw volumes ramp up. 
The core cause of our shortfall in 2018 was forecasting the pace and magnitude of our savings curve in 2018, not merger-related synergies and not an increase in costs. In fact, delivered savings across all of fixed-cost package outside of our commercial investments and helped to fund our initiative.
To put our performance in context, we started 2018 expecting approximately 3% growth inflation, excluding key commodity costs with savings programs expected to offset gross inflation. We ended the year with approximately 3% inflation, net of savings, specifically driven by higher supply chain costs and low operational savings in United States. There is no question we are disappointed that did not ramp up with consumption gains as anticipated. We are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end. For that, we take full responsibility. And we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by planning process, procedures and organization structure.
In the end, we see 3 key takeaways from 2018: one, we are successfully driving sustainable consumption growth; two, we have the ability to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins; and three, we need to better plan and execute our operational net savings initiatives.
Before we outline the 2019 plans, David will provide more details on our 2018 financials."

As we show on Slide 3, while our overall performance fell short of our expectations, the year-on-year drivers are straightforward. Consumption-driven growth, negatively impacted by cost inflation, net of savings in the U.S. with tax savings offsetting lower EBITDA, higher depreciation and interest expense.
From a trend perspective, there are a few important details to highlight. On the top line, consumption-driven growth momentum continued to build through Q4. For total Kraft Heinz, Q4 volume/mix growth was 4% with growth in every reporting segment, driven by innovation, marketing, white space and go-to-market investments and led by improved consumption in a vast majority of U.S. categories. 
Total company Q4 pricing was down 160 basis points, including 80 basis points from key commodity pass-through in the U.S. Also note that the sequential decline in pricing versus Q3 was accentuated by a deceleration in contribution from price in our Rest of World Segment.
And regarding U.S. pricing trends, as Bernardo mentioned, we were happy with the returns and results on this front. To provide more context and adjust for program timing, it's useful to understand the key drivers of U.S. pricing from a second half perspective. U.S. pricing in the second half of 2018 was down 2.4 percentage points, with 1 point from passing through lower key commodity costs. So U.S. pricing, net of key commodity impacts, was down 1.4% in the second half. Out of this, 40 basis points of the decline was primarily related to [ descending ] our natural cheese business by closing freight debts to private label. The remaining 1 point was a combination of opportunistic price investments in support of our innovation pipeline to stimulate incremental consumption with good lift and solid returns. Looking forward and excluding the impact of key commodity pass-through, we do not expect pricing to be down in 2019, either in the U.S. or globally.
Moving to EBITDA. We said on our last call that we expected our EBITDA growth rate to improve beginning in Q4. While this turned out directionally accurate, Q4 constant currency adjusted EBITDA was significantly below the expectations we previously outlined. As Bernardo mentioned, this was driven by shortfalls in the United States. To be more specific, while the one-off factors we outlined in Q3, by and large, fell away as expected, anticipated savings did not materialize, particularly in our procurement area and, to a lesser extent, we had higher-than-anticipated costs in both manufacturing and logistics.
Taken together, top line trends and bottom line results lead us to the key factors we considered over the past few months in finalizing our 2019 plans outlined on Slide 4, and I'll hand it back to Bernardo to start it off."

Our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged on [indiscernible] continued fragmentation of consumer demand, a general lack of affordability to reinvesting brands, retail competition where assortment is likely to grow in importance and finally, in the short term, ongoing cost inflation. 
[indiscernible] savings shortfall and the Heinz we're seeing. We focus on maintain or expanding margins but [indiscernible] commercial growth and market share. By [indiscernible] pace of innovation and channel development, focusing on marketing efficiency versus incremental marketing presence and compromising talent development at a critical time. We have not and we will not.
We are choosing to focus on improving our long-term growth trajectory and returns by: driving consumption in market share; leveraging next-generation capabilities for brand and categories advantage; and importantly, securing the right talent in areas critical to growth. In fact, in light of the backdrop, we have concluded that there is no better time for Kraft Heinz to improve our growth profile. 
And looking forward, we have set 3 objectives for 2019: first, leverage our industry-leading margins to sustain our commercial momentum; second, more actively manage our portfolio; and third, strengthen our balance sheet as we continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. I will cover our commercial growth initiative, and David will outline our portfolio, capital restructure and financial expectations.
By far, the biggest and the best thing you can do to build the long-term value of our portfolio is to capture sustainable commercial growth by building on the sales momentum from 2018. And we have the stronger global pipeline we ever had to go after incremental consumer demand. In the United States, we're [indiscernible] record level of innovation, improving base consumption, velocities and leveraging brands and go-to-market investments. 
In Canada, the priority is consumption in [indiscernible] as well as sauces and condiments. In Europe and Rest of the World markets, white space initiatives will focus on driving incremental sauces consumption and opening new geographies. And in foodservice, all regions have significant opportunities to gain distribution and white space.
We will support these initiatives with fully funded brand programs taking advantage of our superior [indiscernible] efficiency or cost per impression and increasing our immediate effectiveness, our sales lift per impression by deploying new creative tools in digital marketing.
In a nutshell, we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged, category managed and go-to-market initiatives to assortment and improve distribution across all channels, including e-commerce. And we plan to do this while we maintain industry-leading margins.
Now let's turn back to David as the remaining objectives are a big part of his 2019 goals."
278212,601900684,1664423,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","I'll start with our financial expectations going forward on Slide 6.

Regarding top line, we are now well positioned to continue organic net sales growth, driven by incremental consumption gains. This will reflect volume/mix growth from innovation, distribution and white space initiatives and pricing actions that balance cost inflation and our market share objectives.
On pricing, note that we exited 2018 at strong levels of merchandise and support and distribution and price gaps are currently in a better place. So we do not expect pricing to be a drag year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. In fact, our U.S. business recently announced list price increases that are scheduled to take effect late in Q1.
From an organic growth perspective, in the very near term, Q1 is likely to decline versus the prior year due to unfavorable trade timing and a shift in Easter-related shipments to Q2 this year from Q1 last year. Trade timing in Canada comparisons with a very strong winter soup season in the U.K. and destocking in Asia Pacific. For the year, we are targeting positive organic net sales growth with commercial gains partially offset by price elasticity. And on a nominal basis, a combination of currency headwinds and divestitures is likely to result in a 3 to 4 percentage point headwind to net sales.
Regarding profitability, we fully expect to maintain industry-leading margins. At the same time, we think it's prudent to begin the year by properly level-setting expectations. To do so, as a one-off for 2019, we are breaking with our established guidance practices and setting a range for expected adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for this year. This includes: commercial gains offset by stepped up support of marketing, innovation, e-commerce and people; another year of low to mid-single-digit percentage non-key commodity inflation, net of cost savings; as well as foreign exchange rates and the 2 divestitures already announced.
In addition, we currently expect to begin 2019 with the first quarter that is likely to see a high teens decline in adjusted EBITDA in percentage terms. We will be up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year, particularly in light of our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up commercial spending levels and with pricing not taking effect until late Q1.
Finally, at the EPS line, while we continue to believe that we can deliver top-tier growth, it will take hold from 2020 onwards. This is because in addition to our EBITDA outlook, 2019 will see approximately $0.25 of nonoperating headwinds versus 2018. This will come from a combination of several factors: $80 million of incremental depreciation expense; a roughly $120 million reduction in the other income line, mainly due to rising interest rates, increasing pension interest costs and less favorable market returns on planned assets assumed versus 2018; approximately $40 million of additional interest expense and a full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.
Taken together, top line, EBITDA and EPS drivers, while we expect to take a step backwards in 2019, we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards, driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands, cost structures and capabilities.
The rest of our plan is focused on how we can take additional steps to improve our portfolio's growth trajectory, strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves against inorganic opportunities. It starts with the potential for more active portfolio management, specifically through divestitures as a way to further improve our growth and returns as well as accelerate our deleveraging. 
The recent transactions we have announced [indiscernible] Beverages and Canada Natural Cheese, provide a good template of precedent for additional actions to exit areas with no clear path to competitive advantage and sell assets with strong valuations with some earnings dilution. We have now dedicated more resources, adding experience with Carlos Piani fully focused on our portfolio management efforts. And as we're able to execute such actions, we will look to deleverage with the proceeds, which leads to our next objective, further strengthening our balance sheet.
I think it's important to first recognize that we have the capacity to drive industry-leading cash generation along with industry-leading margins and expect to hold existing working capital and CapEx levels even as we drive the growth agenda we've outlined. In addition, given the industry backdrop and opportunities in front of us, we now see even greater strategic advantage in accelerating our deleveraging towards our ongoing 3x leverage target and strengthening the term structure of our debt. To do this, we're undertaking 2 specific actions: first, we intend to dedicate the divestiture proceeds from the sale of our India Beverage and Canada natural cheese businesses to debt reduction. We also intend to do the same with proceeds from additional divestitures we are currently considering.
Second, today, we're announcing a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share or $1.60 per year, down from a rate of $2.50 per year. This will not only provide us greater balance sheet flexibility, it will also establish a base dividend that we can grow consistent with EBITDA growth over time. And we are comfortable that this level of dividend can accommodate the 2 divestitures we have already announced as well as those we are currently considering. These initiatives will accelerate the strengthening of an already solid balance sheet with a fully funded pension plan and continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bernardo to close."

Beginning 2018 and into 2019, we'll focus on leveraging our industry-leading margins to establish key growth pillars through innovation and white space expansion, accelerate the global deployment of advantage capabilities across all channels and geographies and now more actively managing our portfolio for better growth and returns.

So let me step back for a second and I can break down our 2019 outlook a bit more and get a sense for our EBITDA expectations year-over-year. So overall, we expect gains from consumption growth to be in line with the stepped-up spending behind our initiatives. So really the main drivers for the expected EBITDA decline year-over-year are a few factors: first, the net inflation that we talked about that we expect to see again in 2019; the divestitures I talked about; FX and, to a lesser extent, variable compensation. So to be more specific, if you assume the midpoint of our range or roughly $700 million decline year-over-year, let me elaborate on the 4 main drivers behind that. So first off, on the commercial side, again, we should be neutral on the bottom line as we expect the positive contribution from further consumption gains to be in line with the stepped-up investments as we accelerate the pace of our innovation, base business performance and channel development; second, beyond that, roughly half of the total EBITDA decline or roughly $300 million to $400 million is driven by continued inflation, net of cost savings, in the low to mid-single-digit range, consistent with what we saw in 2018. So this will be driven by another year of mid-single-digit growth -- low to mid-single-digit growth inflation, excluding key commodities. And given the recent experience, actions we've taken to replan the savings and pushing out the savings curve. Third, we expect the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the divestitures we've already announced, that should drive another $250 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA versus 2018. And then finally, we have an impact from variable compensation, which is another roughly $80 million year-over-year. So taken together, this will put us where we saw the highest margin in the industry, and we believe that is the right base to build from. So to elaborate more on why we're confident even with the miss in expectations that we saw in Q4 and the decline in EBITDA we're seeing in 2019, let me elaborate a little bit on why we're so confident in 2020. First, on the top line, we should be very well positioned for solid organic growth globally, okay? We're already seeing real consumption-driven growth in the U.S. and globally today. So we're able to create in the second half of 2018, and in 2019, we expect to further improve our consumption rate behind the largest innovation pipeline that we've ever had and more support on the core business. And we have a rapidly growing international business with significant exposure to emerging markets and white space opportunities to accelerate that growth globally. At EBITDA, in 2019, we are spending ahead to support an even larger innovation pipeline that I mentioned and accelerating channel development, particularly in e-commerce. So the right spending in commercial support levels, capabilities and marketing will have been established this year in 2019. And then on the cost side, the extraordinary inflation that we're seeing in 2018 and that we're now seeing in 2019 from things like tariffs and transportation should mitigate over time as we're starting to see in the spot markets today. And we're also confident that we will be able to -- we'll be in a much stronger position to manage those costs through pricing in our savings curve going forward in 2020. And finally, at EPS, our nonoperating below-the-line cost that I talked about should be at run rate levels, so that we can leverage in the organic growth into both EBITDA and EPS growth 2020 going forward."

So again, let me step back for a second and kind of walk through our Q4 performance versus our original expectations to provide a little more context, and then I'll hand it over to Bernardo to provide a little more color on what we're doing differently to make sure this doesn't happen. On the Q3 call, we did expect Q4 EBITDA growth to improve sequentially, as I talked about, versus the 14% year-over-year saw in Q3, okay? And that assumption was based off of the fact that we expect the transitory headwinds and one-offs in Q3 that would fall away, which would effectively bring our run rate growth to more of a high single-digit decline year-over-year. And then on top of that, we expected savings to accelerate, leading to a significant sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, in the end, the transitory one-off factors did fall away as expected, but we have 3 negative impacts in the quarter that we didn't expect: first, we had roughly a 3.5 percentage point impact of unanticipated cost headwinds, which I can explain further; second, we did -- we didn't have the anticipated savings curve that we expected to materialize in the quarter to partially offset the inflation we're seeing; and then, finally, we did have an incremental FX drag of about 1.5 percentage points in Q4 versus Q3. So given all these factors, the year-on-year decline in Q4 is much closer than Q3 and we didn't see that sequential improvement. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to answer your other question."

And to put it into context, that compares to our overall procurement spend of over $11 billion, which excludes [ big 4 ] commodities spend.

Why we're seeing the private label expanding and it's doing so at a more -- we are seeing this happening in a more restrained pace, around 0.2 points of share in Q4. It was a material stepdown from previous quarters that we're seeing. And we are seeing most pressure in areas where low commodities, excess capacity and competition come together, mostly now in some subsegments of our cheese portfolio. Natural cheese, we see also the retailers have used price matching to drive traffic and being able to invest back, that was part of our price investment we've had in the second half to narrow the price gaps. And after that, we saw branded and private label share starting to stabilize. So again, we're always monitoring the very proposition of the market and innovate and differentiate our brands and products on that matter. When you think about 2019 pricing, we already have announced our pricing. We did an analysis in terms of to find the right part of the portfolio that we are pricing, being very cautious about the balance between sales and cost to provide the best new question and helping to drive category growth.

So because of this miss, as Bernardo said, we took significant action to address our processes, planning and structuring internally and simultaneously spent a lot of time and focus really revisiting our savings projects and we replanned.

With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where w",857,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where we did not and why. 
At this time last year, we set plans to drive profitable sales and consumption growth by investing in deployment of new capabilities and a strong pipeline of innovation and white space initiatives. And while we expected this to translate into near-term margin pressure in United States and Rest of the World segments, we anticipated stronger net savings to deliver constant currency EBITDA growth for the year. Overall, we successfully drove profitable sales and consumption growth accelerated, but we fell short in delivering the net savings we expect.
From a commercial perspective, we firmly restarted organic growth. In United States, our second half performance came back to offset the self-inflicted losses from the first half of the year. We became one of the few within our industry posting real volume-driven growth, growing volume/mix nearly 4%.
In Canada, similar to United States, we ended the year with positive consumption growth from improvements in coffee and cheese. Our EMEA business build momentum on the back of white space gains in condiments and encouraging share trends across our U.K. base. In Rest of the World, we are gaining traction in driving real growth with the startup of our new sauces plant in Brazil, and our Cerebos acquisition in Australia and New Zealand.
In our Foodservice business, on a global basis, is approaching $4 billion in sales and gaining momentum from white space initiatives in all markets. And this leads to the second aspect of our scorecard, the significant progress we made developing and deploying a strategically advanced capability. We had strong returns on investment in marketing, category management and e-store sales. We continue to expand in e-commerce and reach, driving 79% channel growth in United States alone, and a 1/10 market share index versus traditional retail. In this setup, springboard and evolv ventures as platforms to accelerate our innovation to consumers, to customers and find new ways to disrupt ourselves.
So when you think about the sustainability of our growth, breakthrough innovation, strong in-store activity, distribution gain and white space expansion are all coming together. In fact, our consumption turnaround in United States has been driven by brand-building initiatives across the portfolio, not just a few categories. We are sustaining momentum in brands where we have been successful like Heinz, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer bacon, Classico, Kraft and our frozen and snack categories at large, all growing mid-single digits in 2018. Turning around other key brands like Kraft mac & cheese, Oscar Mayer hotdogs and [indiscernible] to low single-digit growth after several years of decline. Stabilizing historically challenged brands like Kraft salad dressing, mayo and our kids single-serve beverage business after years of mid-single-digit declines. And building new brands into meaningful platforms for growth, like P3, which now $120 million platform; Devour, a $7 million brand in less than 3 years; and Just Crack an Egg at $50 million after only 12 months. While some of this was supported by incremental promotion and price investments to improve consumption and distribution trends, we saw strong LOIs and created a solid base of support and commercial momentum for 2019.  
Where we fell short in 2018 was operations. Specifically, our entire EBITDA miss was driven by net savings versus expectations within our United States supply chain. To be fair, we must first recognize that our team operate at industry-leading levels globally; in quality, with top-tier performance in the industry; in safety, with our best results ever; and in customer service, achieving industry-leading case through rates and all-time in full delivery rates as we saw volumes ramp up. 
The core cause of our shortfall in 2018 was forecasting the pace and magnitude of our savings curve in 2018, not merger-related synergies and not an increase in ZBB costs. In fact, ZBB delivered savings across all fixed-cost package outside of our commercial investments and helped to fund our initiative.
To put our performance in context, we started 2018 expecting approximately 3% growth inflation, excluding key commodity costs, with savings programs expected to offset gross inflation. We ended the year with approximately 3% inflation, net of savings, specifically driven by higher supply chain costs and low operational savings in United States. There is no question, we are disappointed that profitability did not ramp up with consumption gains as anticipated. We are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end. For that, we take full responsibility. And we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by touching planning process, procedures and organization structure.
In the end, we see 3 takeaways from 2018: one, we are successfully driving sustainable consumption growth; two, we have the ability to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins; and three, we need to better plan and execute our operational net savings initiatives.
Before we outline the 2019 plans, David will provide more details on our 2018 financials."
278212,601900684,1664559,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and hello, everyone.

As we show on Slide 3, while our overall performance fell short of our expectations, the year-on-year drivers are straightforward. Consumption-driven growth, negatively impacted by cost inflation, net of savings in the U.S., with tax savings offsetting lower EBITDA, higher depreciation and interest expense.
From a trend perspective, there are a few important details to highlight. On the top line, consumption-driven growth momentum continued to build through Q4. For total Kraft Heinz, Q4 volume/mix growth was 4%, with growth in every reporting segment, driven by innovation, marketing, white space and go-to-market investments and led by improved consumption in a vast majority of U.S. categories. 
Total company Q4 pricing was down 160 basis points, including 80 basis points from key commodity pass-through in the U.S. Also note that the sequential decline in pricing versus Q3 was accentuated by a deceleration in contribution from price in our Rest of World segment.
And regarding U.S. pricing trends, as Bernardo mentioned, we were happy with the returns and results on this front. To provide more context and adjust for program timing, it's useful to understand the key drivers of U.S. pricing from a second half perspective. U.S. pricing in the second half of 2018 was down 2.4 percentage points, with 1 point from passing through lower key commodity costs. So U.S. pricing, net of key commodity impacts, was down 1.4% in the second half. Out of this, 40 basis points of the decline was primarily related to defending our natural cheese business by closing price gaps to private label. The remaining 1 point was a combination of opportunistic price investments and support of our innovation pipeline to stimulate incremental consumption with good lift and solid returns. Looking forward and excluding the impacts of key commodity pass-through, we do not expect pricing to be down in 2019, either in the U.S. or globally.
Moving to EBITDA. We said on our last call that we expected our EBITDA growth rate to improve beginning in Q4. While this turned out directionally accurate, Q4 constant currency adjusted EBITDA was significantly below the expectations we previously outlined. As Bernardo mentioned, this was driven by shortfalls in the United States. To be more specific, while the one-off factors we outlined in Q3, by and large, fell away as expected, anticipated savings did not materialize, particularly in our procurement area and, to a lesser extent, we had higher-than-anticipated costs in both manufacturing and logistics.
Taken together, top line trends and bottom line results lead us to the key factors we considered over the past few months in finalizing our 2019 plans outlined on Slide 4, and I'll hand it back to Bernardo to start it off."

Our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged on several front, continued fragmentation of consumer demand, a general lack of affordability to reinvest in brands, retail competition where assortment is likely to grow in importance and, finally, in the short term, ongoing cost inflation. 
Given our savings shortfall and the high inflation we're seeing, we could focus on maintaining or expanding margins, but risk forfeiting commercial growth and market share. By slowing our pace of innovation and channel development, focusing on marketing efficiency versus incremental marketing presence and compromising talent development at a critical time, we have not and we will not.
We are choosing to focus on improving our long-term growth trajectory and returns by: driving consumption and market share; leveraging next-generation capabilities for brand and category advantage; and importantly, securing the right talent in areas critical to growth. In fact, in line of the industry backdrop, we have concluded that there is no better time for Kraft Heinz to improve our growth profile. 
And looking forward, we have set 3 objectives for 2019: first, leverage our industry-leading margins to sustain our commercial momentum; second, more actively manage our portfolio; and third, strengthen our balance sheet as we continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. I will cover our commercial growth initiative, and David will outline our portfolio, capital restructure and financial expectations.
By far, the biggest and the best thing you can do to build the long-term value of our portfolio is to capture sustainable commercial growth by building on the sales momentum from 2018. And we have the stronger global pipeline we ever had to go after incremental consumer demand. In the United States, we'll be launching a record level of innovation, improving base consumption, velocities and leveraging brands and go-to-market investments. 
In Canada, the priority is reignite consumption in peanut butter as well as sauces and condiments. In Europe and Rest of the World markets, white space initiatives will focus on driving incremental sauces consumption and opening new geographies. And in foodservice, all regions have significant opportunities to gain distribution and white space.
We will support these initiatives with fully funded brand programs, taking advantage of our superior media efficiency or cost per impression, and increasing our media effectiveness, our sales lift per impression by deploying new creative tools in digital marketing.
In a nutshell, we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had, backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged, category managed and go-to-market initiatives to win assortment and improve distribution across all channels, including e-commerce. And we plan to do this while we maintain industry-leading margins.
Now let me turn back to David as the remaining objectives are a big part of his 2019 goals."
278212,601900684,1664559,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","I'll start with our financial expectations going forward on Slide 6.

Regarding top line, we are now well-positioned to continue organic net sales growth, driven by incremental consumption gains. This will reflect volume/mix growth from innovation, distribution and white space initiatives and pricing actions that balance cost inflation and our market share objectives.
On pricing, note that we exited 2018 at strong levels of merchandise and support and distribution. And price gaps are currently in a better place, so we do not expect pricing to be a drag year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. In fact, our U.S. business recently announced list price increases that are scheduled to take effect late in Q1.
From an organic growth perspective, in the very near term, Q1 is likely to decline versus the prior year due to unfavorable trade timing and a shift in Easter-related shipments to Q2 this year from Q1 last year. Trade timing in Canada, comparisons with a very strong winter soup season in the U.K. and destocking in Asia Pacific. For the year, we are targeting positive organic net sales growth, with commercial gains partially offset by price elasticity. And on a nominal basis, a combination of currency headwinds and divestitures is likely to result in a 3 to 4 percentage point headwind to net sales.
Regarding profitability, we fully expect to maintain industry-leading margins. At the same time, we think it's prudent to begin the year by properly level-setting expectations. To do so, as a one-off for 2019, we are breaking with our established guidance practices and setting a range for expected adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for this year. This includes: commercial gains offset by stepped up support of marketing, innovation, e-commerce and people; another year of low to mid-single-digit percentage non-key commodity inflation, net of cost savings; as well as foreign exchange rates and the 2 divestitures already announced.
In addition, we currently expect to begin 2019 with a first quarter that is likely to see a high-teens decline in adjusted EBITDA in percentage terms. We will be up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year, particularly in light of our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up commercial spending levels and with pricing not taking effect until late Q1.
Finally, at the EPS line, while we continue to believe that we can deliver top-tier growth, it will take hold from 2020 onwards. This is because in addition to our EBITDA outlook, 2019 will see approximately $0.25 of nonoperating headwinds versus 2018. This will come from a combination of several factors: $80 million of incremental depreciation expense; a roughly $120 million reduction in the other income line, mainly due to rising interest rates, increasing pension interest costs and less favorable market returns on planned assets assumed versus 2018; approximately $40 million of additional interest expense and a full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.
Taken together, top line, EBITDA and EPS drivers, while we expect to take a step backwards in 2019, we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards, driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands, cost structures and capabilities.
The rest of our plan is focused on how we can take additional steps to improve our portfolio's growth trajectory, strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves against inorganic opportunities. It starts with the potential for more active portfolio management, specifically through divestitures as a way to further improve our growth and returns as well as accelerate our deleveraging. 
The recent transactions we have announced, Indian beverages and Canada Natural Cheese, provide a good template of precedent for additional actions to exit areas with no clear path to competitive advantage and sell assets with strong valuations with some earnings dilution. We have now dedicated more resources, adding experience with Carlos Piani fully focused on our portfolio management efforts. And as we're able to execute such actions, we will look to deleverage with the proceeds, which leads to our next objective, further strengthening our balance sheet.
I think it's important to first recognize that we have the capacity to drive industry-leading cash generation along with industry-leading margins and expect to hold existing working capital and CapEx levels even as we drive the growth agenda we've outlined. In addition, given the industry backdrop and opportunities in front of us, we now see even greater strategic advantage in accelerating our deleveraging towards our ongoing 3x leverage target and strengthening the term structure of our debt. To do this, we're undertaking 2 specific actions: first, we intend to dedicate the divestiture proceeds from the sale of our India beverage and Canada Natural Cheese businesses to debt reduction. We also intend to do the same with proceeds from additional divestitures we are currently considering.
Second, today, we're announcing a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share or $1.60 per year, down from a rate of $2.50 per year. This will not only provide us greater balance sheet flexibility, it will also establish a base dividend that we can grow consistent with EBITDA growth over time. And we are comfortable that this level of dividend can accommodate the 2 divestitures we have already announced as well as those we are currently considering. These initiatives will accelerate the strengthening of an already solid balance sheet with a fully funded pension plan and continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bernardo to close."

Before we take your questions, I think it's useful to put our progress to date, our plans and priorities as well as our expectations beyond 2019 into context.

Beginning in 2018 and into 2019, we'll focus on leveraging our industry-leading margins to establish key growth pillars through innovation and white space expansion, accelerate the global deployment of advantage capabilities across all channels and geographies and now more actively managing our portfolio for better growth and returns. From 2020, we expect to see growth on both the top and bottom lines, as the full leverage of our advantage brands, cost structure and investments flows to the P&L.

I think the good framework for the things we're looking today, and that's exactly the point you are right now."

So let me step back for a second and I can break down our 2019 outlook a bit more and get a sense for our EBITDA expectations year-over-year. So overall, we expect gains from consumption growth to be in line with the stepped-up spending behind our initiatives. So really, the main drivers for the expected EBITDA decline year-over-year are a few factors: first, the net inflation that we talked about that we expect to see again in 2019; the divestitures I talked about; FX; and to a lesser extent, variable compensation. So to be more specific, if you assume the midpoint of our range or roughly $700 million decline year-over-year, let me elaborate on the 4 main drivers behind that. So first off, on the commercial side, again, we should be neutral on the bottom line as we expect the positive contribution from further consumption gains to be in line with the stepped-up investments as we accelerate the pace of our innovation, base business performance and channel development; second, beyond that, roughly half of the total EBITDA decline or roughly $300 million to $400 million is driven by continued inflation, net of cost savings, in the low to mid-single-digit range, consistent with what we saw in 2018. So this will be driven by another year of mid-single-digit growth -- low to mid-single-digit growth inflation, excluding key commodities. And given the recent experience, actions we've taken to replan the savings and pushing out the savings curve. Third, we expect the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the divestitures we've already announced, that should drive another $250 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA versus 2018. And then, finally, we have an impact from variable compensation, which is another roughly $80 million year-over-year. So taken together, this will put us where we saw the highest margin in the industry, and we believe that is the right base to build from. So to elaborate more on why we're confident even with the miss in expectations that we saw in Q4 and the decline in EBITDA that we're seeing in 2019, let me elaborate a little bit on why we're so confident in 2020. First, on the top line, we should be very well-positioned for solid organic growth globally, okay? We're already seeing real consumption-driven growth in the U.S. and globally today that we're able to create in the second half of 2018. And in 2019, we expect to further improve our consumption rate behind the largest innovation pipeline that we've ever had and more support on the core business. And we have a rapidly growing international business with significant exposure to emerging markets and white space opportunities to accelerate that growth globally. At EBITDA, in 2019, we are spending ahead to support an even larger innovation pipeline that I mentioned and accelerating channel development, particularly in e-commerce. So the right spending in commercial support levels, capabilities and marketing will have been established this year in 2019. And then, on the cost side, the extraordinary inflation that we're seeing in 2018 and that we're now seeing in 2019 from things like tariffs and transportation should mitigate over time as we're starting to see in the spot markets today. And we're also confident that we will be able to -- we'll be in a much stronger position to manage those costs through pricing and our savings curve going forward in 2020. And finally, at EPS, our nonoperating below-the-line cost that I talked about should be at run rate levels, so that we can leverage the organic growth into both EBITDA and EPS growth in 2020 going forward."

So again, let me step back for a second and kind of walk through our Q4 performance versus our original expectations to provide a little more context, and then I'll hand it over to Bernardo to provide a little more color on what we're doing differently to make sure this doesn't happen. On the Q3 call, we did expect Q4 EBITDA growth to improve sequentially, as I talked about, versus the 14% year-over-year decline we saw in Q3, okay? And that assumption was based off of the fact that we expect the transitory headwinds and one-offs in Q3 that would fall away, which would effectively bring our run rate growth to more of a high single-digit decline year-over-year. And then, on top of that, we expected savings to accelerate, leading to a significant sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, in the end, the transitory one-off factors did fall away as expected, but we had 3 negative impacts in the quarter that we didn't expect: first, we had roughly a 3.5 percentage point impact of unanticipated cost headwinds, which I can explain further; second, we didn't have the anticipated savings curve that we expected to materialize in the quarter to partially offset the inflation we're seeing; and then, finally, we did have an incremental FX drag of about 1.5 percentage points in Q4 versus Q3. So given all these factors, the year-on-year decline in Q4 is much closer than Q3, and we didn't see the sequential improvement. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to answer your other question."

And to put into context, that compares to our overall procurement spend of over $11 billion, which excludes big 4 commodities spend.

Let me start from the -- answering the private label question and then we move to the 2019 pricing. Why we're seeing the private label expanding and it's doing so at a more -- we are seeing this happening in a more restrained pace, around 0.2 points of share in Q4. It was a material step down from previous quarters that we're seeing. And we are seeing most pressure in areas where low commodities, excess capacity and retail competition come together, mostly now in some subsegments of our cheese portfolio. In natural cheese, we see also the retailers have used price matching to drive traffic, and being able to invest back, that was part of our price investment we've had in the second half to narrow the price gaps. And after that, we saw branded and private label share starting to stabilize. So again, we're always monitoring the value proposition of the market and continue to innovate and differentiate our brands and products on that matter. When you think about 2019 pricing, we already have announced our pricing. We did an analysis in terms of to define the right part of the portfolio that we are pricing, being very cautious about the balance between sales and cost while still providing the best value equation and helping to drive category growth. And we are seeing, we already announced, this thing is going to take effect in Q1. And we expect overall -- our overall pricing to turn positive over the course of '19."

With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where w",859,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where we did not and why. 
At this time last year, we set plans to drive profitable sales and consumption growth by investing in deployment of new capabilities and a strong pipeline of innovation and white space initiatives. And while we expected this to translate into near-term margin pressure in United States and Rest of the World segments, we anticipated stronger net savings to deliver constant currency EBITDA growth for the year. Overall, we successfully drove profitable sales and consumption growth accelerated, but we fell short in delivering the net savings we expect.
From a commercial perspective, we firmly restarted organic growth. In United States, our second half performance came back to offset the self-inflicted losses from the first half of the year. We became one of the few within our industry posting real volume-driven growth, growing volume/mix nearly 4%.
In Canada, similar to United States, we ended the year with positive consumption growth from improvements in coffee and cheese. Our EMEA business build momentum on the back of white space gains in condiments and encouraging share trends across our U.K. base. In Rest of the World, we are gaining traction in driving real growth with the startup of our new sauces plant in Brazil, and our Cerebos acquisition in Australia and New Zealand.
In our Foodservice business, on a global basis, is approaching $4 billion in sales and gaining momentum from white space initiatives in all markets. And this leads to the second aspect of our scorecard, the significant progress we made developing and deploying strategically advanced capabilities. We had strong returns on investment in marketing, category management and e-store sales. We continue to expand in e-commerce and reach, driving 79% channel growth in United States alone, and a 1/10 market share index versus traditional retail. In this setup, springboard and Evolv Ventures as platforms to accelerate our innovation to consumers, to customers and find new ways to disrupt ourselves.
So when you think about the sustainability of our growth, breakthrough innovation, strong in-store activity, distribution gain and white space expansion are all coming together. In fact, our consumption turnaround in United States has been driven by brand-building initiatives across the portfolio, not just a few categories. We are sustaining momentum in brands where we have been successful like Heinz, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer bacon, Classico, Kraft and our frozen and snack categories at large, all growing mid-single digits in 2018. Turning around other key brands like Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer hotdogs [ to name one ] to low single-digit growth after several years of decline. Stabilizing historically challenged brands like Kraft salad dressing, mayo and our kids single-serve beverage business after years of mid-single-digit declines. And building new brands into meaningful platforms for growth, like P3, which now $120 million platform; Devour, a $7 million brand in less than 3 years; and Just Crack an Egg at $50 million after only 12 months. While some of this was supported by incremental promotion and price investments to improve consumption and distribution trends, we saw strong LOIs and created a solid base of support and commercial momentum for 2019.  
Where we fell short in 2018 was operations. Specifically, our entire EBITDA miss was driven by net savings versus expectations within our United States supply chain. To be fair, we must first recognize that our team operate at industry-leading levels globally; in quality, with top-tier performance in the industry; in safety, with our best results ever; and in customer service, achieving industry-leading case through rates and all-time in full delivery rates as we saw volumes ramp up. 
The core cause of our shortfall in 2018 was forecasting the pace and magnitude of our savings curve in 2018, not merger-related synergies and not an increase in ZBB costs. In fact, ZBB delivered savings across all fixed-cost package outside of our commercial investments and helped to fund our initiative.
To put our performance in context, we started 2018 expecting approximately 3% growth inflation, excluding key commodity costs, with savings programs expected to offset gross inflation. We ended the year with approximately 3% inflation, net of savings, specifically driven by higher supply chain costs and low operational savings in United States. There is no question we are disappointed that profitability did not ramp up with consumption gains as anticipated. We are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end. For that, we take full responsibility. And we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by touching planning process, procedures and organization structure.
In the end, we see 3 takeaways from 2018: one, we are successfully driving sustainable consumption growth; two, we have the ability to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins; and three, we need to better plan and execute our operational net savings initiatives.
Before we outline the 2019 plans, David will provide more details on our 2018 financials."
278212,601900684,1664656,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Bernardo, and hello, everyone.

As we show on Slide 3, while our overall performance fell short of our expectations, the year-on-year drivers are straightforward. Consumption-driven growth, negatively impacted by cost inflation, net of savings in the U.S., with tax savings offsetting lower EBITDA, higher depreciation and interest expense.
From a trend perspective, there are a few important details to highlight. On the top line, consumption-driven growth momentum continued to build through Q4. For total Kraft Heinz, Q4 volume/mix growth was 4%, with growth in every reporting segment, driven by innovation, marketing, white space and go-to-market investments and led by improved consumption in a vast majority of U.S. categories. 
Total company Q4 pricing was down 160 basis points, including 80 basis points from key commodity pass-through in the U.S. Also note that the sequential decline in pricing versus Q3 was accentuated by a deceleration in contribution from price in our Rest of World segment.
And regarding U.S. pricing trends, as Bernardo mentioned, we were happy with the returns and results on this front. To provide more context and adjust for program timing, it's useful to understand the key drivers of U.S. pricing from a second half perspective. U.S. pricing in the second half of 2018 was down 2.4 percentage points, with 1 point from passing through lower key commodity costs. So U.S. pricing, net of key commodity impacts, was down 1.4% in the second half. Out of this, 40 basis points of the decline was primarily related to defending our natural cheese business by closing price gaps to private label. The remaining 1 point was a combination of opportunistic price investments and support of our innovation pipeline to stimulate incremental consumption with good lift and solid returns. Looking forward and excluding the impact of key commodity pass-through, we do not expect pricing to be down in 2019, either in the U.S. or globally.
Moving to EBITDA. We said on our last call that we expected our EBITDA growth rate to improve beginning in Q4. While this turned out directionally accurate, Q4 constant currency adjusted EBITDA was significantly below the expectations we previously outlined. As Bernardo mentioned, this was driven by shortfalls in the United States. To be more specific, while the one-off factors we outlined in Q3, by and large, fell away as expected, anticipated savings did not materialize, particularly in our procurement area and, to a lesser extent, we had higher-than-anticipated costs in both manufacturing and logistics.
Taken together, top line trends and bottom line results lead us to the key factors we considered over the past few months in finalizing our 2019 plans outlined on Slide 4, and I'll hand it back to Bernardo to start it off."

Our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged on several front, continued fragmentation of consumer demand, a general lack of affordability to reinvest in brands, retail competition where assortment is likely to grow in importance and, finally, in the short term, ongoing cost inflation. 
Given our savings shortfall and the high inflation we're seeing, we could focus on maintaining or expanding margins but risk forfeiting commercial growth and market share. By slowing our pace of innovation and channel development, focusing on marketing efficiency versus incremental marketing presence and compromising talent development at a critical time, we have not and we will not.
We are choosing to focus on improving our long-term growth trajectory and returns by: driving consumption and market share; leveraging next-generation capabilities for brand and category advantage; and importantly, securing the right talent in areas critical to growth. In fact, in light of the industry backdrop, we have concluded that there is no better time for Kraft Heinz to improve our growth profile. 
And looking forward, we have set 3 objectives for 2019: first, leverage our industry-leading margins to sustain our commercial momentum; second, more actively manage our portfolio; and third, strengthen our balance sheet as we continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. I will cover our commercial growth initiatives, and David will outline our portfolio, capital restructure and financial expectations.
By far, the biggest and the best thing you can do to build the long-term value of our portfolio is to capture sustainable commercial growth by building on the sales momentum from 2018. And we have the stronger global pipeline we ever had to go after incremental consumer demand. In the United States, we'll be launching a record level of innovation, improving base consumption, velocities and leveraging brands and go-to-market investments. 
In Canada, the priority is reignite consumption in peanut butter as well as sauces and condiments. In Europe and Rest of the World markets, whitespace initiatives will focus on driving incremental sauces consumption and opening new geographies. And in Foodservice, all regions have significant opportunities to gain distribution and whitespace.
We will support these initiatives with fully funded brand programs, taking advantage of our superior media efficiency or cost per impression, and increasing our media effectiveness, our sales lift per impression by deploying new creative tools in digital marketing.
In a nutshell, we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had, backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged, category managed and go-to-market initiatives to win assortment and improve distribution across all channels, including e-commerce. And we plan to do this while we maintain industry-leading margins.
Now let me turn back to David as the remaining objectives are a big part of his 2019 goals."

On pricing, note that we exited 2018 at strong levels of merchandising support and distribution. And price gaps are currently in a better place, so we do not expect pricing to be a drag year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. In fact, our U.S. business recently announced list price increases that are scheduled to take effect late in Q1.
From an organic growth perspective, in the very near term, Q1 is likely to decline versus the prior year due to unfavorable trade timing and a shift in Easter-related shipments to Q2 this year from Q1 last year, trade timing in Canada, comparisons with a very strong winter soup season in the U.K. and destocking in Asia Pacific. For the year, we are targeting positive organic net sales growth, with commercial gains partially offset by price elasticity. And on a nominal basis, a combination of currency headwinds and divestitures is likely to result in a 3 to 4-percentage-point headwind to net sales.
Regarding profitability, we fully expect to maintain industry-leading margins. At the same time, we think it's prudent to begin the year by properly level-setting expectations. To do so, as a one-off for 2019, we are breaking with our established guidance practices and setting a range for expected adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for this year. This includes: commercial gains offset by stepped-up support of marketing, innovation, e-commerce and people; another year of low to mid-single-digit percentage non-key commodity inflation, net of cost savings; as well as foreign exchange rates and the 2 divestitures already announced.
In addition, we currently expect to begin 2019 with a first quarter that is likely to see a high-teens decline in adjusted EBITDA in percentage terms. We will be up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year, particularly in light of our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up commercial spending levels and with pricing not taking effect until late Q1.
Finally, at the EPS line, while we continue to believe that we can deliver top-tier growth, it will take hold from 2020 onwards. This is because in addition to our EBITDA outlook, 2019 will see approximately $0.25 of nonoperating headwinds versus 2018. This will come from a combination of several factors: $80 million of incremental depreciation expense; a roughly $120 million reduction in the other income line, mainly due to rising interest rates, increasing pension interest costs and less favorable market returns on planned assets assumed versus 2018; approximately $40 million of additional interest expense and a full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.
Taken together, top line, EBITDA and EPS drivers, while we expect to take a step backwards in 2019, we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards, driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands, cost structures and capabilities.
The rest of our plan is focused on how we can take additional steps to improve our portfolio's growth trajectory, strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves against inorganic opportunities. It starts with the potential for more active portfolio management, specifically through divestitures as a way to further improve our growth and returns as well as accelerate our deleveraging. 
The recent transactions we have announced, Indian beverages and Canada Natural Cheese, provide a good template of precedent for additional actions to exit areas with no clear path to competitive advantage and sell assets with strong valuations with some earnings dilution. We have now dedicated more resources, adding experience with Carlos Piani fully focused on our portfolio management efforts. And as we're able to execute such actions, we will look to deleverage with the proceeds, which leads to our next objective, further strengthening our balance sheet.
I think it's important to first recognize that we have the capacity to drive industry-leading cash generation along with industry-leading margins and expect to hold existing working capital and CapEx levels even as we drive the growth agenda we've outlined. In addition, given the industry backdrop and opportunities in front of us, we now see even greater strategic advantage in accelerating our deleveraging towards our ongoing 3x leverage target and strengthening the term structure of our debt. To do this, we're undertaking 2 specific actions: first, we intend to dedicate the divestiture proceeds from the sale of our India beverage and Canada Natural Cheese businesses to debt reduction. We also intend to do the same with proceeds from additional divestitures we are currently considering.
Second, today, we're announcing a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share or $1.60 per year, down from a rate of $2.50 per year. This will not only provide us greater balance sheet flexibility, it will also establish a base dividend that we can grow consistent with EBITDA growth over time. And we are comfortable that this level of dividend can accommodate the 2 divestitures we have already announced as well as those we are currently considering. These initiatives will accelerate the strengthening of an already solid balance sheet with a fully funded pension plan and continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bernardo to close."

Before we take your questions, I think it's useful to put our progress to date, our plans and priorities as well as our expectations beyond 2019 into context.
When we put Kraft Heinz together in mid-2015, our focus through 2017 was clarity on necessary product renovation and supply chain integration, taking out costs that drops no benefit to our consumers, establishing retool and routines, and testing and learning new tools to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
Beginning in 2018 and into 2019, we'll focus on leveraging our industry-leading margins to establish key growth pillars through innovation and whitespace expansion, accelerate the global deployment of advantage capabilities across all channels and geographies and now more actively managing our portfolio for better growth and returns. From 2020, we expect to see growth on both the top and bottom lines, as the full leverage of our advantage brands, cost structure and investments flows to the P&L.
So to summarize, we have continued to invest and focus on building our highly scalable operational model, to position ourselves for sustainable organic growth and returns and doing so at the time when the need for industry to modernize and consolidate is more evident than it was 5 or even 3 years ago.
Now we will be happy to take your questions."

So let me step back for a second and I can break down our 2019 outlook a bit more and get a sense for our EBITDA expectations year-over-year. So overall, we expect gains from consumption growth to be in line with the stepped-up spending behind our initiatives. So really, the main drivers for the expected EBITDA decline year-over-year are a few factors: first, the net inflation that we talked about that we expect to see again in 2019; the divestitures I talked about; FX; and to a lesser extent, variable compensation. So to be more specific, if you assume the midpoint of our range or a roughly $700 million decline year-over-year, let me elaborate on the 4 main drivers behind that. So first off, on the commercial side, again, we should be neutral on the bottom line as we expect the positive contribution from further consumption gains to be in line with the stepped-up investments as we accelerate the pace of our innovation, base business performance and channel development; second, beyond that, roughly half of the total EBITDA decline or roughly $300 million to $400 million is driven by continued inflation, net of cost savings, in the low to mid-single-digit range, consistent with what we saw in 2018. So this will be driven by another year of mid-single-digit growth -- low to mid-single-digit growth inflation, excluding key commodities. And given the recent experience, actions we've taken to replan the savings and pushing out the savings curve. Third, we expect the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the divestitures we've already announced, that should drive another $250 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA versus 2018. And then, finally, we have an impact from variable compensation, which is another roughly $80 million year-over-year. So taken together, this will put us where we still have the highest margin in the industry, and we believe that is the right base to build from. So to elaborate more on why we're confident even with the miss in expectations that we saw in Q4 and the decline in EBITDA that we're seeing in 2019, let me elaborate a little bit on why we're so confident in 2020. First, on the top line, we should be very well positioned for solid organic growth globally, okay? We're already seeing real consumption-driven growth in the U.S. and globally today that we're able to create in the second half of 2018. And in 2019, we expect to further improve our consumption rate behind the largest innovation pipeline that we've ever had and more support on the core business. And we have a rapidly growing international business with significant exposure to emerging markets and whitespace opportunities to accelerate that growth globally. At EBITDA, in 2019, we are spending ahead to support an even larger innovation pipeline that I mentioned and accelerating channel development, particularly in e-commerce. So the right spending in commercial support levels, capabilities and marketing will have been established this year in 2019. And then, on the cost side, the extraordinary inflation that we're seeing in 2018 and that we're now seeing in 2019 from things like tariffs and transportation should mitigate over time as we're starting to see in the spot markets today. And we're also confident that we will be able to -- we'll be in a much stronger position to manage those costs through pricing and our savings curve going forward in 2020. And finally, at EPS, our nonoperating below-the-line cost that I talked about should be at run rate levels, so that we can leverage the organic growth into both EBITDA and EPS growth 2020 going forward."

So again, let me step back for a second and kind of walk through our Q4 performance versus our original expectations to provide a little more context, and then I'll hand it over to Bernardo to provide a little more color on what we're doing differently to make sure this doesn't happen. On the Q3 call, we did expect Q4 EBITDA growth to improve sequentially, as I talked about, versus the 14% year-over-year decline we saw in Q3, okay? And that assumption was based off of the fact that we expect the transitory headwinds and one-offs in Q3 that would fall away, which would effectively bring our run rate growth to more of a high single-digit decline year-over-year. And then, on top of that, we expected savings to accelerate, leading to a significant sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, in the end, the transitory one-off factors did fall away as expected, but we had 3 negative impacts in the quarter that we didn't expect: first, we had roughly a 3.5 percentage point impact of unanticipated cost headwinds, which I can explain further; second, we didn't have the anticipated savings curve that we expected to materialize in the quarter to partially offset the inflation we're seeing; and then, finally, we did have an incremental FX drag of about 1.5 percentage points in Q4 versus Q3. So given all these factors, the year-on-year decline in Q4 is much closer than Q3, and we didn't see the sequential improvement. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to answer your other question."

And to put into context, that compares to our overall procurement spend of over $11 billion, which excludes big 4 commodities spend.

It was a material step down from previous quarters that we're seeing. And we are seeing the most pressure in areas where low commodities, excess capacity and retail competition come together, mostly now in some subsegments of our cheese portfolio. In natural cheese, we see also the retailers have used price matching to drive traffic, and being able to invest back, that was part of our price investment we've had in the second half to narrow the price gaps. And after that, we saw branded and private label share starting to stabilize. So again, we're always monitoring the value proposition of the market and continue to innovate and differentiate our brands and products on that matter. When you think about 2019 pricing, we already have announced our pricing. We did an analysis in terms of to define the right part of the portfolio that we are pricing, being very conscious about the balance between sales and cost while still providing the best value equation and helping to drive category growth.

Just to be clear, by far and away, the majority of the impairment, which was really concentrated in these 3 businesses that I mentioned, it was, by far and away, driven by the second half performance and the new level of margin and profitability that we're talking about versus what it was before. So the margin profile and what we established in the second half was really the key driver behind the impairment."

I think you made a statement, David, in your script that in the forecast, the savings programs had been ""pushed out."" So I'm a little confused as to kind of why that's happening and why can't you achieve the internal savings at the same time that you're generating the revenue performance? And then, related to that, if you didn't hit the savings that you expected in the fourth quarter, don't those savings programs show up in like the first quarter of '19 or second quarter of '19?

As David said, our objective is to deleverage, right, to 3x in the middle term at a faster pace than we're doing today. With that, and the knowledge you have of the portfolio today, with our competitive advantage by brands and category, allows us to be in a very good position to understand the magnitude that what we can do or we cannot do.

So on the savings side, we were overly optimistic on our ability to offset significant inflation in the quarter. And again, that drove a significant part of the miss. So this savings miss was really a combination of 2 things, under-delivery from supplier negotiations and delayed manufacturing projects. And to give you a little bit of color on what some of those projects were like, they included line optimizations, yield improvements and assumed even better performance on some of our footprint plans that we discussed previously. So because of this miss, as Bernardo said, we took significant action to address our processes, planning and structure internally and simultaneously have spent a lot of time and focus really revisiting our savings projects and we replanned. As a function of that, our savings curve is being pushed out as we implement those changes, as we revisit our savings programs going forward. So that's really what's driving the delay in the savings curve, and that's embedded in my 2019 expectations."

With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where w",859,"Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where we did not and why. 
At this time last year, we set plans to drive profitable sales and consumption growth by investing in deployment of new capabilities and a strong pipeline of innovation and white space initiatives. And while we expected this to translate into near-term margin pressure in United States and Rest of the World segments, we anticipated stronger net savings to deliver constant currency EBITDA growth for the year. Overall, we successfully drove profitable sales and consumption growth accelerated, but we fell short in delivering the net savings we expect.
From a commercial perspective, we firmly restarted organic growth. In United States, our second half performance came back to offset the self-inflicted losses from the first half of the year. We became one of the few within our industry posting real volume-driven growth, growing volume/mix nearly 4%.
In Canada, similar to United States, we ended the year with positive consumption growth from improvements in coffee and cheese. Our EMEA business build momentum on the back of white space gains in condiments and encouraging share trends across our U.K. base. In Rest of the World, we are gaining traction in driving real growth with the startup of our new sauces plant in Brazil, and our Cerebos acquisition in Australia and New Zealand.
In our Foodservice business, on a global basis, is approaching $4 billion in sales and gaining momentum from white space initiatives in all markets. And this leads to the second aspect of our scorecard, the significant progress we made developing and deploying strategically advanced capabilities. We had strong returns on investment in marketing, category management and e-store sales. We continue to expand in e-commerce and reach, driving 79% channel growth in United States alone, and a 1/10 market share index versus traditional retail. In this setup, springboard and Evolv Ventures as platforms to accelerate our innovation to consumers, to customers and find new ways to disrupt ourselves.
So when you think about the sustainability of our growth, breakthrough innovation, strong in-store activity, distribution gain and white space expansion are all coming together. In fact, our consumption turnaround in United States has been driven by brand-building initiatives across the portfolio, not just a few categories. We are sustaining momentum in brands where we have been successful like Heinz, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer bacon, Classico, Kraft and our frozen and snack categories at large, all growing mid-single digits in 2018. Turning around other key brands like Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer hotdogs [ to name one ] to low single-digit growth after several years of decline. Stabilizing historically challenged brands like Kraft salad dressing, mayo and our kids single-serve beverage business after years of mid-single-digit declines. And building new brands into meaningful platforms for growth, like P3, which now $120 million platform; Devour, a $7 million brand in less than 3 years; and Just Crack an Egg at $50 million after only 12 months. While some of this was supported by incremental promotion and price investments to improve consumption and distribution trends, we saw strong LOIs and created a solid base of support and commercial momentum for 2019. 
Where we fell short in 2018 was operations. Specifically, our entire EBITDA miss was driven by net savings versus expectations within our United States supply chain. To be fair, we must first recognize that our team operate at industry-leading levels globally; in quality, with top-tier performance in the industry; in safety, with our best results ever; and in customer service, achieving industry-leading case through rates and all-time in full delivery rates as we saw volumes ramp up. 
The core cause of our shortfall in 2018 was forecasting the pace and magnitude of our savings curve in 2018, not merger-related synergies and not an increase in ZBB costs. In fact, ZBB delivered savings across all fixed-cost package outside of our commercial investments and helped to fund our initiative.
To put our performance in context, we started 2018 expecting approximately 3% growth inflation, excluding key commodity costs, with savings programs expected to offset gross inflation. We ended the year with approximately 3% inflation, net of savings, specifically driven by higher supply chain costs and low operational savings in United States. There is no question we are disappointed that profitability did not ramp up with consumption gains as anticipated. We are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end. For that, we take full responsibility. And we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by touching planning process, procedures and organization structure.
In the end, we see 3 takeaways from 2018: one, we are successfully driving sustainable consumption growth; two, we have the ability to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins; and three, we need to better plan and execute our operational net savings initiatives.
Before we outline the 2019 plans, David will provide more details on our 2018 financials."

As we show on Slide 3, while our overall performance fell short of our expectations, the year-on-year drivers are straightforward. Consumption-driven growth, negatively impacted by cost inflation, net of savings in the U.S., with tax savings offsetting lower EBITDA, higher depreciation and interest expense.
From a trend perspective, there are a few important details to highlight. On the top line, consumption-driven growth momentum continued to build through Q4. For total Kraft Heinz, Q4 volume/mix growth was 4%, with growth in every reporting segment, driven by innovation, marketing, white space and go-to-market investments and led by improved consumption in a vast majority of U.S. categories. 
Total company Q4 pricing was down 160 basis points, including 80 basis points from key commodity pass-through in the U.S. Also note that the sequential decline in pricing versus Q3 was accentuated by a deceleration in contribution from price in our Rest of World segment.
And regarding U.S. pricing trends, as Bernardo mentioned, we were happy with the returns and results on this front. To provide more context and adjust for program timing, it's useful to understand the key drivers of U.S. pricing from a second half perspective. U.S. pricing in the second half of 2018 was down 2.4 percentage points, with 1 point from passing through lower key commodity costs. So U.S. pricing, net of key commodity impacts, was down 1.4% in the second half. Out of this, 40 basis points of the decline was primarily related to defending our natural cheese business by closing price gaps to private label. The remaining 1 point was a combination of opportunistic price investments and support of our innovation pipeline to stimulate incremental consumption with good lift and solid returns. Looking forward and excluding the impact of key commodity pass-through, we do not expect pricing to be down in 2019, either in the U.S. or globally.
Moving to EBITDA. We said on our last call that we expected our EBITDA growth rate to improve beginning in Q4. While this turned out directionally accurate, Q4 constant currency adjusted EBITDA was significantly below the expectations we previously outlined. As Bernardo mentioned, this was driven by shortfalls in the United States. To be more specific, while the one-off factors we outlined in Q3, by and large, fell away as expected, anticipated savings did not materialize, particularly in our procurement area and, to a lesser extent, we had higher-than-anticipated costs in both manufacturing and logistics.
Taken together, top line trends and bottom line results lead us to the key factors we considered over the past few months in finalizing our 2019 plans outlined on Slide 4, and I'll hand it back to Bernardo to start it off."

Our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged on several front, continued fragmentation of consumer demand, a general lack of affordability to reinvest in brands, retail competition where assortment is likely to grow in importance and, finally, in the short term, ongoing cost inflation. 
Given our savings shortfall and the high inflation we're seeing, we could focus on maintaining or expanding margins but risk forfeiting commercial growth and market share. By slowing our pace of innovation and channel development, focusing on marketing efficiency versus incremental marketing presence and compromising talent development at a critical time, we have not and we will not.
We are choosing to focus on improving our long-term growth trajectory and returns by driving consumption and market share; leveraging next-generation capabilities for brand and category advantage; and importantly, securing the right talent in areas critical to growth. In fact, in light of the industry backdrop, we have concluded that there is no better time for Kraft Heinz to improve our growth profile. 
And looking forward, we have set 3 objectives for 2019: first, leverage our industry-leading margins to sustain our commercial momentum; second, more actively manage our portfolio; and third, strengthen our balance sheet as we continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. I will cover our commercial growth initiatives, and David will outline our portfolio, capital restructure and financial expectations.
By far, the biggest and the best thing you can do to build the long-term value of our portfolio is to capture sustainable commercial growth by building on the sales momentum from 2018. And we have the stronger global pipeline we ever had to go after incremental consumer demand. In the United States, we'll be launching a record level of innovation, improving base consumption, velocities and leveraging brands and go-to-market investments. 
In Canada, the priority is reignite consumption in peanut butter as well as sauces and condiments. In Europe and Rest of the World markets, whitespace initiatives will focus on driving incremental sauces consumption and opening new geographies. And in Foodservice, all regions have significant opportunities to gain distribution and whitespace.
We will support these initiatives with fully funded brand programs, taking advantage of our superior media efficiency or cost per impression, and increasing our media effectiveness, our sales lift per impression by deploying new creative tools in digital marketing.
In a nutshell, we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had, backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged, category managed and go-to-market initiatives to win assortment and improve distribution across all channels, including e-commerce. And we plan to do this while we maintain industry-leading margins.
Now let me turn back to David as the remaining objectives are a big part of his 2019 goals."
278212,601900684,1666891,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","I'll start with our financial expectations going forward on Slide 6.

Regarding top line, we are now well positioned to continue organic net sales growth, driven by incremental consumption gains. This will reflect volume/mix growth from innovation, distribution and whitespace initiatives and pricing actions that balance cost inflation and our market share objectives.
On pricing, note that we exited 2018 at strong levels of merchandising support and distribution. And price gaps are currently in a better place, so we do not expect pricing to be a drag year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. In fact, our U.S. business recently announced list price increases that are scheduled to take effect late in Q1.
From an organic growth perspective, in the very near term, Q1 is likely to decline versus the prior year due to unfavorable trade timing and a shift in Easter-related shipments to Q2 this year from Q1 last year, trade timing in Canada, comparisons with a very strong winter soup season in the U.K. and destocking in Asia Pacific. For the year, we are targeting positive organic net sales growth, with commercial gains partially offset by price elasticity. And on a nominal basis, a combination of currency headwinds and divestitures is likely to result in a 3 to 4-percentage-point headwind to net sales.
Regarding profitability, we fully expect to maintain industry-leading margins. At the same time, we think it's prudent to begin the year by properly level-setting expectations. To do so, as a one-off for 2019, we are breaking with our established guidance practices and setting a range for expected adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for this year. This includes commercial gains offset by stepped-up support of marketing, innovation, e-commerce and people; another year of low to mid-single-digit percentage non-key commodity inflation, net of cost savings; as well as foreign exchange rates and the 2 divestitures already announced.
In addition, we currently expect to begin 2019 with a first quarter that is likely to see a high-teens decline in adjusted EBITDA in percentage terms. We will be up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year, particularly in light of our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up commercial spending levels and with pricing not taking effect until late Q1.
Finally, at the EPS line, while we continue to believe that we can deliver top-tier growth, it will take hold from 2020 onwards. This is because in addition to our EBITDA outlook, 2019 will see approximately $0.25 of nonoperating headwinds versus 2018. This will come from a combination of several factors: $80 million of incremental depreciation expense; a roughly $120 million reduction in the other income line, mainly due to rising interest rates, increasing pension interest costs and less favorable market returns on planned assets assumed versus 2018; approximately $40 million of additional interest expense and a full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.
Taken together, top line, EBITDA and EPS drivers, while we expect to take a step backwards in 2019, we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards, driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands, cost structures and capabilities.
The rest of our plan is focused on how we can take additional steps to improve our portfolio's growth trajectory, strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves against inorganic opportunities. It starts with the potential for more active portfolio management, specifically through divestitures as a way to further improve our growth and returns as well as accelerate our deleveraging. 
The recent transactions we have announced, Indian beverages and Canada Natural Cheese, provide a good template of precedent for additional actions to exit areas with no clear path to competitive advantage and sell assets with strong valuations with some earnings dilution. We have now dedicated more resources, adding experience with Carlos Piani fully focused on our portfolio management efforts. And as we're able to execute such actions, we will look to deleverage with the proceeds, which leads to our next objective, further strengthening our balance sheet.
I think it's important to first recognize that we have the capacity to drive industry-leading cash generation along with industry-leading margins and expect to hold existing working capital and CapEx levels even as we drive the growth agenda we've outlined. In addition, given the industry backdrop and opportunities in front of us, we now see even greater strategic advantage in accelerating our deleveraging towards our ongoing 3x leverage target and strengthening the term structure of our debt. To do this, we're undertaking 2 specific actions: first, we intend to dedicate the divestiture proceeds from the sale of our India beverage and Canada Natural Cheese businesses to debt reduction. We also intend to do the same with proceeds from additional divestitures we are currently considering.
Second, today, we're announcing a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share or $1.60 per year, down from a rate of $2.50 per year. This will not only provide us greater balance sheet flexibility, it will also establish a base dividend that we can grow consistent with EBITDA growth over time. And we are comfortable that this level of dividend can accommodate the 2 divestitures we have already announced as well as those we are currently considering. These initiatives will accelerate the strengthening of an already solid balance sheet with a fully funded pension plan and continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bernardo to close."

Before we take your questions, I think it's useful to put our progress to date, our plans and priorities as well as our expectations beyond 2019 into context.
When we put Kraft Heinz together in mid-2015, our focus through 2017 was clarity on necessary product renovation and supply chain integration, taking out costs that drops no benefit to our consumers, establishing retool and routines, and testing and learning new tools to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
Beginning in 2018 and into 2019, we'll focus on leveraging our industry-leading margins to establish key growth pillars through innovation and whitespace expansion, accelerate the global deployment of advantage capabilities across all channels and geographies and now more actively managing our portfolio for better growth and returns. From 2020, we expect to see growth on both the top and bottom lines, as the full leverage of our advantage brands, cost structure and investments flows to the P&L.
So to summarize, we have continued to invest and focus on building our highly scalable operational model, to position ourselves for sustainable organic growth and returns and doing so at the time when the need for industry to modernize and consolidate is more evident than it was 5 or even 3 years ago.

So let me step back for a second and I can break down our 2019 outlook a bit more and get a sense for our EBITDA expectations year-over-year. So overall, we expect gains from consumption growth to be in line with the stepped-up spending behind our initiatives. So really, the main drivers for the expected EBITDA decline year-over-year are a few factors: first, the net inflation that we talked about that we expect to see again in 2019; the divestitures I talked about; FX; and to a lesser extent, variable compensation. So to be more specific, if you assume the midpoint of our range or a roughly $700 million decline year-over-year, let me elaborate on the 4 main drivers behind that. So first off, on the commercial side, again, we should be neutral on the bottom line as we expect the positive contribution from further consumption gains to be in line with the stepped-up investments as we accelerate the pace of our innovation, base business performance and channel development; second, beyond that, roughly half of the total EBITDA decline or roughly $300 million to $400 million is driven by continued inflation, net of cost savings, in the low to mid-single-digit range, consistent with what we saw in 2018. So this will be driven by another year of mid-single-digit growth -- low to mid-single-digit growth inflation, excluding key commodities. And given the recent experience, actions we've taken to replan the savings and pushing out the savings curve. Third, we expect the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the divestitures we've already announced, that should drive another $250 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA versus 2018. And then, finally, we have an impact from variable compensation, which is another roughly $80 million year-over-year. So taken together, this will put us where we still have the highest margin in the industry, and we believe that is the right base to build from. So to elaborate more on why we're confident even with the miss in expectations that we saw in Q4 and the decline in EBITDA that we're seeing in 2019, let me elaborate a little bit on why we're so confident in 2020. First, on the top line, we should be very well positioned for solid organic growth globally, okay? We're already seeing real consumption-driven growth in the U.S. and globally today that we're able to create in the second half of 2018. And in 2019, we expect to further improve our consumption rate behind the largest innovation pipeline that we've ever had and more support on the core business. And we have a rapidly growing international business with significant exposure to emerging markets and whitespace opportunities to accelerate that growth globally. At EBITDA, in 2019, we are spending ahead to support an even larger innovation pipeline that I mentioned and accelerating channel development, particularly in e-commerce. So the right spending in commercial support levels, capabilities and marketing will have been established this year in 2019. And then, on the cost side, the extraordinary inflation that we're seeing in 2018 and that we're now seeing in 2019 from things like tariffs and transportation should mitigate over time as we're starting to see in the spot markets today. And we're also confident that we will be able to -- we'll be in a much stronger position to manage those costs through pricing and our savings curve going forward in 2020. And finally, at EPS, our nonoperating below-the-line cost that I talked about should be at run rate levels, so that we can leverage the organic growth into both EBITDA and EPS growth 2020 going forward."

So again, let me step back for a second and kind of walk through our Q4 performance versus our original expectations to provide a little more context, and then I'll hand it over to Bernardo to provide a little more color on what we're doing differently to make sure this doesn't happen. On the Q3 call, we did expect Q4 EBITDA growth to improve sequentially, as I talked about, versus the 14% year-over-year decline we saw in Q3, okay? And that assumption was based off of the fact that we expect the transitory headwinds and one-offs in Q3 that would fall away, which would effectively bring our run rate growth to more of a high single-digit decline year-over-year. And then, on top of that, we expected savings to accelerate, leading to a significant sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, in the end, the transitory one-off factors did fall away as expected, but we had 3 negative impacts in the quarter that we didn't expect: first, we had roughly a 3.5 percentage point impact of unanticipated cost headwinds, which I can explain further; second, we didn't have the anticipated savings curve that we expected to materialize in the quarter to partially offset the inflation we're seeing; and then, finally, we did have an incremental FX drag of about 1.5 percentage points in Q4 versus Q3. So given all these factors, the year-on-year decline in Q4 is much closer than Q3, and we didn't see the sequential improvement. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to answer your other question."

Let me start from the -- answering the private label question and then we move to the 2019 pricing. Why we're seeing the private label expanding and it's doing so at a more -- we are seeing this happening at a more restrained pace, around 0.2 points of share in Q4. It was a material step down from previous quarters that we're seeing. And we are seeing the most pressure in areas where low commodities, excess capacity and retail competition come together, mostly now in some subsegments of our cheese portfolio. In natural cheese, we see also the retailers have used price matching to drive traffic and being able to invest back, that was part of our price investment we've had in the second half to narrow the price gaps. And after that, we saw branded and private label share starting to stabilize. So again, we're always monitoring the value proposition of the market and continue to innovate and differentiate our brands and products on that matter. When you think about 2019 pricing, we already have announced our pricing. We did an analysis in terms of to define the right part of the portfolio that we are pricing, being very conscious about the balance between sales and cost while still providing the best value equation and helping to drive category growth. And we are seeing, we already announced, this thing is going to take effect in Q1. And we expect overall -- our overall pricing to turn positive over the course of '19."

And I realize you've had a better top line lately, but one could argue, it took a $300 million spending infusion to get there. And I think, more importantly, you took a $15 billion write-down on 2 of your biggest brands, Kraft and Oscar Mayer. And to me, that literally means the brand equities there aren't what they used to be. So when investors are looking at the consistent financial disappointments at Kraft, maybe even bringing the eye into the discussion. And if they ask why -- if the 3G belt-tightening strategy goes too far and if it damages brands, is there at least some evidence starting to point to yes there?

We can say we have the right base to be growing, through consumption, volumes and share, at the same time, maintaining high leading margins to the industry. Into 2020, like David highlights to their alternate numbers, right, we do believe to that base, we are going to be in a very solid position to be growing top line and bottom line. Not only that, we are working more actively the portfolio. And now, with the reduction of the dividend, allows us to have more flexibility in our balance sheet to really deleverage faster and position ourselves to more consolidation in the future that we believe is necessary and will happen with that model.

So on the savings side, we were overly optimistic on our ability to offset significant inflation in the quarter. And again, that drove a significant part of the miss. So this savings miss was really a combination of 2 things, under-delivery from supplier negotiations and delayed manufacturing projects. And to give you a little bit of color on what some of those projects were like, they included line optimizations, yield improvements and assumed even better performance on some of our footprint plans that we discussed previously. So because of this miss, as Bernardo said, we took significant action to address our processes, planning and structure internally and simultaneously have spent a lot of time and focus really revisiting our savings projects and we replanned. As a function of that, our savings curve is being pushed out as we implement those changes, as we revisit our savings programs going forward.

With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where we did not and why. 
At this time last year, we set plans to drive profitable sales and consumption growth by investing in deployment of new capabilities and a strong pipeline of innovation and white space initiatives. And while we expected this to translate into near-term margin pressure in United States and Rest of the World segments, we anticipated stronger net savings to deliver constant currency EBITDA growth for the year. Overall, we successfully drove profitable sales and consumption growth accelerated, but we fell short in delivering the net savings we expect.
From a commercial perspective, we firmly restarted organic growth. In United States, our second half performance came back to offset the self-inflicted losses from the first half of the year. We became one of the few within our industry posting real volume-driven growth, growing volume/mix nearly 4%.
In Canada, similar to United States, we ended the year with positive consumption growth from improvements in coffee and cheese. Our EMEA business build momentum on the back of white space gains in condiments and encouraging share trends across our U.K. base. In Rest of the World, we are gaining traction in driving real growth with the startup of our new sauces plant in Brazil, and our Cerebos acquisition in Australia and New Zealand.
In our Foodservice business, on a global basis, is approaching $4 billion in sales and gaining momentum from white space initiatives in all markets. And this leads to the second aspect of our scorecard, the significant progress we made developing and deploying strategically advanced capabilities. We had strong returns on investment in marketing, category management and e-store sales. We continue to expand in e-commerce and reach, driving 79% channel growth in United States alone, and a 1/10 market share index versus traditional retail. In this setup, springboard and Evolv Ventures as platforms to accelerate our innovation to consumers, to customers and find new ways to disrupt ourselves.
So when you think about the sustainability of our growth, breakthrough innovation, strong in-store activity, distribution gain and white space expansion are all coming together. In fact, our consumption turnaround in United States has been driven by brand-building initiatives across the portfolio, not just a few categories. We are sustaining momentum in brands where we have been successful like Heinz, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer bacon, Classico, Kraft and our frozen and snack categories at large, all growing mid-single digits in 2018. Turning around other key brands like Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer hotdogs and A1, to low single-digit growth after several years of decline. Stabilizing historically challenged brands like Kraft salad dressing, mayo and our kids single-serve beverage business after years of mid-single-digit declines. And building new brands into meaningful platforms for growth, like P3, which now $120 million platform; Devour, a $7 million brand in less than 3 years; and Just Crack an Egg at $50 million after only 12 months. While some of this was supported by incremental promotion and price investments to improve consumption and distribution trends, we saw strong LOIs and created a solid base of support and commercial momentum for 2019. 
Where we fell short in 2018 was operations. Specifically, our entire EBITDA miss was driven by net savings versus expectations within our United States supply chain. To be fair, we must first recognize that our team operate at industry-leading levels globally; in quality, with top-tier performance in the industry; in safety, with our best results ever; and in customer service, achieving industry-leading case through rates and all-time in full delivery rates as we saw volumes ramp up. 
The core cause of our shortfall in 2018 was forecasting the pace and magnitude of our savings curve in 2018, not merger-related synergies and not an increase in ZBB costs. In fact, ZBB delivered savings across all fixed-cost package outside of our commercial investments and helped to fund our initiative.
To put our performance in context, we started 2018 expecting approximately 3% growth inflation, excluding key commodity costs, with savings programs expected to offset gross inflation. We ended the year with approximately 3% inflation, net of savings, specifically driven by higher supply chain costs and low operational savings in United States. There is no question we are disappointed that profitability did not ramp up with consumption gains as anticipated. We are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end. For that, we take full responsibility. And we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by touching planning process, procedures and organization structure.
In the end, we see 3 takeaways from 2018: one, we are successfully driving sustainable consumption growth; two, we have the ability to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins; and three, we need to better plan and execute our operational net savings initiatives.
Before we outline the 2019 plans, David will provide more details on our 2018 financials."

As we show on Slide 3, while our overall performance fell short of our expectations, the year-on-year drivers are straightforward. Consumption-driven growth, negatively impacted by cost inflation, net of savings in the U.S., with tax savings offsetting lower EBITDA, higher depreciation and interest expense.
From a trend perspective, there are a few important details to highlight. On the top line, consumption-driven growth momentum continued to build through Q4. For total Kraft Heinz, Q4 volume/mix growth was 4%, with growth in every reporting segment, driven by innovation, marketing, white space and go-to-market investments and led by improved consumption in a vast majority of U.S. categories. 
Total company Q4 pricing was down 160 basis points, including 80 basis points from key commodity pass-through in the U.S. Also note that the sequential decline in pricing versus Q3 was accentuated by a deceleration in contribution from price in our Rest of World segment.
And regarding U.S. pricing trends, as Bernardo mentioned, we were happy with the returns and results on this front. To provide more context and adjust for program timing, it's useful to understand the key drivers of U.S. pricing from a second half perspective. U.S. pricing in the second half of 2018 was down 2.4 percentage points, with 1 point from passing through lower key commodity costs. So U.S. pricing, net of key commodity impacts, was down 1.4% in the second half. Out of this, 40 basis points of the decline was primarily related to defending our natural cheese business by closing price gaps to private label. The remaining 1 point was a combination of opportunistic price investments and support of our innovation pipeline to stimulate incremental consumption with good lift and solid returns. Looking forward and excluding the impact of key commodity pass-through, we do not expect pricing to be down in 2019, either in the U.S. or globally.
Moving to EBITDA. We said on our last call that we expected our EBITDA growth rate to improve beginning in Q4. While this turned out directionally accurate, Q4 constant currency adjusted EBITDA was significantly below the expectations we previously outlined. As Bernardo mentioned, this was driven by shortfalls in the United States. To be more specific, while the one-off factors we outlined in Q3, by and large, fell away as expected, anticipated savings did not materialize, particularly in our procurement area and, to a lesser extent, we had higher-than-anticipated costs in both manufacturing and logistics.
Taken together, top line trends and bottom line results lead us to the key factors we considered over the past few months in finalizing our 2019 plans outlined on Slide 4, and I'll hand it back to Bernardo to start it off."

Our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged on several front, continued fragmentation of consumer demand, a general lack of affordability to reinvest in brands, retail competition where assortment is likely to grow in importance and, finally, in the short term, ongoing cost inflation. 
Given our savings shortfall and the high inflation we're seeing, we could focus on maintaining or expanding margins but risk forfeiting commercial growth and market share. By slowing our pace of innovation and channel development, focusing on marketing efficiency versus incremental marketing presence and compromising talent development at a critical time, we have not and we will not.
We are choosing to focus on improving our long-term growth trajectory and returns by driving consumption and market share; leveraging next-generation capabilities for brand and category advantage; and importantly, securing the right talent in areas critical to growth. In fact, in light of the industry backdrop, we have concluded that there is no better time for Kraft Heinz to improve our growth profile. 
And looking forward, we have set 3 objectives for 2019: first, leverage our industry-leading margins to sustain our commercial momentum; second, more actively manage our portfolio; and third, strengthen our balance sheet as we continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. I will cover our commercial growth initiatives, and David will outline our portfolio, capital restructure and financial expectations.
By far, the biggest and the best thing you can do to build the long-term value of our portfolio is to capture sustainable commercial growth by building on the sales momentum from 2018. And we have the stronger global pipeline we ever had to go after incremental consumer demand. In the United States, we'll be launching a record level of innovation, improving base consumption, velocities and leveraging brands and go-to-market investments. 
In Canada, the priority is reignite consumption in peanut butter as well as sauces and condiments. In Europe and Rest of the World markets, whitespace initiatives will focus on driving incremental sauces consumption and opening new geographies. And in Foodservice, all regions have significant opportunities to gain distribution and whitespace.
We will support these initiatives with fully funded brand programs, taking advantage of our superior media efficiency or cost per impression, and increasing our media effectiveness, our sales lift per impression by deploying new creative tools in digital marketing.
In a nutshell, we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had, backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged, category managed and go-to-market initiatives to win assortment and improve distribution across all channels, including e-commerce. And we plan to do this while we maintain industry-leading margins.
Now let me turn back to David as the remaining objectives are a big part of his 2019 goals."
278212,601900684,1674450,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2019",2019-02-21,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","I'll start with our financial expectations going forward on Slide 6.

Regarding top line, we are now well positioned to continue organic net sales growth, driven by incremental consumption gains. This will reflect volume/mix growth from innovation, distribution and whitespace initiatives and pricing actions that balance cost inflation and our market share objectives.
On pricing, note that we exited 2018 at strong levels of merchandising support and distribution. And price gaps are currently in a better place, so we do not expect pricing to be a drag year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. In fact, our U.S. business recently announced list price increases that are scheduled to take effect late in Q1.
From an organic growth perspective, in the very near term, Q1 is likely to decline versus the prior year due to unfavorable trade timing and a shift in Easter-related shipments to Q2 this year from Q1 last year, trade timing in Canada, comparisons with a very strong winter soup season in the U.K. and destocking in Asia Pacific. For the year, we are targeting positive organic net sales growth, with commercial gains partially offset by price elasticity. And on a nominal basis, a combination of currency headwinds and divestitures is likely to result in a 3 to 4-percentage-point headwind to net sales.
Regarding profitability, we fully expect to maintain industry-leading margins. At the same time, we think it's prudent to begin the year by properly level-setting expectations. To do so, as a one-off for 2019, we are breaking with our established guidance practices and setting a range for expected adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for this year. This includes commercial gains offset by stepped-up support of marketing, innovation, e-commerce and people; another year of low to mid-single-digit percentage non-key commodity inflation, net of cost savings; as well as foreign exchange rates and the 2 divestitures already announced.
In addition, we currently expect to begin 2019 with a first quarter that is likely to see a high-teens decline in adjusted EBITDA in percentage terms. We will be up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year, particularly in light of our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up commercial spending levels and with pricing not taking effect until late Q1.
Finally, at the EPS line, while we continue to believe that we can deliver top-tier growth, it will take hold from 2020 onwards. This is because in addition to our EBITDA outlook, 2019 will see approximately $0.25 of nonoperating headwinds versus 2018. This will come from a combination of several factors: $80 million of incremental depreciation expense; a roughly $120 million reduction in the other income line, mainly due to rising interest rates, increasing pension interest costs and less favorable market returns on planned assets assumed versus 2018; approximately $40 million of additional interest expense and a full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.
Taken together, top line, EBITDA and EPS drivers, while we expect to take a step backwards in 2019, we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards, driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands, cost structures and capabilities.
The rest of our plan is focused on how we can take additional steps to improve our portfolio's growth trajectory, strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves against inorganic opportunities. It starts with the potential for more active portfolio management, specifically through divestitures as a way to further improve our growth and returns as well as accelerate our deleveraging. 
The recent transactions we have announced, Indian beverages and Canada Natural Cheese, provide a good template of precedent for additional actions to exit areas with no clear path to competitive advantage and sell assets with strong valuations with some earnings dilution. We have now dedicated more resources, adding experience with Carlos Piani fully focused on our portfolio management efforts. And as we're able to execute such actions, we will look to deleverage with the proceeds, which leads to our next objective, further strengthening our balance sheet.
I think it's important to first recognize that we have the capacity to drive industry-leading cash generation along with industry-leading margins and expect to hold existing working capital and CapEx levels even as we drive the growth agenda we've outlined. In addition, given the industry backdrop and opportunities in front of us, we now see even greater strategic advantage in accelerating our deleveraging towards our ongoing 3x leverage target and strengthening the term structure of our debt. To do this, we're undertaking 2 specific actions: first, we intend to dedicate the divestiture proceeds from the sale of our India beverage and Canada Natural Cheese businesses to debt reduction. We also intend to do the same with proceeds from additional divestitures we are currently considering.
Second, today, we're announcing a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share or $1.60 per year, down from a rate of $2.50 per year. This will not only provide us greater balance sheet flexibility, it will also establish a base dividend that we can grow consistent with EBITDA growth over time. And we are comfortable that this level of dividend can accommodate the 2 divestitures we have already announced as well as those we are currently considering. These initiatives will accelerate the strengthening of an already solid balance sheet with a fully funded pension plan and continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bernardo to close."

Beginning in 2018 and into 2019, we'll focus on leveraging our industry-leading margins to establish key growth pillars through innovation and whitespace expansion, accelerate the global deployment of advantage capabilities across all channels and geographies and now more actively managing our portfolio for better growth and returns. From 2020, we expect to see growth on both the top and bottom lines, as the full leverage of our advantage brands, cost structure and investments flows to the P&L.

So let me step back for a second and I can break down our 2019 outlook a bit more and get a sense for our EBITDA expectations year-over-year. So overall, we expect gains from consumption growth to be in line with the stepped-up spending behind our initiatives. So really, the main drivers for the expected EBITDA decline year-over-year are a few factors: first, the net inflation that we talked about that we expect to see again in 2019; the divestitures I talked about; FX; and to a lesser extent, variable compensation. So to be more specific, if you assume the midpoint of our range or a roughly $700 million decline year-over-year, let me elaborate on the 4 main drivers behind that. So first off, on the commercial side, again, we should be neutral on the bottom line as we expect the positive contribution from further consumption gains to be in line with the stepped-up investments as we accelerate the pace of our innovation, base business performance and channel development; second, beyond that, roughly half of the total EBITDA decline or roughly $300 million to $400 million is driven by continued inflation, net of cost savings, in the low to mid-single-digit range, consistent with what we saw in 2018. So this will be driven by another year of mid-single-digit growth -- low to mid-single-digit growth inflation, excluding key commodities. And given the recent experience, actions we've taken to replan the savings and pushing out the savings curve. Third, we expect the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the divestitures we've already announced, that should drive another $250 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA versus 2018. And then, finally, we have an impact from variable compensation, which is another roughly $80 million year-over-year. So taken together, this will put us where we still have the highest margin in the industry, and we believe that is the right base to build from. So to elaborate more on why we're confident even with the miss in expectations that we saw in Q4 and the decline in EBITDA that we're seeing in 2019, let me elaborate a little bit on why we're so confident in 2020. First, on the top line, we should be very well positioned for solid organic growth globally, okay? We're already seeing real consumption-driven growth in the U.S. and globally today that we're able to create in the second half of 2018. And in 2019, we expect to further improve our consumption rate behind the largest innovation pipeline that we've ever had and more support on the core business. And we have a rapidly growing international business with significant exposure to emerging markets and whitespace opportunities to accelerate that growth globally. At EBITDA, in 2019, we are spending ahead to support an even larger innovation pipeline that I mentioned and accelerating channel development, particularly in e-commerce. So the right spending in commercial support levels, capabilities and marketing will have been established this year in 2019. And then, on the cost side, the extraordinary inflation that we're seeing in 2018 and that we're now seeing in 2019 from things like tariffs and transportation should mitigate over time as we're starting to see in the spot markets today. And we're also confident that we will be able to -- we'll be in a much stronger position to manage those costs through pricing and our savings curve going forward in 2020. And finally, at EPS, our nonoperating below-the-line cost that I talked about should be at run rate levels, so that we can leverage the organic growth into both EBITDA and EPS growth 2020 going forward."

So again, let me step back for a second and kind of walk through our Q4 performance versus our original expectations to provide a little more context, and then I'll hand it over to Bernardo to provide a little more color on what we're doing differently to make sure this doesn't happen. On the Q3 call, we did expect Q4 EBITDA growth to improve sequentially, as I talked about, versus the 14% year-over-year decline we saw in Q3, okay? And that assumption was based off of the fact that we expect the transitory headwinds and one-offs in Q3 that would fall away, which would effectively bring our run rate growth to more of a high single-digit decline year-over-year. And then, on top of that, we expected savings to accelerate, leading to a significant sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, in the end, the transitory one-off factors did fall away as expected, but we had 3 negative impacts in the quarter that we didn't expect: first, we had roughly a 3.5 percentage point impact of unanticipated cost headwinds, which I can explain further; second, we didn't have the anticipated savings curve that we expected to materialize in the quarter to partially offset the inflation we're seeing; and then, finally, we did have an incremental FX drag of about 1.5 percentage points in Q4 versus Q3. So given all these factors, the year-on-year decline in Q4 is much closer than Q3, and we didn't see the sequential improvement. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to answer your other question."

And to put into context, that compares to our overall procurement spend of over $11 billion, which excludes big 4 commodities spend.

Let me start from the -- answering the private label question and then we move to the 2019 pricing. Why we're seeing the private label expanding and it's doing so at a more -- we are seeing this happening at a more restrained pace, around 0.2 points of share in Q4. It was a material step down from previous quarters that we're seeing. And we are seeing the most pressure in areas where low commodities, excess capacity and retail competition come together, mostly now in some subsegments of our cheese portfolio. In natural cheese, we see also the retailers have used price matching to drive traffic and being able to invest back, that was part of our price investment we've had in the second half to narrow the price gaps. And after that, we saw branded and private label share starting to stabilize. So again, we're always monitoring the value proposition of the market and continue to innovate and differentiate our brands and products on that matter. When you think about 2019 pricing, we already have announced our pricing. We did an analysis in terms of to define the right part of the portfolio that we are pricing, being very conscious about the balance between sales and cost while still providing the best value equation and helping to drive category growth. And we are seeing, we already announced, this thing is going to take effect in Q1. And we expect overall -- our overall pricing to turn positive over the course of '19."

We can say we have the right base to be growing, through consumption, volumes and share, at the same time, maintaining high leading margins to the industry. Into 2020, like David highlights to their alternate numbers, right, we do believe to that base, we are going to be in a very solid position to be growing top line and bottom line.

And to give you a little bit of color on what some of those projects were like, they included line optimizations, yield improvements and assumed even better performance on some of our footprint plans that we discussed previously. So because of this miss, as Bernardo said, we took significant action to address our processes, planning and structure internally and simultaneously have spent a lot of time and focus really revisiting our savings projects and we replanned.

In that sense, I think even with the miss in U.S. operations, we still have the base of the margin here that allows us from this base to build 2020 and beyond and the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation for us to be a consolidator if the industry goes our way."

Well, first of all, I'm honored to be with you today as the new CEO of Kraft Heinz. As someone who has worked on some of the biggest brands in the world, I know intimately they are powered in the marketplace and with consumers. Kraft Heinz has some of the globe's best roughly 200 brands in nearly 200 countries with nearly 20 of them maintaining the relevance for 100 years or more. We are in 97% of American households today, holding the #1 or 2 spots in 50 categories. 
And I'm humbled to follow the great CEOs that have successfully adapted our brands and businesses through periods of tremendous change over more than 100 years. These are great assets for any business, but at Kraft Heinz, we have far bigger aspirations. That's why I wanted to be candid with you from the start of my tenure here. The valuation of our stock is now among the lowest in the industry, and you deserve straight talk from me about how this business is run. I promise that to you today and for as long as I'm here. 
The entire Board has mandated a new approach to Kraft Heinz. As such, it's my job to tell you what we got wrong and why we got it wrong. Over the coming months, I will share more with you about how we'll fix it, but it starts right now with me and our entire senior management team. Our brands are icons. It's our job to ensure they are living icons.
To do that, we must understand the future so we can lead, not follow. We must understand the consumer better than any other company. We have a good start on being data and process driven, but we must put more attention on deep consumers insights. For instance, we have sophisticated tools to tell quality impressions versus those that don't reach the consumer. But we are also the company that had the first plant-based burger, the Boca Burger, combat find ourselves far behind the plant-based market today. 
Many of you believe our story as one of cost control and zero-based budgeting. These have been strengths for our company because they have enhanced our margins since the time of our merger. Without this discipline, we would be in a worse place today. But we have to do more than that. We need to change so we can apply strong, consistent investments in our brands. 
There is no doubt our industry is in such a big moment of transformation in retail, nontraditional channels, private label, premiumization, consumer values, health and well-being. Big transformation represents big opportunity, and we as an organization need to be at the forefront of this change. 
My first 40 days at Kraft Heinz have been rich in learning with honest and candid conversations with our global leaders, employees as well as our customers. I've held numerous town halls, had one-on one with more than 300 employees and had the chance to visit all of our major offices around the world. Those conversations have left me with an enormous appreciation for the team that we have here at Kraft Heinz. Our team is hard-working and motivated to drive the next chapter of the business. And the consistent message I hear from them is that while they've been through a lot, they still have a strong desire to win. Their commitment to the company is why I'm privileged to be their leader. 
But before we get into my first impressions and thoughts on our path forward, I'm going to ask David to review our first half results."

First off, with the filing of forms 10-Q for both the first and second quarters, we expect to regain our current filer status with the SEC. 
The accounting review and audit process for our 10-K was a thorough and time-intensive effort, and we restated past periods for misstatements that have occurred over the past 4 fiscal years. Overall, the magnitude of adjustments to our historical numbers was a cumulative impact from 2015 to 2018 of less than 1% of net income. We are now taking extensive actions to improve internal policies and procedures and to strengthen internal controls, including over financial reporting. To date, we have already implemented a comprehensive disciplinary plan for all employees found to have engaged in this conduct. 
Enhance our organization, augmenting our procurement finance teams with additional experienced professionals in the area of supplier contracts and related arrangements as well as realigned reporting lines so procurement finance now reports directly to the finance organization. And have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls for financial reporting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed. 
We're also in the process of reassessing employees' KPIs and will be implementing checkpoints to evaluate the impacts from significant changes in the environment as well as evaluating potential solutions to upgrade our procurement management software and deploying a comprehensive global procurement training program. 
Taking these steps to improve internal controls is of the utmost importance for our Board, Miguel and myself. It will continue to be a high priority for the organization going forward, and I would like to thank all parties for their support and dedication, especially our finance and legal teams, our Board of Directors, our financial partners, among others. 
Regarding our first half performance, overall, while our consumption and share trends continue to improve, our first half results were held back by actions at a number of our retail partners in both the U.S. and Canada to reduce the amount of inventory they carry. We continue to suffer from higher supply chain costs, and frankly, the absolute level of year-on-year declines in EBITDA and EPS are simply unacceptable. 
If you recall, in February, we set out priorities around improving our growth and returns by driving consumption and market share and leveraging in-store sales and e-commerce investments to build our brands and grow our categories. So far, this year, our retail takeaway in both the United States and Canada has continued to grow and improve since the second half of 2018 and into the first half of 2019. 
In the United States, first half consumption in measured channels was up 1.1% versus the prior year with market share gains in more than half of our business. In Canada, retail sales consumption grew nearly 4% in the first half, although this was aided by a return to a more normal promotional calendar versus the prior year. And we've continued our strong push on condiments and sauces around the world with significant advertising and merchandising activity behind the Heinz 150-year anniversary. But on the whole, we are dissatisfied with our financial performance year-to-date as well as the fact that retailer inventory reductions dampened our potential for the first half and the full year.
In terms of sales for the first half, we outlined in February the sources of our organic net sales decline. These included unfavorable promotional timing in both the United States and Canada as well as difficult comparisons versus an exceptionally strong prior year in U.K. soups. In addition to that, we also saw a negative impact from lower inventory levels at retail in North America that we did not anticipate as well as lost sales due to trade negotiations in parts of Continental Europe as we implemented good, better, best pricing in ketchup between our Heinz and newly repatriated Kraft brands.
From a total company perspective, organic net sales were down 1.5% in the first half, including an adverse impact of approximately 1.2 percentage points from retail inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Volume mix was relatively flat in the first half as the reduction in retail inventory levels more than offset consumption growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Pricing was negative, down 1.3 percentage points, driven by 3 factors. The first factor driving lower pricing was unfavorable timing of promotional expense, representing a roughly 80 basis point decrease in price on a global basis, including approximately 90 basis points in the U.S. In the U.S., while we expected promotional timing to be a source of year-over-year decline in the first half, it should turn favorable in the second half of the year and, therefore, relatively neutral for the full year. By contrast, the step-up in Canada reflects greater activity versus last year, including the Natural Cheese business that we just sold and is not likely to reverse in the second half. 
The second factor was key commodity-driven pricing in North America, representing a roughly 30 basis point drag on global pricing in the first half. And third, the remainder primarily reflects continued promotional support behind select U.S. categories, mainly in our Lunchables and frozen categories. 
With respect to profitability, we spoke about our first quarter and, indeed, our first half being up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year. This reflected our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up fixed cost investments and retail channel growth, marketing and our people as well as pricing not beginning to take effect until the second quarter. In the end, the cost inflation picture, while improving, remains unfavorable versus the prior year across packaging, manufacturing and logistics in the United States. And this, together with stepped-up fixed cost investments, drove roughly half of the constant currency production and first half EBITDA we saw versus the prior year. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, the decline we saw in the first half reflected lower adjusted EBITDA as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses versus the prior year period. Other income and our effective tax rate versus the first half of 2018 were more favorable than we expected such that in total, the loan [indiscernible] items were a $0.02 benefit to adjusted EPS versus the first 6 months of 2018. 
From a forward-looking perspective, we have now completed the 2 divestitures we previously announced, India Nutritional Beverages and Canada Natural Cheese. These divestitures resulted in a combined the after-tax proceeds of more than $1.5 billion, and we remain committed to using those proceeds to further deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet. However, I will highlight here that with regard to our effective tax rate, we continue to expect roughly 21% for the full year. The first half was only 18.4% due to the timing of discrete items, but this benefit is not expected to repeat, resulting in a higher rate in the second half, especially in Q3. And for the second half of 2019 specifically, we continue to expect to see an improvement in year-over-year top and bottom line growth rates versus what we saw in the first half. This should be driven by continued momentum in consumer uptake and more innovation coming to market; improved pricing trends, particularly as our price increases in the U.S. take hold; and lapping some of the stepped-up fixed costs and cost inflation that we saw in the back half of last year, although I would note that we are seeing risk from further reductions in retail or inventory levels as well as accelerating key commodity costs in the U.S. that we had not anticipated at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back to Miguel."

I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point,",1555,"Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point, I think it's important to make a candid assessment of where I think we are today.
At the outset, I shared many of the concerns that a good number of you have expressed over things like brand support, supply chain execution, the sustainability of our profits and just how long it would take to be in the position to start growing both the top line and the bottom lines. And now our Board of Directors made it clear that they wanted to bring change in light of the company's recent missteps and have given me their full support to contemplate any path that will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. So far, I have found, as you might expect, things are rarely as bad or as good as what you read from the outside. What is clear is that we win when we strongly and consistently invest in our brands. For instance, thanks to innovations and investments to extend a 150-year-old brand into new segments, Heinz achieved an all-time high market share in U.S. ketchup, reaching [ 70% ] in the second quarter. And Philadelphia has consistently grown share and grown the category year-over-year since 2014 with a 68% share year-to-date by setting the standard for superior quality and taste.
We have also built a world-class quality organization that has had the fewest recalls in the food industry over the past 4 years. Since 2015, we invested more than $1 billion of CapEx in North America alone, including significant investments on the end of the line for detection, risk avoidance and consumer complaint mitigation. These are just some examples of great things I've seen at the company in my early days. But it's also important to face the cold, hard facts and assess where we have had shortfalls. 
First and foremost, the company had a significant decline in adjusted EBITDA margins from a peak of 29.4% in the fiscal 2017 to roughly 24.5% for the trailing 12 months through the end of June this year. This was driven by a combination of inflation in our supply chain, including packaging freight over time and maintenance costs as well as significant step-up in fixed costs to support sales growth with price increases lagging higher costs.
Regarding our supply chain problems in 2018, it's clear we lost forecast accuracy and our ability to execute productivity initiatives to offset market inflation. I believe we persisted with integration-minded cost cutting and did not pivot to a continuous improvement productivity-driven mindset soon enough. Before I arrived, the company started to take actions to make sure this doesn't happen again, but I see opportunity to go further by bringing in more technical expertise in critical areas, by improving collaboration and process between our category and supply chain teams, by doing a better job of understanding root causes of supply chain losses. And this needs to be supported by our finance team, leading a cross-functional effort to improve visibility. 
So one of my main priorities now and going forward is to make sure we have a much better visibility in our supply chain as well as more robust ongoing productivity initiatives. I believe this critical part of the company should and can generate significant productivity. If we have the proper visibility, we can build a solid pipeline of efficiencies-oriented initiatives across our value chain.
Moving to our fixed costs or SG&A. Since 2015, we have taken out significant costs from the business. We also reinvested roughly $300 million last year in areas like people, go-to-market capabilities, marketing and innovation. To be honest, it's too early for me to tell which investments will generate the returns we expect, but my experience tells me that whenever there are a lot of big investments in such a short period of time, it's difficult to see all of them working at once. It's therefore critical that we prioritize the ones that are working and that fit the strategic agenda that we are currently developing. And for the investments that are not working, we move those dollars to areas that may need more investment. As examples, I believe our investments in media remain low despite fixed costs and overall marketing spend increasing over the past 2 years. 
On the brand and innovation side, we need to become more consumer obsessed so we can better predict their behavior even before they know it. There are practices that need to change in the product development process so we can be faster and more consumer centric with our new products. And we need to better balance spending on marketing innovations versus core brand support. 
And in terms of retail channel development, Kraft Heinz has grown rapidly and has had strong share performance in e-commerce that we really need to take a step back and develop a longer-term outlook of the channel growth and how Kraft Heinz can win and assess the incrementality of each customer.
So it's not just about cutting costs. It's becoming more about efficiency and making dollars already in our base work harder elsewhere. 
Let me turn now to my priorities and the opportunities I see ahead of us. When I became CEO last month, I established 3 immediate goals with the Board. The first, which should be obvious, is to get to know our business, our consumers, our customers and my colleagues. The second is to execute our existing 2019 business plan. And the third and most important is to lead a comprehensive review to develop a new strategic agenda for the next 3 to 5 years. It is critical that we get the organization to concentrate on setting our strategic direction and laying the foundation for our future now. We need to ask ourselves the hard questions about our business, not thinking about the short term or next quarter. And we need to take the time to seek out external and internal inspiration and build on best practices, both within Kraft Heinz and from other world-class brands. 
From a financial perspective, we do expect many of the top and bottom line factors that held back the first half to [ fade ] in the second half. But I've asked David that we not provide or update specific point estimate financial guidance. Setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities. In addition, as I'm learning the business and develop our strategic agenda, I want us to spend more time evaluating the questions of divestures. We absolutely remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating, but our more urgent priority is to get the organization fixated on our consumers and customers and, in this process, ensure we don't rush to give away potential value to others. We have already started the work and taken some early actions to put in place the right team and the right structure to help achieve  my 3 immediate priorities. 
As you may have seen, my first act as CEO was to make some changes in our structure to help accelerate our progress. First, I have taken on the U.S. president role on an interim basis. U.S. represents 70% of our company, and this will help me understand our business, consumers and the customers faster. For me, this deep dive is an essential step to developing the right plan that drives sustainable growth and shareholder value for Kraft Heinz. I also established a new role, international zone president for Kraft Heinz, combining our EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American zones, representing 20% of our global business. We did this to create a streamlined, more robust international structure to find commonalities, define their strategy and drive the business with greater speed.
We will continue to share more of our approach to the strategic agenda over the coming quarters. We expect to complete our work by the year-end and anticipate sharing our conclusions with you early next year.
As we do with this plan, my experience has shown that to truly change the momentum of a business, we must understand the future, identifying where the consumer, their needs and the marketplace are headed and then invest quickly and consistently to make sure our core brands will serve those needs better than the competition. Further, I believe we can and must find internal efficiencies, whether in our supply chain or fixed cost base that have both increased substantially in the last 2 years, that can help to fund this strategy. 
Intense discipline is a virtue, but it's not an end in itself. I believe great companies are the ones that keep expenses under control so they can use the capital for new investments that grow both the top line and the bottom line. It's not one or the other. And as I look ahead, I'm very excited about the opportunities at Kraft Heinz. Similar to my attention to consumers, customers and colleagues, I also look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and quarters. 
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

I really believe on the power of brands, and I think that we have an amazing portfolio of brands. Some are shiny, some are not. But I think the heritage that we have in the brand, the household penetration that we have, the awareness that we have makes me feel very positive about the possibility of turning on some of the trends that we have in the brands that are not doing as well. I also think that we have a great scale, and that is a big competitive advantage in America. And I'm also very, very excited about the possibility of turning the business around. I've done it before in my life, and I think that it is possible. 
Now to turn the business around, I think it's critical that we define comprehensive strategy, and this strategy has to be based on understanding the future, understanding the consumer. I believe that if we -- that the industry is in a huge transformation today, and transformation is also a moment of opportunity. And the ones that are going to take this opportunity are the ones that will understand the future better than the others, so then we'll lead. The ones that will not understand will follow, and the followers will not win. So we need, again, steps, a comprehensive simple strategy for the future and be very disciplined on making and executing it. So I'm very excited. I'm much more excited today after 40 days than I was on day 1 about our future."

Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest much more, especially in our people and our brands.

Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest much more, especially in our people and our brands. I think that, as I said before, that our media investments are below where they should be. But before going after new investments, I would really look at the possibility of inefficiencies in the system so I can reorganize and redeploy these investments. I'm still -- of course, it's early to talk about it, but I'm seeing a lot of inefficiencies, and these for me are big opportunities. 
I'll give you just 2 examples so I'm not so theoretical. In marketing, we increased investments in the last 2 years, but in media, we've been declining. We grew investments or we put money behind many other things, agency fees, production, research, product development. But the things that the consumer really sees, we declined to pay the other expense. These for me are inefficiencies that we can redeploy. 
I'll give you another example. Maybe because of all the complexity that we put in the system, our supply chain losses have been increasing, actually, double digits in the last years. That's not acceptable. We need to understand very well the root causes of these supply chain losses, and that's to reduce them These are losses that can be converted to investments. So those are 2 examples of inefficiencies that I see very early here in my job and this has to be my focus. Before talking about new investments and reducing the margin, I would -- I'm going after inefficiencies that I can put back in the system to feed the growth, and I'm seeing that."

I'm just trying to get a sense of whether timing or expense or something to understand those factors, those items that are kind of missing at Kraft Heinz today that how long are we talking. How much do you think it will cost to get the company to the point where you think you have the visibility you need and the process in place to better grow the business?"

I think that when you put 2 companies together, the first cycle or first phase or the first cycle has to be really about bringing in new culture and extracting inefficiencies. And I think",317,"Okay. So Chris, let me go back a little bit in time at Kraft Heinz. I think that when you put 2 companies together, the first cycle or first phase or the first cycle has to be really about bringing in new culture and extracting inefficiencies. And I think that the company did a good job on that. We extracted a lot of efficiencies. We cut a lot of costs. But then after 2 years, it's hard to continue cutting costs. You need to change the strategy or you need to change the path. In the first year, you have 2 CEOs. You cut 1 CEO, that's a cost cutting. But the following year, you don't have another CEO to cut. Cost cutting is a one-off activity and is necessary when you have the opportunity. But then  you have to move, and you have to think about how do we reduce costs but in a different way. And that way is, really, you have to change the way of operating the business. It's about efficiencies. It's about making better every day forever. You need to change the mindset. And if you continue cutting costs, you can get in trouble. 
I think that this second phase starts now with me. Yes, it could have started before. And I think the company would have benefit from that, but it didn't. And so it's time now with me, and I'm going to put a big emphasis on that. Not on cost cutting, but on efficiencies in the system; extracting inefficiencies from the system; making better every day; making our factories much more efficient, making our execution in sales much better; making our market investments, as I mentioned before, much better as well, so we invest on things that the consumers see, not what the consumer doesn't see, et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question, Chris."

So like Miguel said, we're not providing guidance, but I can give some additional color on some of the items below the line. 
So we continue to expect up to $0.25 of unfavorability below our adjusted EBITDA line for the full year relative to 2018, and this negative impact will be greater in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half for a couple of different reasons. First off, the largest driver is tax. We have some discrete benefits in the first half, whereas we expect some discrete costs within the back half of the year. Second, we did see some FX favorability in the first half in other income that may flip in the second half. Third, related to incentive-based comp, we'll have a significant expense in the second half of the year, and this is due to the timing of the delayed filings of our 10-K and our 10-Qs. We typically expect that to happen in the first half of the full year. And then finally, we may see some higher interest expense in the second half as well."

I want to go further a little bit and tell you why. 
I think that first, because I believe that for Kraft Heinz, now we need -- what we don't need is to be focused on internal -- on product targets on the short term. We have a big agenda to build. We have a second half to deliver. 
But I think that working on structure and targets will not help. But second, since I've been here just for 40 days, I wouldn't feel comfortable about give a guidance that I still do not have the necessary confidence about that number. I'm not sure if I'm going to overachieve by second half, if I'm going to underachieve or I will achieve. When in this situation, when managers look at the leaders always with empty pockets, right? Like they don't know me yet. But what I know is that in the second half, some of the pressures that we had in the first half will fade, pressures like supply costs or even commercial costs. And that is positive. However, there's also risks and risks such as further retailer inventory reductions, commodity inflation in categories where private label has had a lot of success like natural cheese, meat and coffee. But one observation that I can -- that I made early on is that from a seasonality standpoint, historically, Kraft Heinz usually earns 50% of the 50 -- at least 50% of the EBITDA in the first half of the year, but that's just an observation. So we'll see how we do."

So that's right that we're not abiding guidance for the full year. So we're pulling guidance. But I can't provide a little bit of color on our expectations for the full year without giving enough data point estimate for sales or EBITDA. So like I said before, we do expect to see better year-on-year performance on top and bottom line in the second half versus the first half. And some of the drivers are what's consistent with what we said in February, and there's some new potential risks to that as well. So what hasn't changed this is our expectations in February are continued retail take away that we've seen in the market with U.S. consumption up 1%, Canada consumption up 4% and that we expect to continue to be supported by accelerated innovation in the back half. And we've also seen some promising growth globally in our Foodservice business as well. 
On top of that, we expect to see improved pricing trends in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half, and this will happen with some of the trade timing that we're lapping as well as the price increases in the U.S. that we implemented later in the first half that we'll fully lap in the second half as well. 
And then finally, on the positive side, as Miguel mentioned earlier, we do expect to see improving cost inflation as we start to lap some of the higher costs that we had in the second half of 2018. 
What has changed versus our expectations in February, and as we progress through Q2, is we do see risks for further retail inventory reductions in the second half, although we can't say what that may look like. We do see additional risk. And on top of that, we also see risk from accelerating key commodity inflation, particularly in the U.S. in meats and dairy, that we'll definitely try to meet and manage via price but could be a risk to us in the second half.

We need to find opportunities; find white spaces; what [ places ] to invest; what channel today that we have lower share; what channels to divest more and structure for growth; what countries where we should attack and grow, invest on. And this will all be part of a strategy for growth. 
So examples, I was talking here with my colleagues that a country that I know very well, China. China, we have a very good business on soy sauce. We are [indiscernible] 2 of the provinces, [indiscernible]. They're 2 of the most -- the richest provinces. We are there. It's a business or it's an industry, so it's an industry of $12 billion. It grows 8% per year, and we have great [indiscernible]. But they are just in 2 provinces. Big opportunities grow outside of this processes. There's big opportunity to have other sauces, not only soy sauce. Why haven't we done it? I do know exactly. But I see as big opportunity, it's a whitespace that we have to organize ourselves for growth. 
It's also been [indiscernible] mindset that we have to do it and to fund and have to work on the other side to fund these growth initiatives. Where we have to be very efficient. We have to be more efficient than everybody else. And to tell you the truth, when I came and when arrived here, I was absolutely sure that I would find this opportunities for growth. I was not sure if we had the opportunities for efficiencies because I didn't know the business; and I -- today, I know that we have. But there are many other white spaces like talking about ethnicities. 20% of the population in America are Hispanics and represents 40% of the growth of the population. We don't have absolutely anything in our portfolio today to attend this population. We don't even communicate to the Hispanic community. That is an opportunity. So I'm looking at these opportunities everywhere from a brand standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from an ethnicity standpoint, from a country standpoint.

I think it was $300 million in some levels of brand support. You've said that there's some inefficiencies there. But as far as the return on that investment and return on any investment you're making in marketing your brands in categories you're in, do you feel like there are enough microcosms or individual success stories that you can build upon here? And what would those be? Because I think there's a lot of questions about return on any marketing investment in some of the categories that you're in."

And I would say the same here, in front of me, I have here reports from Nielsen with 21 categories. 13 of them had positive shares in the first half of the year. So who's argue with you that some of -- there are a lot of investments that are working. I would mention Heinz Ketchup with innovation that we had and the communication is a very good example, innovation to premiumize the brand, launching organic version, no added sugar, that we can charge more that have higher margin. And that helps us well the image of the brand. And that is a very good example of what to do. We put more money behind the brand, and we achieve all-time share, achieving 70% share. That's a good example. So -- but on the other hand again, as I said, I think we can do a much better job on focus on investments on core brands, not dilute at among a lot of brands and small brands, do more innovation on big brands instead of launching too many new brands, having innovation that is more incremental and not dilutive. I think we did a lot of that extension but not enough of a creative innovation. So there's the big homework to be done in marketing. I don't think everything is wrong at all. I think there are a lot of good examples. But we can do better and consistently invest in our brands."

And I would even say that above pricing, revenue management overall. Specifically, on pricing, I think that on categories that we need, we need to meet the pricing on maybe in the past, they took us too much time to press inflation, I have suffered with that. I also think that pricing average on pricing are dangers because we have brands like Heinz Ketchup or like Philadelphia that industrial innovation or not innovation have, we've be enable to pass price. And we continue growing, and we're achieving all-time highs in market share. But of course, we have more pressure on categories where we have more competition from private label and where more driven by commodities like cheese. 
So David mentioned before that yes, one of the risks we have in the second half is because cheese, the commodity of cheese is increasing dramatically, the price of cheese. And we have asking prices. And they are expecting private label to follow, but we don't know. We don't know if that's a risk. So that would be my comments on pricing. 
But I would like to go beyond. I think opportunities in revenue management exist as well. I think we could do a better job of -- to maximize the discounts. Discount is a big investment. And I think we can do much better on allocating discounts, of accounts, by product throughout the year and understand better what works and what we when and how. And I also think that innovation can play a big role on revenue management and, as a consequence, on pricing. I think there are good opportunities in this area that I want to explore moving forward."

So on the impairment side, first off, our impairment testing, as you know, occurs in Q2 every year. And so we performed our testing procedures this year after we filed the 10-K concurrent with preparing our Q1 and Q2 financial statements. And to reiterate, these are preliminary numbers that we disclosed in the 8-K. 
So the preliminary impairment charges in the first half were driven by 2 main factors. So first off, as you said, we did have revised expectations in response to current market factors in some of our international businesses that were evaluated during the first quarter of 2019 as we develop these 5-year plans. And as a reminder, these are the reporting units, [indiscernible] reporting units in Brazil where we had an impairment.
Secondly, we also had the application of a higher discount rate to reflect the sustained decline in our stock price since the start of the year. And so also, we should keep in mind that we did start the year with nearly $60 billion of goodwill and definite life intangibles with less than 20% cushion relative to their carrying value. So what that means as there's going to be continued risk of future impairments given any change in forecast or modeling assumption can particularly trigger that. And to answer your question specifically. As we kind of updated and develop these operating forecasts, we did have lower revenue and margin expectations, specifically for the 3 reporting units that I mentioned, EMEA, East, Brazil and [indiscernible]. The 6 brands that were impaired with in Q2 were driven by the increased discount rate, which again was reflecting the sustained reduction in our stock price since the start of the year."

Steve, look, we'll update you throughout -- or through the rest of the year on how strategic work is going, but it's our intention to share with our Board at the end of the year and then sharing with you at the beginning of next year. 
Now talking a little bit about my experience with food and how this can be adapted to food. I think there are lot of similarities, but there are a lot of differences as well. And I think this has been actually pretty good, arriving here with fresh eyes and asking questions that some were obvious but people were not asking themselves for a long time. Some were not obvious, and they had not been asked about it before. And so this has been positive. I think that my experience in the past, both from leading global brands at AVI and using premiumization as a way to grow top line, were very interesting. When I was Head of Marketing, AVI has been growing substantially because of mix, because of premium brands, and I think this is an opportunity in the food industry. There is a big premiumization going on, but the premiumization actually is coming much more from the small players, not from the big food players. 
But let me share with you another experience from my past that, I think, we can adapt here in -- at Kraft Heinz. I ran our business in Asia, and China has been the best stories of organic growth for AVI. And the reason why we succeeded was because we understood the future of business in China better than anybody else. And we understood that the economic growth would bring huge premiumization, wealth, the channels would change, channels would grow immensely. And so we'd make all the best in the future. We'd make all the best in what would grow, not what's big necessarily. And that happened. And making that parallel with Kraft Heinz, I think this is critical for us. Yes, we need to navigate through the present, but we need to give a strategy for the future. We need to define where this business is going to grow, where food is going to grow and be ahead of everybody else. In terms of China, we understood that much better even than the local brewers. We understood China better than them. And I think that, again, this what I was talking about the future before. If we understand the future and we lead the future, we're going to win. And the ones that will not understand will just follow. And I really want to be in the first group, not in the second group.
And so -- and as I said before, there's big transformation in food. Negative people will be afraid of that. I'm an optimistic by nature, and I believe that this transformation is an area of big opportunity and the ones that will understand the future are the ones that are going to win, and we'll be those. 
Well, this was the last question. I just would like to finish just by saying a couple of words maybe from arriving a little bit of what we talked during this call. I wanted to tell you, to reinforce how excited and delighted I am with the opportunity to take Kraft Heinz to the next level. I am, the way that you are, disappointed with the first half results, but I'm determined to rebuild our business momentum. I have our Board's support, and not only support, expectation to set a new direction, a new forward. And for me, there are no sacred [ cows ], no preconceived ideas, just fresh eyes and just thinking about what is best for our great company. I know there's a lot of headwinds, but I see also encouraging solid consumption trends that are very positive. But we much continue to work our portfolio, our strategy and invest strategically to put ourselves in a position for top line and bottom line growth. We need to improve our speed. We need to become absolutely obsessed with the consumer and understanding the future better than anybody else. We need to pivot from a cost-cutting mentality to a continuous improvement, efficiency focus. And we need to strengthen the balance sheet. That remains a priority.
So thank you very much for your time. I'm delighted to be here with you today and really looking forward to knowing you personally and to be sharing my views and to be learning from you as well. Thank you very much."

Well, first of all, I'm honored to be with you today as the new CEO of Kraft Heinz. As someone who has worked on some of the biggest brands in the world, I know intimately they have power in the marketplace and with consumers. Kraft Heinz has some of the globe's best roughly 200 brands in nearly 200 countries, with nearly 20 of them maintaining their relevance for 100 years or more. We are in 97% of American households today, holding the #1 or 2 spots in 50 categories. 
And I'm humbled to follow the great CEOs that have successfully adapted our brands and businesses through periods of tremendous change over more than 100 years. These are great assets for any business, but at Kraft Heinz, we have far bigger aspirations. That's why I wanted to be candid with you from the start of my tenure here. The valuation of our stock is now among the lowest in the industry, and you deserve straight talk from me about how this business is run. I promise that to you today and for as long as I'm here. 
The entire Board has mandated a new approach to Kraft Heinz. As such, it's my job to tell you what we got wrong and why we got it wrong. Over the coming months, I will share more with you about how we'll fix it, but it starts right now with me and our entire senior management team. Our brands are icons, it's our job to ensure they are living icons.
To do that, we must understand the future so we can lead, not follow. We must understand the consumer better than any other company. We have a good start on being data and process-driven, but we must put more attention on deep consumer insights. For instance, we have sophisticated tools to tell quality-made  impressions versus those that don't reach the consumer. But we are also the company that had the first plant-based burger, the Boca Burger, but find ourselves far behind the plant-based market today. 
Many of you believe our story as one of cost control and zero-based budgeting. These have been strengths for our company because they have enhanced our margins since the time of our merger. Without this discipline, we would be in a worse place today. But we have to do more than that. We need to change so we can apply strong, consistent investment in our brands. 
There is no doubt our industry is in such a big moment of transformation in retail, nontraditional channels, private label, premiumization, consumer values, health and well-being. Big transformation represents big opportunity, and we as an organization need to be at the forefront of this change. 
My first 40 days at Kraft Heinz have been rich in learning with honest and candid conversations with our global leaders, employees as well as our customers. I've held numerous town halls, had one-on one with more than 300 employees and had the chance to visit all of our major offices around the world. 
Those conversations have left me with an enormous appreciation for the team that we have here at Kraft Heinz. Our team is hard-working and motivated to drive the next chapter of the business. And the consistent message I hear from them is that while they've been through a lot, they still have a strong desire to win. Their commitment to the company is why I'm privileged to be their leader. 
But before we get into my first impressions and thoughts on our path forward, I'm going to ask David to review our first half results."

First off, with the filing of forms 10-Q for both the first and second quarters, we expect to regain our current filer status with the SEC. The accounting review and audit process for our 10-K was a thorough and time-intensive effort, and we restated past periods for misstatements that have occurred over the past 4 fiscal years. 
Overall, the magnitude of adjustments to our historical numbers was a cumulative impact from 2015 to 2018 of less than 1% of net income. We are now taking extensive actions to improve internal policies and procedures and to strengthen internal controls, including over financial reporting. 
To date, we have already implemented a comprehensive disciplinary plan for all employees found to have engaged in this conduct; enhanced our organization, augmenting our procurement finance teams with additional experienced professionals in the area of supplier contracts and related arrangements; as well as realigned reporting lines so procurement finance now reports directly to the finance organization; and have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls for financial reporting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed. 
We're also in the process of reassessing employees' KPIs and will be implementing checkpoints to evaluate the impact from significant changes in the environment as well as evaluating potential solutions to upgrade our procurement management software and deploying a comprehensive global procurement training program. 
Taking these steps to improve internal controls is of the utmost importance for our Board, Miguel and myself. It will continue to be a high priority for the organization going forward. And I would like to thank all parties for their support and dedication, especially our finance and legal teams, our Board of Directors, our financial partners, among others. 
Regarding our first half performance, overall, while our consumption and share trends continue to improve, our first half results were held back by actions at a number of our retail partners in both the U.S. and Canada to reduce the amount of inventory they carry. We continue to suffer from higher supply chain costs, and frankly, the absolute level of year-on-year declines in EBITDA and EPS are simply unacceptable. 
If you recall, in February, we set out priorities around improving our growth and returns by driving consumption and market share and leveraging in-store sales and e-commerce investments to build our brands and grow our categories. So far this year, our retail takeaway in both the United States and Canada has continued to grow and improve since the second half of 2018 and into the first half of 2019. 
In the United States, first half consumption in measured channels was up 1.1% versus the prior year with market share gains in more than half of our business. In Canada, retail sales consumption grew nearly 4% in the first half, although this was aided by a return to a more normal promotional calendar versus the prior year. And we've continued our strong push on condiments and sauces around the world with significant advertising and merchandising activity behind the Heinz 150-year anniversary. But on the whole, we are dissatisfied with our financial performance year-to-date as well as the fact that retailer inventory reductions dampened our potential for the first half and the full year.
In terms of sales for the first half, we outlined in February the sources of our organic net sales decline. These included unfavorable promotional timing in both the United States and Canada as well as difficult comparisons versus an exceptionally strong prior year in U.K. soups. In addition to that, we also saw a negative impact from lower inventory levels at retail in North America that we did not anticipate, as well as lost sales due to trade negotiations in parts of Continental Europe as we implemented good, better, best pricing in ketchup between our Heinz and newly repatriated Kraft brands.
From a total company perspective, organic net sales were down 1.5% in the first half, including an adverse impact of approximately 1.2 percentage points from retail inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Volume mix was relatively flat in the first half as the reduction in retail inventory levels more than offset consumption growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America. 
Pricing was negative, down 1.3 percentage points, driven by 3 factors. The first factor driving lower pricing was unfavorable timing of promotional expense, representing a roughly 80 basis point decrease in price on a global basis, including approximately 90 basis points in the U.S. In the U.S., while we expected promotional timing to be a source of year-over-year decline in the first half, it should turn favorable in the second half of the year and therefore relatively neutral for the full year. By contrast, the step-up in Canada reflects greater activity versus last year, including the natural cheese business that we just sold and it's not likely to reverse in the second half. 
The second factor was key commodity-driven pricing in North America, representing a roughly 30 basis point drag on global pricing in the first half. And third, the remainder primarily reflects continued promotional support behind select U.S. categories, mainly in our Lunchables and frozen categories. 
With respect to profitability, we spoke about our first quarter and indeed our first half being up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year. This reflected our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up fixed cost investments and retail channel growth, marketing and our people as well as pricing not beginning to take effect until the second quarter. 
In the end, the cost inflation picture, while improving, remains unfavorable versus the prior year across packaging, manufacturing and logistics in the United States. And this, together with stepped-up fixed cost investments, drove roughly half of the constant currency production and first half EBITDA we saw versus the prior year. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, the decline we saw in the first half reflected lower adjusted EBITDA as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses versus the prior year period. Other income and our effective tax rate versus the first half of 2018 were more favorable than we expected such that, in total, the [ low-growth ] items were a $0.02 benefit to adjusted EPS versus the first 6 months of 2018. 
From a forward-looking perspective, we have now completed the 2 divestitures we previously announced, India nutritional beverages and Canada natural cheese. These divestitures resulted in a combined the after-tax proceeds of more than $1.5 billion, and we remain committed to using those proceeds to further deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet. 
However, I will highlight here that with regard to our effective tax rate, we continue to expect roughly 21% for the full year. The first half was only 18.4% due to the timing of discrete items, but this benefit is not expected to repeat, resulting in a higher rate in the second half, especially in Q3. 
And for the second half of 2019 specifically, we continue to expect to see an improvement in year-over-year top and bottom line growth rates versus what we saw in the first half. This should be driven by continued momentum in consumer uptake and more innovation coming to market; improved pricing trends, particularly as our price increases in the U.S. take hold; and lapping some of the stepped-up fixed costs and cost inflation that we saw in the back half of last year. Although I would note that we are seeing risk from further reductions in retail or inventory levels as well as accelerating key commodity costs in the U.S. that we had not anticipated at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back to Miguel."

I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point,",1549,"Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point, I think it's important to make a candid assessment of where I think we are today.
At the outset, I shared many of the concerns that a good number of you have expressed over things like brand support, supply chain execution, the sustainability of our profits and just how long it would take to be in the position to start growing both the top line and the bottom lines. And now our Board of Directors made it clear that they wanted to bring change in light of the company's recent missteps and have given me their full support to contemplate any path that will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. 
So far, I have found, as you might expect, things that are rarely as bad or as good as what you read from the outside. What is clear is that we win when we strongly and consistently invest in our brands. For instance, thanks to innovations and investments to extend a 150-year-old brand into new segments, Heinz achieved an all-time high market share in U.S. ketchup, reaching 70% in the second quarter. And Philadelphia has consistently grown share and grown the category year-over-year since 2014 with a 68% share year-to-date by setting the standard for superior quality and taste.
We have also built a world-class quality organization that has had the fewest recalls in the food industry over the past 4 years. Since 2015, we invested more than $1 billion of CapEx in North America alone, including significant investments on the end of the line for detection, risk avoidance and consumer complaint mitigation. These are just some examples of great things I've seen at the company in my early days. But it's also important to face the cold, hard facts and assess where we have had shortfalls. 
First and foremost, the company had a significant decline in adjusted EBITDA margins from a peak of 29.4% in the fiscal 2017 to roughly 24.5% for the trailing 12 months through the end of June this year. This was driven by a combination of inflation in our supply chain, including packaging freight over time and maintenance costs as well as significant step-up in fixed costs to support sales growth with price increases lagging higher costs.
Regarding our supply chain problems in 2018, it's clear we lost forecast accuracy and our ability to execute productivity initiatives to offset market inflation. I believe we persisted with integration-minded cost-cutting and did not pivot to a continuous-improvement productivity-driven mindset soon enough. 
Before I arrived, the company started to take actions to make sure this doesn't happen again, but I see opportunity to go further by bringing in more technical expertise in critical areas, by improving collaboration and process between our category and supply chain teams, by doing a better job of understanding root causes of supply chain losses. And this needs to be supported by our finance team, leading a cross-functional effort to improve visibility. 
So one of my main priorities now and going forward is to make sure we have a much better visibility in our supply chain as well as more robust ongoing productivity initiatives. I believe this critical part of the company should and can generate significant productivity. If we have the proper visibility, we can build a solid pipeline of efficiencies-oriented initiatives across our value chain.
Moving to our fixed costs or SG&A. Since 2015, we have taken out significant costs from the business. We also reinvested roughly $300 million last year in areas like people, go-to-market capabilities, marketing and innovation. To be honest, it's too early for me to tell which investments will generate the returns we expect, but my experience tells me that whenever there are a lot of big investments in such a short period of time, it's difficult to see all of them working at once. 
It's therefore critical that we prioritize the ones that are working and that fit the strategic agenda that we are currently developing. And for the investments that are not working, we move those dollars to areas that may need more investment. As examples, I believe our investments in media remain low despite fixed costs and overall marketing spend increasing over the past 2 years. 
On the brand and innovation side, we need to become more consumer-obsessed so we can better predict their behavior even before they know it. There are practices that need to change in the product development process so we can be faster and more consumer centric with our new products. And we need to better balance spending on market innovations versus core brand support. 
And in terms of retail channel development, Kraft Heinz has grown rapidly and has had strong share performance in e-commerce that we really need to take a step back and develop a longer-term outlook of the channel growth and how Kraft Heinz can win and assess the incrementality of each customer.
So it's not just about cutting costs. It's becoming more about efficiency and making dollars already in our base work harder elsewhere. 
Let me turn now to my priorities and the opportunities I see ahead of us. When I became CEO last month, I established 3 immediate goals with the Board. The first, which should be obvious, is to get to know our business, our consumers, our customers and our colleagues. The second is to execute our existing 2019 business plan. And the third and most important is to lead a comprehensive review to develop a new strategic agenda for the next 3 to 5 years. 
It is critical that we get the organization to concentrate on setting our strategic direction and laying the foundation for our future now. We need to ask ourselves the hard questions about our business, not thinking about the short term or next quarter. And we need to take the time to seek out external and internal inspiration and build on best practices, both within Kraft Heinz and from other world-class brands. 
From a financial perspective, we do expect many of the top and bottom line factors that held back the first half to fade in the second half. But I've asked David that we not provide or update specific point estimate financial guidance. Setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities. 
In addition, as I'm learning the business and develop our strategic agenda, I want us to spend more time evaluating the questions of divestitures. We absolutely remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating, but our more urgent priority is to get the organization fixated on our consumers and customers, and in this process, ensure we don't rush to give away potential value to others. We have already started the work and taken some early actions to put in place the right team and the right structure to help achieve my 3 immediate priorities. 
As you may have seen, my first act as CEO was to make some changes in our structure to help accelerate our progress. First, I have taken on the U.S. president role on an interim basis. U.S. represents 70% of our company and this will help me understand our business, consumers and the customers faster. For me, this deep dive is an essential step to developing the right plan that drives sustainable growth and shareholder value for Kraft Heinz. 
I also established a new role, International Zone President for Kraft Heinz, combining our EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American zones, representing 20% of our global business. We did this to create a streamlined, more robust international structure to find commonalities, define their strategy and drive the business with greater speed. We will continue to share more of our approach to the strategic agenda over the coming quarters. We expect to complete our work by the year-end and anticipate sharing our conclusions with you early next year.
As we do with this plan, my experience has shown that to truly change the momentum of a business, we must understand the future, identifying where the consumer, their needs and the marketplace are headed, and then invest quickly and consistently to make sure our core brands will serve those needs better than the competition. Further, I believe we can and must find internal efficiencies, whether in our supply chain or fixed cost base that have both increased substantially in the last 2 years that can help to fund the strategy. 
Intense discipline is a virtue, but it's not an end in itself. I believe great companies are the ones that keep expenses under control so they can use the capital for new investments that grow both the top line and the bottom line. It's not one or the other. And as I look ahead, I'm very excited about the opportunities at Kraft Heinz. Similar to my attention to consumers, customers and colleagues, I also look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and quarters. 
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

I really believe on the power of brands, and I think that we have an amazing portfolio of brands. Some are shiny, some are not. But I think that the heritage that we have in the brands, the household penetration that we have, the awareness that we have makes me feel very positive about the possibility of turning around some of the trends that we have in the brands that are not doing as well. I also think that we have a great scale, and that is a big competitive advantage in America. And I'm also very, very excited about the possibility of turning the business around. I've done it before in my life, and I think that it is possible. 
Now to take a business around, I think it's critical that we define comprehensive strategy, and this strategy has to be based on understanding the future, understanding the consumer. I believe that if we -- that the industry is in a huge transformation today, and transformation is also a moment of opportunity. And the ones that are going to take this opportunity are the ones that will understand the future better than the others, so then we'll lead. The ones that will not understand will follow, and the followers will not win. So we need, again, steps, a comprehensive simple strategy for the future and be very disciplined on making and executing it. So I'm very excited. I'm much more excited today after 40 days than I was on day 1 about our future."

Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest more, especially in our people and our brands. I think that, as I said before, that our media investments are below where they should be. But before going after new investments, I would really look at the possibility of inefficiencies in the system so I can reorganize and redeploy these investments. I'm still -- of course, it's early to talk about it, but I'm seeing a lot of inefficiencies, and these for me are big opportunities. 
I'll give you just 2 examples so I'm not so theoretical. In marketing, Andrew, we increased investments in the last 2 years. But in media, we've been declining. We grew investments or we put money behind many other things, agency fees, production, research, product development. But the things that the consumer really sees, we declined to pay the other expense. These for me are inefficiencies that we can redeploy. 
I'll give you another example. Maybe because of all the complexity that we put in the system, our supply chain losses have been increasing, actually, double digits in the last years. That's not acceptable. We need to understand very well the root causes of these supply chain losses and that's to reduce them. These are losses that can be converted in investments. So just 2 examples of inefficiencies that I see very early here in my job, and this has to be my focus. Before talking about new investments and reducing the margin, I would -- I'm going after inefficiencies that I can put back in the system to feed the growth, and I'm seeing that."

So Chris, let me go back a little bit in time at Kraft Heinz. I think that when you put 2 companies together, the first cycle -- or first phase or the first cycle has to be really about bringing in new culture and extracting inefficiencies. And I think that the company did a good job on that. We extracted a lot of efficiencies. We cut a lot of costs. But then after 2 years, it's hard to continue cutting costs. You need to change the strategy or you need to change the path. 
The first year, you have 2 CEOs. You cut 1 CEO, that's a cost cutting. But the following year, you don't have another CEO to cut. Cost cutting is a one-off activity and is necessary when you have the opportunity. But then you have to move and you have to think about how do you reduce costs but in a different way. And that way is, really, you have to change the way of operating the business. It's about efficiencies. It's about making better every day forever. You need to change the mindset. And if you continue cutting costs, you can get in trouble. 
I think that this second phase starts now with me. Yes, it could have started before. And I think the company would have benefit from that, but it didn't. And so it's time now with me, and I'm going to put a big emphasis on that. Not on cost cutting, but on efficiencies in the system, extracting inefficiencies from the system, making better every day, making our factories much more efficient, making our execution in sales much better, making our market investments, as I mentioned before, much better as well, so we invest on things that the consumers see not on the consumer doesn't see, et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question, Chris."

So like Miguel said, we're not providing point estimate guidance, but I can give some additional color on some of the items below the line. 
So we continue to expect up to $0.25 of unfavorability below our adjusted EBITDA line for the full year relative to 2018, and this negative impact will be greater in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half for a couple of different reasons. First off, the largest driver is tax. We had some discrete benefits in the first half, whereas we expect some discrete costs within the back half of the year. 
Second, we did see some FX favorability in the first half in other income that may flip in the second half. Third, related to incentive-based comp, we'll have a significant expense in the second half of the year, and this is due to the timing of the delayed filings of our 10-K and our 10-Qs, whereas typically expect that to happen in the first half of the full year. And then finally, we may see some higher interest expense in the second half as well."

I think that, first, because I believe that for Kraft Heinz, now we need -- what we don't need is to be focused on internal -- on product targets on the short term. We have a big agenda to build. We have a second half to deliver. But I think that working on structure and targets will not help. 
But second, since I've been here just for 40 days, I wouldn't feel comfortable about giving a guidance that I still do not have the necessary confidence about that number. I'm not sure if I'm going to overachieve by second half, if I'm going to underachieve or I will achieve. When -- in this situation, when managers look at the leaders always with empty pockets, right, like they don't know me yet. But what I know is that in the second half, some of the pressures that we had in the first half will fade, pressures like supply costs or even commercial costs. And that is positive. 
However, there's also risks, and risks such as further retailer inventory reductions, commodity inflation in categories where private label has had a lot of success like natural cheese, meat and coffee. But one observation that I can -- that I made early on is that from a seasonality standpoint, historically, Kraft Heinz usually earns 50% of the 50 -- at least 50% of the EBITDA in the first half of the year, but that's just an observation. So we'll see how we do."

So like I said before, we do expect to see better year-on-year performance on top and bottom line in the second half versus the first half. And some of the drivers are what's consistent with what we said in February, and there's some new potential risks to that as well. So what hasn't changed versus our expectations in February are continued retail takeaway that we've seen in the market with U.S. consumption up 1%, Canada consumption up 4% and that we expect to be -- continue to be supported by accelerated innovation in the back half. And we've also seen some promising growth globally in our Foodservice business as well. 
On top of that, we expect to see improved pricing trends in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half. And this will happen with some of the trade timing that we're lapping as well as the price increases in the U.S. that we implemented later in the first half that we'll fully lap in the second half as well. And then finally, on the positive side, as Miguel mentioned earlier, we do expect to see improving cost inflation as we start to lap some of the higher costs that we had in the second half of 2018. 
What has changed versus our expectations in February and as we progress through Q2, is we do see risks for further retail inventory reductions in the second half. Although we can't say what that may look like, we do see additional risk. And on top of that, we also see risk from accelerating key commodity inflation, particularly in the U.S. in meats and dairy. But we'll definitely try to manage via price but could be a risk to us in the second half. And then finally, we also have some potential adverse currency translation versus our expectations in February."

So examples, I was talking here with my colleagues that a country that I know very well, China. In China, we have a very good business on soy sauce. We are leaders in 2 of the provinces, Guandong and Fujian. They're 2 of the most -- the richest provinces. But we are only there. It's a business or it's an industry -- starts off as an industry of $12 billion, it grows 8% per year and we have great equity there. But we are just in 2 provinces. Big opportunities to grow outside of this provinces. There's a big opportunity to have other sauces, not only soy sauce. Why haven't we done it? I don't know exactly. But I see this as a big opportunity, it's a white space that we have to organize ourselves for growth. 
It's also mentality, it's mindset, that we have to do it. And to fund -- and we have to work on the other side to fund these growth initiatives. We have to be very efficient. We have to be more efficient than everybody else. And to tell you the truth, when I came and when arrived here, I was absolutely sure that I would find these opportunities for growth, I was not sure if we had the opportunities for efficiencies because I didn't know the business. And I -- today, I know that we have. 
But there are many other white spaces like in the West, talking about ethnicity. 20% of the population in America are Hispanics and represents 40% of the growth of the population. We don't have absolutely anything in our portfolio today to attend this population. We don't even communicate to the Hispanic community. That is an opportunity. 
So I'm looking at these opportunities everywhere from a brand standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from an ethnicity standpoint, from a country standpoint. And this will be only inputs that we will put in our strat plan that we'll present to our Board at the end of the year and to you at the beginning of next year. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question."

So this is what's [ part ] and we are putting things in place, the present working on simple things, which is basically execution. We are in a much better place. 
Now for the future, what we did was to open a front, both with inside and outside or external people or talent, to help us define what is this map for efficiencies for the future. We opened 8 fronts that go from supply chain losses to service level, that go to people, that go to costs, is there productivity on the lines. And these are not -- it's not a project, this will be a way of living. We've been too focused on the present and literally on firefighting. If there's a fire there, let's extinguish the fire.

We haven't seen consumption up for a long time. Shares are flat. And I would say the same -- here in front of me I have here reports from Nielsen with 21 categories, 13 of them had positive shares in the first half of the year. So I could argue with you that some of -- there are a lot of investments that are working. I would mention Heinz Ketchup, with the innovation that we had and the communication, is a very good example. Innovation to premiumize the brand, launching organic version, no added sugar, that we can charge more, that have higher margins. And that helps us well in the image of the brand. And that is a very good example of what to do. We put more money behind the brand and we achieve all-time share, achieving 70% share. That's a good example. 
So -- but on the other hand, again, as I said, I think we can do a much better job on focus on investments on core brands, not dilute at among a lot of brands and small brands. Do more innovation on big brands instead of launching too many new brands. Having innovation that is more incremental and not dilutive. I think we did a lot of brand extensions but not enough of a creative innovation. So there's the big homework to be done in marketing. I don't think everything is wrong at all. I think there are a lot of good examples. But we could -- we can do better and consistently invest in our brands."

Two questions from me as well, and you probably just kind of touched on it by referencing the consumption and market share trends. But I appreciate the commentary on the reinvestment into people, in media and maybe into some white space opportunities. A lot of investors we speak with have also questioned whether or not investment may be necessary in price, whether it be to narrow price gaps with private label or change the economics of retailers to incent them to focus more on your brands. I would love it if you could just maybe comment on that, on where you see these price gaps and the retail economics today, and whether or not you think they're properly aligned."

Specifically on pricing, I think that on categories that we lead, we need to meet the pricing. And maybe in the past, it took us too much time to pass inflation and have suffered with that. I also think that pricing -- averages on pricing are dangerous because we have brands like Heinz Ketchup or like Philadelphia that industrial innovation -- or not innovation, we have been able to pass price. And we continue growing and we're achieving all-time highs market share. But of course, we have more pressure on categories where we have more competition from private label and where -- are more driven by commodities like cheese. 
So David mentioned before that, yes, one of the risks we have in the second half is because cheese -- the commodity of cheese is increasing dramatically, the price of cheese. And we have asking prices. And they are expecting private label to follow, but we don't know. We don't know if -- so that's a risk. So that would be my comments on pricing. 
But I would like to go beyond. I think opportunities in revenue management exists as well. I think we can do a better job of -- to maximize the discounts. Discount is a big investment. And I think we can be much better on allocating discounts by accounts, by product, throughout the year. Understand better what works and in what way and when and how. And I also think that innovation can play a big role on revenue management and, as a consequence, on pricing. So I think there are good opportunities in this area that I want to explore moving forward."

So on the impairment side, first off, our impairment testing, as you know, occurs in Q2 every year. And so we performed our testing procedures this year after we filed the 10-K concurrent with preparing our Q1 and Q2 financial statements. And to reiterate, these are preliminary numbers that we disclosed in the 8-K. 
So the preliminary impairment charges in the first half were driven by 2 main factors. So first off, as you said, we did have revised expectations in response to current market factors in some of our international businesses that were evaluated during the first quarter of 2019 as we developed these 5-year plans. And as a reminder, these are the EMEA East reporting unit, LTA Exports reporting unit and Brazil where we had an impairment.
Secondly, we also had the application of a higher discount rate to reflect the sustained decline in our stock price since the start of the year. And so also, we should keep in mind that we did start the year with nearly $60 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles with less than 20% cushion relative to their carrying value. So what that means is there's going to be continued risk of future impairments, given any change in forecast or modeling assumption can particularly trigger that. 
And to answer your question specifically. As we kind of updated and developed these operating forecasts, we did have lower revenue and margin expectations, specifically for the 3 reporting units that I mentioned, EMEA East, Brazil and LTA Exports. The 6 brands that were impaired within Q2 were driven by the increased discount rate, which again was reflecting the sustained reduction in our stock price since the start of the year."

Steve, look, we'll update you throughout -- or through the rest of the year on how strategic work is going, but it's our intention to share with our Board at the end of the year and then sharing with you at the beginning of next year. 
Now talking a little bit about my experience with food -- well, with beer and how this has -- can be adapted to food. I think there are lot of similarities, but there are a lot of differences as well. And I think this has been actually pretty good, arriving here with fresh eyes and asking questions that some were obvious but people were not asking themselves for a long time. Some were not obvious and they had not been asked about it before. And so this has been positive. 
I think that my experience in the past, both from leading global brands at ABI and using premiumization as a way to grow top line, were very interesting. When I was Head of Marketing, ABI has been growing substantially because of mix, because of premium brands, and I think, to me, this is an opportunity in the food industry. There is a big premiumization going on, but the premiumization actually is coming much more from the small players not from the big food players. But let me share with you another experience from my past that, I think, we can adapt here in -- at Kraft Heinz. 
I ran our business in Asia, and China has been the best story of organic growth for ABI. And the reason why we succeeded was because we understood the future of business in China better than anybody else. And we understood that the economic growth would bring huge premiumization, wealth, the channels would change -- night-life channel would grow immensely. And so we'd make all the best in the future. We'd make all the best in what would grow not what was big necessarily. And that happened. 
And making that parallel with Kraft Heinz, I think this is critical for us. Yes, we need to navigate through the present, but we need to give a strategy for the future. We need to define where this business is going to grow, where food is going to grow and be ahead of everybody else. In the case of China, we understood that much better even than the local brewers. We understood China better than them. And I think that, again, this what I was talking about the future before. If we understand the future and we lead the future, we're going to win. And the ones that will not understand will just follow. And I really want to be in the first group not in the second group.
So -- and as I said before, there's big transformation in food. Negative people would be afraid of that. I'm an optimistic by nature, and I believe that this transformation is an area of big opportunity. And the ones that will understand the future are the ones that are going to win, and we'll be those. 
Well, this was the last question. I just would like to finish by saying a couple of words maybe summarizing a little bit of what we talked during this call. 
I wanted to tell you, to reinforce, how excited and how delighted I am with the opportunity to take Kraft Heinz to the next level. I am, the way that you are, disappointed with the first half results, but I'm determined to rebuild our business momentum. I have our Board's support, and not only support, and expectation to set a new direction, a new forward. And for me, there are no sacred cows, no preconceived ideas, just fresh eyes and just thinking about what is best for our great company. 
I know there's a lot of headwinds, but I see also encouraging solid consumption trends that are very positive. But we must continue to work our portfolio, our strategy and invest strategically to put ourselves in a position for top line and bottom line growth. We need to improve our speed. We need to become absolutely obsessed with the consumer and understanding the future better than anybody else. We need to pivot from a cost-cutting mentality to a continuous improvement, efficiency-focused. And we need to strengthen the balance sheet. That remains a priority.
So thank you very much for your time. I'm delighted to be here with you today and really looking forward to knowing you personally and to be sharing our -- my views and to be learning from you as well. Thank you very much."

Well, first of all, I'm honored to be with you today as the new CEO of Kraft Heinz. As someone who has worked on some of the biggest brands in the world, I know intimately they have power in the marketplace and with consumers. Kraft Heinz has some of the globe's best roughly 200 brands in nearly 200 countries, with nearly 20 of them maintaining their relevance for 100 years or more. We are in 97% of American households today, holding the #1 or 2 spots in 50 categories. 
And I'm humbled to follow the great CEOs that have successfully adapted our brands and businesses through periods of tremendous change over more than 100 years. These are great assets for any business, but at Kraft Heinz, we have far bigger aspirations. That's why I wanted to be candid with you from the start of my tenure here. The valuation of our stock is now among the lowest in the industry, and you deserve straight talk from me about how this business is run. I promise that to you today and for as long as I'm here. 
The entire Board has mandated a new approach to Kraft Heinz. As such, it's my job to tell you what we got wrong and why we got it wrong. Over the coming months, I will share more with you about how we'll fix it, but it starts right now with me and our entire senior management team. Our brands are icons, it's our job to ensure they are living icons.
To do that, we must understand the future so we can lead, not follow. We must understand the consumer better than any other company. We have a good start on being data and process-driven, but we must put more attention on deep consumer insights. For instance, we have sophisticated tools to tell quality-made impressions versus those that don't reach the consumer. But we are also the company that had the first plant-based burger, the Boca Burger, but find ourselves far behind the plant-based market today. 
Many of you believe our story as one of cost control and zero-based budgeting. These have been strengths for our company because they have enhanced our margins since the time of our merger. Without this discipline, we would be in a worse place today. But we have to do more than that. We need to change so we can apply strong, consistent investment in our brands. 
There is no doubt our industry is in such a big moment of transformation in retail, nontraditional channels, private label, premiumization, consumer values, health and well-being. Big transformation represents big opportunity, and we as an organization need to be at the forefront of this change. 
My first 40 days at Kraft Heinz have been rich in learning with honest and candid conversations with our global leaders, employees as well as our customers. I've held numerous town halls, had one-on one with more than 300 employees and had the chance to visit all of our major offices around the world. 
Those conversations have left me with an enormous appreciation for the team that we have here at Kraft Heinz. Our team is hard-working and motivated to drive the next chapter of the business. And the consistent message I hear from them is that while they've been through a lot, they still have a strong desire to win. Their commitment to the company is why I'm privileged to be their leader. 
But before we get into my first impressions and thoughts on our path forward, I'm going to ask David to review our first half results."

First off, with the filing of forms 10-Q for both the first and second quarters, we expect to regain our current filer status with the SEC. The accounting review and audit process for our 10-K was a thorough and time-intensive effort, and we restated past periods for misstatements that have occurred over the past 4 fiscal years. 
Overall, the magnitude of adjustments to our historical numbers was a cumulative impact from 2015 to 2018 of less than 1% of net income. We are now taking extensive actions to improve internal policies and procedures and to strengthen internal controls, including over financial reporting. 
To date, we have already implemented a comprehensive disciplinary plan for all employees found to have engaged in this conduct; enhanced our organization, augmenting our procurement finance teams with additional experienced professionals in the area of supplier contracts and related arrangements; as well as realigned reporting lines so procurement finance now reports directly to the finance organization; and have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls for financial reporting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed. 
We're also in the process of reassessing employees' KPIs and will be implementing checkpoints to evaluate the impact from significant changes in the environment as well as evaluating potential solutions to upgrade our procurement management software and deploying a comprehensive global procurement training program. 
Taking these steps to improve internal controls is of the utmost importance for our Board, Miguel and myself. It will continue to be a high priority for the organization going forward. And I would like to thank all parties for their support and dedication, especially our finance and legal teams, our Board of Directors, our financial partners, among others. 
Regarding our first half performance, overall, while our consumption and share trends continue to improve, our first half results were held back by actions at a number of our retail partners in both the U.S. and Canada to reduce the amount of inventory they carry. We continue to suffer from higher supply chain costs, and frankly, the absolute level of year-on-year declines in EBITDA and EPS are simply unacceptable. 
If you recall, in February, we set out priorities around improving our growth and returns by driving consumption and market share and leveraging in-store sales and e-commerce investments to build our brands and grow our categories. So far this year, our retail takeaway in both the United States and Canada has continued to grow and improve since the second half of 2018 and into the first half of 2019. 
In the United States, first half consumption in measured channels was up 1.1% versus the prior year with market share gains in more than half of our business. In Canada, retail sales consumption grew nearly 4% in the first half, although this was aided by a return to a more normal promotional calendar versus the prior year. And we've continued our strong push on condiments and sauces around the world with significant advertising and merchandising activity behind the Heinz 150-year anniversary. But on the whole, we are dissatisfied with our financial performance year-to-date as well as the fact that retailer inventory reductions dampened our potential for the first half and the full year.
In terms of sales for the first half, we outlined in February the sources of our organic net sales decline. These included unfavorable promotional timing in both the United States and Canada as well as difficult comparisons versus an exceptionally strong prior year in U.K. soups. In addition to that, we also saw a negative impact from lower inventory levels at retail in North America that we did not anticipate, as well as lost sales due to trade negotiations in parts of Continental Europe as we implemented good, better, best pricing in ketchup between our Heinz and newly repatriated Kraft brands.
From a total company perspective, organic net sales were down 1.5% in the first half, including an adverse impact of approximately 1.2 percentage points from retail inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Volume mix was relatively flat in the first half as the reduction in retail inventory levels more than offset consumption growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America. 
Pricing was negative, down 1.3 percentage points, driven by 3 factors. The first factor driving lower pricing was unfavorable timing of promotional expense, representing a roughly 80 basis point decrease in price on a global basis, including approximately 90 basis points in the U.S. In the U.S., while we expected promotional timing to be a source of year-over-year decline in the first half, it should turn favorable in the second half of the year and therefore relatively neutral for the full year. By contrast, the step-up in Canada reflects greater activity versus last year, including the natural cheese business that we just sold and it's not likely to reverse in the second half. 
The second factor was key commodity-driven pricing in North America, representing a roughly 30 basis point drag on global pricing in the first half. And third, the remainder primarily reflects continued promotional support behind select U.S. categories, mainly in our Lunchables and frozen categories. 
With respect to profitability, we spoke about our first quarter and indeed our first half being up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year. This reflected our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up fixed cost investments and retail channel growth, marketing and our people as well as pricing not beginning to take effect until the second quarter. 
In the end, the cost inflation picture, while improving, remains unfavorable versus the prior year across packaging, manufacturing and logistics in the United States. And this, together with stepped-up fixed cost investments, drove roughly half of the constant currency production and first half EBITDA we saw versus the prior year. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, the decline we saw in the first half reflected lower adjusted EBITDA as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses versus the prior year period. Other income and our effective tax rate versus the first half of 2018 were more favorable than we expected such that, in total, the [ low-growth ] items were a $0.02 benefit to adjusted EPS versus the first 6 months of 2018. 
From a forward-looking perspective, we have now completed the 2 divestitures we previously announced, India nutritional beverages and Canada natural cheese. These divestitures resulted in a combined the after-tax proceeds of more than $1.5 billion, and we remain committed to using those proceeds to further deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet. 
However, I will highlight here that with regard to our effective tax rate, we continue to expect roughly 21% for the full year. The first half was only 18.4% due to the timing of discrete items, but this benefit is not expected to repeat, resulting in a higher rate in the second half, especially in Q3. 
And for the second half of 2019 specifically, we continue to expect to see an improvement in year-over-year top and bottom line growth rates versus what we saw in the first half. This should be driven by continued momentum in consumer uptake and more innovation coming to market; improved pricing trends, particularly as our price increases in the U.S. take hold; and lapping some of the stepped-up fixed costs and cost inflation that we saw in the back half of last year. Although I would note that we are seeing risk from further reductions in retail or inventory levels as well as accelerating key commodity costs in the U.S. that we had not anticipated at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back to Miguel."

I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point,",1549,"Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point, I think it's important to make a candid assessment of where I think we are today.
At the outset, I shared many of the concerns that a good number of you have expressed over things like brand support, supply chain execution, the sustainability of our profits and just how long it would take to be in the position to start growing both the top line and the bottom lines. And now our Board of Directors made it clear that they wanted to bring change in light of the company's recent missteps and have given me their full support to contemplate any path that will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. 
So far, I have found, as you might expect, things that are rarely as bad or as good as what you read from the outside. What is clear is that we win when we strongly and consistently invest in our brands. For instance, thanks to innovations and investments to extend a 150-year-old brand into new segments, Heinz achieved an all-time high market share in U.S. ketchup, reaching 70% in the second quarter. And Philadelphia has consistently grown share and grown the category year-over-year since 2014 with a 68% share year-to-date by setting the standard for superior quality and taste.
We have also built a world-class quality organization that has had the fewest recalls in the food industry over the past 4 years. Since 2015, we invested more than $1 billion of CapEx in North America alone, including significant investments on the end of the line for detection, risk avoidance and consumer complaint mitigation. These are just some examples of great things I've seen at the company in my early days. But it's also important to face the cold, hard facts and assess where we have had shortfalls. 
First and foremost, the company had a significant decline in adjusted EBITDA margins from a peak of 29.4% in the fiscal 2017 to roughly 24.5% for the trailing 12 months through the end of June this year. This was driven by a combination of inflation in our supply chain, including packaging freight over time and maintenance costs as well as significant step-up in fixed costs to support sales growth with price increases lagging higher costs.
Regarding our supply chain problems in 2018, it's clear we lost forecast accuracy and our ability to execute productivity initiatives to offset market inflation. I believe we persisted with integration-minded cost-cutting and did not pivot to a continuous-improvement productivity-driven mindset soon enough. 
Before I arrived, the company started to take actions to make sure this doesn't happen again, but I see opportunity to go further by bringing in more technical expertise in critical areas, by improving collaboration and process between our category and supply chain teams, by doing a better job of understanding root causes of supply chain losses. And this needs to be supported by our finance team, leading a cross-functional effort to improve visibility. 
So one of my main priorities now and going forward is to make sure we have a much better visibility in our supply chain as well as more robust ongoing productivity initiatives. I believe this critical part of the company should and can generate significant productivity. If we have the proper visibility, we can build a solid pipeline of efficiencies-oriented initiatives across our value chain.
Moving to our fixed costs or SG&A. Since 2015, we have taken out significant costs from the business. We also reinvested roughly $300 million last year in areas like people, go-to-market capabilities, marketing and innovation. To be honest, it's too early for me to tell which investments will generate the returns we expect, but my experience tells me that whenever there are a lot of big investments in such a short period of time, it's difficult to see all of them working at once. 
It's therefore critical that we prioritize the ones that are working and that fit the strategic agenda that we are currently developing. And for the investments that are not working, we move those dollars to areas that may need more investment. As examples, I believe our investments in media remain low despite fixed costs and overall marketing spend increasing over the past 2 years. 
On the brand and innovation side, we need to become more consumer-obsessed so we can better predict their behavior even before they know it. There are practices that need to change in the product development process so we can be faster and more consumer centric with our new products. And we need to better balance spending on market innovations versus core brand support. 
And in terms of retail channel development, Kraft Heinz has grown rapidly and has had strong share performance in e-commerce that we really need to take a step back and develop a longer-term outlook of the channel growth and how Kraft Heinz can win and assess the incrementality of each customer.
So it's not just about cutting costs. It's becoming more about efficiency and making dollars already in our base work harder elsewhere. 
Let me turn now to my priorities and the opportunities I see ahead of us. When I became CEO last month, I established 3 immediate goals with the Board. The first, which should be obvious, is to get to know our business, our consumers, our customers and our colleagues. The second is to execute our existing 2019 business plan. And the third and most important is to lead a comprehensive review to develop a new strategic agenda for the next 3 to 5 years. 
It is critical that we get the organization to concentrate on setting our strategic direction and laying the foundation for our future now. We need to ask ourselves the hard questions about our business, not thinking about the short term or next quarter. And we need to take the time to seek out external and internal inspiration and build on best practices, both within Kraft Heinz and from other world-class brands. 
From a financial perspective, we do expect many of the top and bottom line factors that held back the first half to fade in the second half. But I've asked David that we not provide or update specific point estimate financial guidance. Setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities. 
In addition, as I'm learning the business and develop our strategic agenda, I want us to spend more time evaluating the questions of divestitures. We absolutely remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating, but our more urgent priority is to get the organization fixated on our consumers and customers, and in this process, ensure we don't rush to give away potential value to others. We have already started the work and taken some early actions to put in place the right team and the right structure to help achieve my 3 immediate priorities. 
As you may have seen, my first act as CEO was to make some changes in our structure to help accelerate our progress. First, I have taken on the U.S. president role on an interim basis. U.S. represents 70% of our company and this will help me understand our business, consumers and the customers faster. For me, this deep dive is an essential step to developing the right plan that drives sustainable growth and shareholder value for Kraft Heinz. 
I also established a new role, International Zone President for Kraft Heinz, combining our EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American zones, representing 20% of our global business. We did this to create a streamlined, more robust international structure to find commonalities, define their strategy and drive the business with greater speed. We will continue to share more of our approach to the strategic agenda over the coming quarters. We expect to complete our work by the year-end and anticipate sharing our conclusions with you early next year.
As we do with this plan, my experience has shown that to truly change the momentum of a business, we must understand the future, identifying where the consumer, their needs and the marketplace are headed, and then invest quickly and consistently to make sure our core brands will serve those needs better than the competition. Further, I believe we can and must find internal efficiencies, whether in our supply chain or fixed cost base that have both increased substantially in the last 2 years that can help to fund the strategy. 
Intense discipline is a virtue, but it's not an end in itself. I believe great companies are the ones that keep expenses under control so they can use the capital for new investments that grow both the top line and the bottom line. It's not one or the other. And as I look ahead, I'm very excited about the opportunities at Kraft Heinz. Similar to my attention to consumers, customers and colleagues, I also look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and quarters. 
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

I really believe on the power of brands, and I think that we have an amazing portfolio of brands. Some are shiny, some are not. But I think that the heritage that we have in the brands, the household penetration that we have, the awareness that we have makes me feel very positive about the possibility of turning around some of the trends that we have in the brands that are not doing as well. I also think that we have a great scale, and that is a big competitive advantage in America. And I'm also very, very excited about the possibility of turning the business around. I've done it before in my life, and I think that it is possible. 
Now to take a business around, I think it's critical that we define comprehensive strategy, and this strategy has to be based on understanding the future, understanding the consumer. I believe that if we -- that the industry is in a huge transformation today, and transformation is also a moment of opportunity. And the ones that are going to take this opportunity are the ones that will understand the future better than the others, so then we'll lead. The ones that will not understand will follow, and the followers will not win. So we need, again, steps, a comprehensive simple strategy for the future and be very disciplined on making and executing it. So I'm very excited. I'm much more excited today after 40 days than I was on day 1 about our future."

So I guess my question is do you think Kraft Heinz, with its sort of geographic portfolio and relative market share makeup, should be able to sustain the margin structure still well above the group or not? Because in your prepared remarks, I think you talked about more efficiently using the spending that's already in the base."

Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest more, especially in our people and our brands. I think that, as I said before, that our media investments are below where they should be. But before going after new investments, I would really look at the possibility of inefficiencies in the system so I can reorganize and redeploy these investments. I'm still -- of course, it's early to talk about it, but I'm seeing a lot of inefficiencies, and these for me are big opportunities. 
I'll give you just 2 examples so I'm not so theoretical. In marketing, Andrew, we increased investments in the last 2 years. But in media, we've been declining. We grew investments or we put money behind many other things, agency fees, production, research, product development. But the things that the consumer really sees, we declined to pay the other expense. These for me are inefficiencies that we can redeploy. 
I'll give you another example. Maybe because of all the complexity that we put in the system, our supply chain losses have been increasing, actually, double digits in the last years. That's not acceptable. We need to understand very well the root causes of these supply chain losses and that's to reduce them. These are losses that can be converted in investments. So just 2 examples of inefficiencies that I see very early here in my job, and this has to be my focus. Before talking about new investments and reducing the margin, I would -- I'm going after inefficiencies that I can put back in the system to feed the growth, and I'm seeing that."

So Chris, let me go back a little bit in time at Kraft Heinz. I think that when you put 2 companies together, the first cycle -- or first phase or the first cycle has to be really about bringing in new culture and extracting inefficiencies. And I think that the company did a good job on that. We extracted a lot of efficiencies. We cut a lot of costs. But then after 2 years, it's hard to continue cutting costs. You need to change the strategy or you need to change the path. 
The first year, you have 2 CEOs. You cut 1 CEO, that's a cost cutting. But the following year, you don't have another CEO to cut. Cost cutting is a one-off activity and is necessary when you have the opportunity. But then you have to move and you have to think about how do you reduce costs but in a different way. And that way is, really, you have to change the way of operating the business. It's about efficiencies. It's about making better every day forever. You need to change the mindset. And if you continue cutting costs, you can get in trouble. 
I think that this second phase starts now with me. Yes, it could have started before. And I think the company would have benefit from that, but it didn't. And so it's time now with me, and I'm going to put a big emphasis on that. Not on cost cutting, but on efficiencies in the system, extracting inefficiencies from the system, making better every day, making our factories much more efficient, making our execution in sales much better, making our market investments, as I mentioned before, much better as well, so we invest on things that the consumers see not on the consumer doesn't see, et cetera, et cetera.

So we continue to expect up to $0.25 of unfavorability below our adjusted EBITDA line for the full year relative to 2018, and this negative impact will be greater in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half for a couple of different reasons. First off, the largest driver is tax. We had some discrete benefits in the first half, whereas we expect some discrete costs within the back half of the year. 
Second, we did see some FX favorability in the first half in other income that may flip in the second half. Third, related to incentive-based comp, we'll have a significant expense in the second half of the year, and this is due to the timing of the delayed filings of our 10-K and our 10-Qs, whereas typically expect that to happen in the first half of the full year.

We have a second half to deliver. But I think that working on structure and targets will not help. 
But second, since I've been here just for 40 days, I wouldn't feel comfortable about giving a guidance that I still do not have the necessary confidence about that number. I'm not sure if I'm going to overachieve by second half, if I'm going to underachieve or I will achieve. When -- in this situation, when managers look at the leaders always with empty pockets, right, like they don't know me yet. But what I know is that in the second half, some of the pressures that we had in the first half will fade, pressures like supply costs or even commercial costs. And that is positive. 
However, there's also risks, and risks such as further retailer inventory reductions, commodity inflation in categories where private label has had a lot of success like natural cheese, meat and coffee. But one observation that I can -- that I made early on is that from a seasonality standpoint, historically, Kraft Heinz usually earns 50% of the 50 -- at least 50% of the EBITDA in the first half of the year, but that's just an observation. So we'll see how we do."

So that's right that we're not providing guidance for the full year, so we're pulling guidance. But I can provide a little bit of color on our expectations for the full year without giving enough data point estimate for sales or EBITDA. 
So like I said before, we do expect to see better year-on-year performance on top and bottom line in the second half versus the first half. And some of the drivers are what's consistent with what we said in February, and there's some new potential risks to that as well. So what hasn't changed versus our expectations in February are continued retail takeaway that we've seen in the market with U.S. consumption up 1%, Canada consumption up 4% and that we expect to be -- continue to be supported by accelerated innovation in the back half. And we've also seen some promising growth globally in our Foodservice business as well. 
On top of that, we expect to see improved pricing trends in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half. And this will happen with some of the trade timing that we're lapping as well as the price increases in the U.S. that we implemented later in the first half that we'll fully lap in the second half as well. And then finally, on the positive side, as Miguel mentioned earlier, we do expect to see improving cost inflation as we start to lap some of the higher costs that we had in the second half of 2018. 
What has changed versus our expectations in February and as we progress through Q2, is we do see risks for further retail inventory reductions in the second half. Although we can't say what that may look like, we do see additional risk. And on top of that, we also see risk from accelerating key commodity inflation, particularly in the U.S. in meats and dairy. But we'll definitely try to manage via price but could be a risk to us in the second half. And then finally, we also have some potential adverse currency translation versus our expectations in February."

But is there anything you can give us specifically in terms of what's really gone wrong on the top line? I know you mentioned media spending having gone down and so forth.

We need a strategy, first of all, for growth, which is critical. We need to find opportunities, find white spaces, what brands to invest, what channels today that we have lower share, what channels to divest more and structure for growth, what countries where we should attack and grow and invest on. And this will all be part of our strategy for growth. 
So examples, I was talking here with my colleagues that a country that I know very well, China. In China, we have a very good business on soy sauce. We are leaders in 2 of the provinces, Guandong and Fujian. They're 2 of the most -- the richest provinces. But we are only there. It's a business or it's an industry -- starts off as an industry of $12 billion, it grows 8% per year and we have great equity there. But we are just in 2 provinces. Big opportunities to grow outside of this provinces. There's a big opportunity to have other sauces, not only soy sauce. Why haven't we done it? I don't know exactly. But I see this as a big opportunity, it's a white space that we have to organize ourselves for growth. 
It's also mentality, it's mindset, that we have to do it. And to fund -- and we have to work on the other side to fund these growth initiatives. We have to be very efficient. We have to be more efficient than everybody else. And to tell you the truth, when I came and when arrived here, I was absolutely sure that I would find these opportunities for growth, I was not sure if we had the opportunities for efficiencies because I didn't know the business. And I -- today, I know that we have. 
But there are many other white spaces like in the West, talking about ethnicity. 20% of the population in America are Hispanics and represents 40% of the growth of the population. We don't have absolutely anything in our portfolio today to attend this population. We don't even communicate to the Hispanic community. That is an opportunity. 
So I'm looking at these opportunities everywhere from a brand standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from an ethnicity standpoint, from a country standpoint. And this will be only inputs that we will put in our strat plan that we'll present to our Board at the end of the year and to you at the beginning of next year. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question."

So this is what's [ part ] and we are putting things in place, the present working on simple things, which is basically execution. We are in a much better place. 
Now for the future, what we did was to open a front, both with inside and outside or external people or talent, to help us define what is this map for efficiencies for the future. We opened 8 fronts that go from supply chain losses to service level, that go to people, that go to costs, is there productivity on the lines. And these are not -- it's not a project, this will be a way of living. We've been too focused on the present and literally on firefighting. If there's a fire there, let's extinguish the fire. We need to work on our competencies for the future with the mentality of making it better every day.

We haven't seen consumption up for a long time. Shares are flat. And I would say the same -- here in front of me I have here reports from Nielsen with 21 categories, 13 of them had positive shares in the first half of the year. So I could argue with you that some of -- there are a lot of investments that are working. I would mention Heinz Ketchup, with the innovation that we had and the communication, is a very good example. Innovation to premiumize the brand, launching organic version, no added sugar, that we can charge more, that have higher margins. And that helps us well in the image of the brand. And that is a very good example of what to do. We put more money behind the brand and we achieve all-time share, achieving 70% share. That's a good example. 
So -- but on the other hand, again, as I said, I think we can do a much better job on focus on investments on core brands, not dilute at among a lot of brands and small brands. Do more innovation on big brands instead of launching too many new brands. Having innovation that is more incremental and not dilutive. I think we did a lot of brand extensions but not enough of a creative innovation. So there's the big homework to be done in marketing. I don't think everything is wrong at all. I think there are a lot of good examples. But we could -- we can do better and consistently invest in our brands."

Specifically on pricing, I think that on categories that we lead, we need to meet the pricing. And maybe in the past, it took us too much time to pass inflation and have suffered with that. I also think that pricing -- averages on pricing are dangerous because we have brands like Heinz Ketchup or like Philadelphia that industrial innovation -- or not innovation, we have been able to pass price. And we continue growing and we're achieving all-time highs market share. But of course, we have more pressure on categories where we have more competition from private label and where -- are more driven by commodities like cheese. 
So David mentioned before that, yes, one of the risks we have in the second half is because cheese -- the commodity of cheese is increasing dramatically, the price of cheese. And we have asking prices. And they are expecting private label to follow, but we don't know. We don't know if -- so that's a risk. So that would be my comments on pricing. 
But I would like to go beyond. I think opportunities in revenue management exists as well. I think we can do a better job of -- to maximize the discounts. Discount is a big investment. And I think we can be much better on allocating discounts by accounts, by product, throughout the year. Understand better what works and in what way and when and how. And I also think that innovation can play a big role on revenue management and, as a consequence, on pricing. So I think there are good opportunities in this area that I want to explore moving forward."

So on the impairment side, first off, our impairment testing, as you know, occurs in Q2 every year. And so we performed our testing procedures this year after we filed the 10-K concurrent with preparing our Q1 and Q2 financial statements. And to reiterate, these are preliminary numbers that we disclosed in the 8-K. 
So the preliminary impairment charges in the first half were driven by 2 main factors. So first off, as you said, we did have revised expectations in response to current market factors in some of our international businesses that were evaluated during the first quarter of 2019 as we developed these 5-year plans. And as a reminder, these are the EMEA East reporting unit, LTA Exports reporting unit and Brazil where we had an impairment.
Secondly, we also had the application of a higher discount rate to reflect the sustained decline in our stock price since the start of the year. And so also, we should keep in mind that we did start the year with nearly $60 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles with less than 20% cushion relative to their carrying value. So what that means is there's going to be continued risk of future impairments, given any change in forecast or modeling assumption can particularly trigger that. 
And to answer your question specifically. As we kind of updated and developed these operating forecasts, we did have lower revenue and margin expectations, specifically for the 3 reporting units that I mentioned, EMEA East, Brazil and LTA Exports. The 6 brands that were impaired within Q2 were driven by the increased discount rate, which again was reflecting the sustained reduction in our stock price since the start of the year."

Steve, look, we'll update you throughout -- or through the rest of the year on how strategic work is going, but it's our intention to share with our Board at the end of the year and then sharing with you at the beginning of next year. 
Now talking a little bit about my experience with food -- well, with beer and how this has -- can be adapted to food. I think there are lot of similarities, but there are a lot of differences as well. And I think this has been actually pretty good, arriving here with fresh eyes and asking questions that some were obvious but people were not asking themselves for a long time. Some were not obvious and they had not been asked about it before. And so this has been positive. 
I think that my experience in the past, both from leading global brands at ABI and using premiumization as a way to grow top line, were very interesting. When I was Head of Marketing, ABI has been growing substantially because of mix, because of premium brands, and I think, to me, this is an opportunity in the food industry. There is a big premiumization going on, but the premiumization actually is coming much more from the small players not from the big food players. But let me share with you another experience from my past that, I think, we can adapt here in -- at Kraft Heinz. 
I ran our business in Asia, and China has been the best story of organic growth for ABI. And the reason why we succeeded was because we understood the future of business in China better than anybody else. And we understood that the economic growth would bring huge premiumization, wealth, the channels would change -- night-life channel would grow immensely. And so we'd make all the best in the future. We'd make all the best in what would grow not what was big necessarily. And that happened. 
And making that parallel with Kraft Heinz, I think this is critical for us. Yes, we need to navigate through the present, but we need to give a strategy for the future. We need to define where this business is going to grow, where food is going to grow and be ahead of everybody else. In the case of China, we understood that much better even than the local brewers. We understood China better than them. And I think that, again, this what I was talking about the future before. If we understand the future and we lead the future, we're going to win. And the ones that will not understand will just follow. And I really want to be in the first group not in the second group.
So -- and as I said before, there's big transformation in food. Negative people would be afraid of that. I'm an optimistic by nature, and I believe that this transformation is an area of big opportunity. And the ones that will understand the future are the ones that are going to win, and we'll be those. 
Well, this was the last question. I just would like to finish by saying a couple of words maybe summarizing a little bit of what we talked during this call. 
I wanted to tell you, to reinforce, how excited and how delighted I am with the opportunity to take Kraft Heinz to the next level. I am, the way that you are, disappointed with the first half results, but I'm determined to rebuild our business momentum. I have our Board's support, and not only support, and expectation to set a new direction, a new forward. And for me, there are no sacred cows, no preconceived ideas, just fresh eyes and just thinking about what is best for our great company. 
I know there's a lot of headwinds, but I see also encouraging solid consumption trends that are very positive. But we must continue to work our portfolio, our strategy and invest strategically to put ourselves in a position for top line and bottom line growth. We need to improve our speed. We need to become absolutely obsessed with the consumer and understanding the future better than anybody else. We need to pivot from a cost-cutting mentality to a continuous improvement, efficiency-focused. And we need to strengthen the balance sheet. That remains a priority.
So thank you very much for your time. I'm delighted to be here with you today and really looking forward to knowing you personally and to be sharing our -- my views and to be learning from you as well. Thank you very much."

Well, first of all, I'm honored to be with you today as the new CEO of Kraft Heinz. As someone who has worked on some of the biggest brands in the world, I know intimately they have power in the marketplace and with consumers. Kraft Heinz has some of the globe's best roughly 200 brands in nearly 200 countries, with nearly 20 of them maintaining their relevance for 100 years or more. We are in 97% of American households today, holding the #1 or 2 spots in 50 categories. 
And I'm humbled to follow the great CEOs that have successfully adapted our brands and businesses through periods of tremendous change over more than 100 years. These are great assets for any business, but at Kraft Heinz, we have far bigger aspirations. That's why I wanted to be candid with you from the start of my tenure here. The valuation of our stock is now among the lowest in the industry, and you deserve straight talk from me about how this business is run. I promise that to you today and for as long as I'm here. 
The entire Board has mandated a new approach to Kraft Heinz. As such, it's my job to tell you what we got wrong and why we got it wrong. Over the coming months, I will share more with you about how we'll fix it, but it starts right now with me and our entire senior management team. Our brands are icons, it's our job to ensure they are living icons.
To do that, we must understand the future so we can lead, not follow. We must understand the consumer better than any other company. We have a good start on being data and process-driven, but we must put more attention on deep consumer insights. For instance, we have sophisticated tools to tell quality-made impressions versus those that don't reach the consumer. But we are also the company that had the first plant-based burger, the Boca Burger, but find ourselves far behind the plant-based market today. 
Many of you believe our story as one of cost control and zero-based budgeting. These have been strengths for our company because they have enhanced our margins since the time of our merger. Without this discipline, we would be in a worse place today. But we have to do more than that. We need to change so we can apply strong, consistent investment in our brands. 
There is no doubt our industry is in such a big moment of transformation in retail, nontraditional channels, private label, premiumization, consumer values, health and well-being. Big transformation represents big opportunity, and we as an organization need to be at the forefront of this change. 
My first 40 days at Kraft Heinz have been rich in learning with honest and candid conversations with our global leaders, employees as well as our customers. I've held numerous town halls, had one-on one with more than 300 employees and had the chance to visit all of our major offices around the world. 
Those conversations have left me with an enormous appreciation for the team that we have here at Kraft Heinz. Our team is hard-working and motivated to drive the next chapter of the business. And the consistent message I hear from them is that while they've been through a lot, they still have a strong desire to win. Their commitment to the company is why I'm privileged to be their leader. 
But before we get into my first impressions and thoughts on our path forward, I'm going to ask David to review our first half results."

First off, with the filing of forms 10-Q for both the first and second quarters, we expect to regain our current filer status with the SEC. The accounting review and audit process for our 10-K was a thorough and time-intensive effort, and we restated past periods for misstatements that have occurred over the past 4 fiscal years. 
Overall, the magnitude of adjustments to our historical numbers was a cumulative impact from 2015 to 2018 of less than 1% of net income. We are now taking extensive actions to improve internal policies and procedures and to strengthen internal controls, including over financial reporting. 
To date, we have already implemented a comprehensive disciplinary plan for all employees found to have engaged in this conduct; enhanced our organization, augmenting our procurement finance teams with additional experienced professionals in the area of supplier contracts and related arrangements; as well as realigned reporting lines so procurement finance now reports directly to the finance organization; and have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls for financial reporting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed. 
We're also in the process of reassessing employees' KPIs and will be implementing checkpoints to evaluate the impact from significant changes in the environment as well as evaluating potential solutions to upgrade our procurement management software and deploying a comprehensive global procurement training program. 
Taking these steps to improve internal controls is of the utmost importance for our Board, Miguel and myself. It will continue to be a high priority for the organization going forward. And I would like to thank all parties for their support and dedication, especially our finance and legal teams, our Board of Directors, our financial partners, among others. 
Regarding our first half performance, overall, while our consumption and share trends continue to improve, our first half results were held back by actions at a number of our retail partners in both the U.S. and Canada to reduce the amount of inventory they carry. We continue to suffer from higher supply chain costs, and frankly, the absolute level of year-on-year declines in EBITDA and EPS are simply unacceptable. 
If you recall, in February, we set out priorities around improving our growth and returns by driving consumption and market share and leveraging in-store sales and e-commerce investments to build our brands and grow our categories. So far this year, our retail takeaway in both the United States and Canada has continued to grow and improve since the second half of 2018 and into the first half of 2019. 
In the United States, first half consumption in measured channels was up 1.1% versus the prior year with market share gains in more than half of our business. In Canada, retail sales consumption grew nearly 4% in the first half, although this was aided by a return to a more normal promotional calendar versus the prior year. And we've continued our strong push on condiments and sauces around the world with significant advertising and merchandising activity behind the Heinz 150-year anniversary. But on the whole, we are dissatisfied with our financial performance year-to-date as well as the fact that retailer inventory reductions dampened our potential for the first half and the full year.
In terms of sales for the first half, we outlined in February the sources of our organic net sales decline. These included unfavorable promotional timing in both the United States and Canada as well as difficult comparisons versus an exceptionally strong prior year in U.K. soups. In addition to that, we also saw a negative impact from lower inventory levels at retail in North America that we did not anticipate, as well as lost sales due to trade negotiations in parts of Continental Europe as we implemented good, better, best pricing in ketchup between our Heinz and newly repatriated Kraft brands.
From a total company perspective, organic net sales were down 1.5% in the first half, including an adverse impact of approximately 1.2 percentage points from retail inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Volume mix was relatively flat in the first half as the reduction in retail inventory levels more than offset consumption growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America. 
Pricing was negative, down 1.3 percentage points, driven by 3 factors. The first factor driving lower pricing was unfavorable timing of promotional expense, representing a roughly 80 basis point decrease in price on a global basis, including approximately 90 basis points in the U.S. In the U.S., while we expected promotional timing to be a source of year-over-year decline in the first half, it should turn favorable in the second half of the year and therefore relatively neutral for the full year. By contrast, the step-up in Canada reflects greater activity versus last year, including the natural cheese business that we just sold and it's not likely to reverse in the second half. 
The second factor was key commodity-driven pricing in North America, representing a roughly 30 basis point drag on global pricing in the first half. And third, the remainder primarily reflects continued promotional support behind select U.S. categories, mainly in our Lunchables and frozen categories. 
With respect to profitability, we spoke about our first quarter and indeed our first half being up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year. This reflected our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up fixed cost investments and retail channel growth, marketing and our people as well as pricing not beginning to take effect until the second quarter. 
In the end, the cost inflation picture, while improving, remains unfavorable versus the prior year across packaging, manufacturing and logistics in the United States. And this, together with stepped-up fixed cost investments, drove roughly half of the constant currency production and first half EBITDA we saw versus the prior year. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, the decline we saw in the first half reflected lower adjusted EBITDA as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses versus the prior year period. Other income and our effective tax rate versus the first half of 2018 were more favorable than we expected such that, in total, the [ low-growth ] items were a $0.02 benefit to adjusted EPS versus the first 6 months of 2018. 
From a forward-looking perspective, we have now completed the 2 divestitures we previously announced, India nutritional beverages and Canada natural cheese. These divestitures resulted in a combined the after-tax proceeds of more than $1.5 billion, and we remain committed to using those proceeds to further deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet. 
However, I will highlight here that with regard to our effective tax rate, we continue to expect roughly 21% for the full year. The first half was only 18.4% due to the timing of discrete items, but this benefit is not expected to repeat, resulting in a higher rate in the second half, especially in Q3. 
And for the second half of 2019 specifically, we continue to expect to see an improvement in year-over-year top and bottom line growth rates versus what we saw in the first half. This should be driven by continued momentum in consumer uptake and more innovation coming to market; improved pricing trends, particularly as our price increases in the U.S. take hold; and lapping some of the stepped-up fixed costs and cost inflation that we saw in the back half of last year. Although I would note that we are seeing risk from further reductions in retail or inventory levels as well as accelerating key commodity costs in the U.S. that we had not anticipated at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back to Miguel."
278212,631499350,1817622,"The Kraft Heinz Company, H1 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2019",2019-08-08,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point,",1549,"Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point, I think it's important to make a candid assessment of where I think we are today.
At the outset, I shared many of the concerns that a good number of you have expressed over things like brand support, supply chain execution, the sustainability of our profits and just how long it would take to be in the position to start growing both the top line and the bottom lines. And now our Board of Directors made it clear that they wanted to bring change in light of the company's recent missteps and have given me their full support to contemplate any path that will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. 
So far, I have found, as you might expect, things that are rarely as bad or as good as what you read from the outside. What is clear is that we win when we strongly and consistently invest in our brands. For instance, thanks to innovations and investments to extend a 150-year-old brand into new segments, Heinz achieved an all-time high market share in U.S. ketchup, reaching 70% in the second quarter. And Philadelphia has consistently grown share and grown the category year-over-year since 2014 with a 68% share year-to-date by setting the standard for superior quality and taste.
We have also built a world-class quality organization that has had the fewest recalls in the food industry over the past 4 years. Since 2015, we invested more than $1 billion of CapEx in North America alone, including significant investments on the end of the line for detection, risk avoidance and consumer complaint mitigation. These are just some examples of great things I've seen at the company in my early days. But it's also important to face the cold, hard facts and assess where we have had shortfalls. 
First and foremost, the company had a significant decline in adjusted EBITDA margins from a peak of 29.4% in the fiscal 2017 to roughly 24.5% for the trailing 12 months through the end of June this year. This was driven by a combination of inflation in our supply chain, including packaging freight over time and maintenance costs as well as significant step-up in fixed costs to support sales growth with price increases lagging higher costs.
Regarding our supply chain problems in 2018, it's clear we lost forecast accuracy and our ability to execute productivity initiatives to offset market inflation. I believe we persisted with integration-minded cost-cutting and did not pivot to a continuous-improvement productivity-driven mindset soon enough. 
Before I arrived, the company started to take actions to make sure this doesn't happen again, but I see opportunity to go further by bringing in more technical expertise in critical areas, by improving collaboration and process between our category and supply chain teams, by doing a better job of understanding root causes of supply chain losses. And this needs to be supported by our finance team, leading a cross-functional effort to improve visibility. 
So one of my main priorities now and going forward is to make sure we have a much better visibility in our supply chain as well as more robust ongoing productivity initiatives. I believe this critical part of the company should and can generate significant productivity. If we have the proper visibility, we can build a solid pipeline of efficiencies-oriented initiatives across our value chain.
Moving to our fixed costs or SG&A. Since 2015, we have taken out significant costs from the business. We also reinvested roughly $300 million last year in areas like people, go-to-market capabilities, marketing and innovation. To be honest, it's too early for me to tell which investments will generate the returns we expect, but my experience tells me that whenever there are a lot of big investments in such a short period of time, it's difficult to see all of them working at once. 
It's therefore critical that we prioritize the ones that are working and that fit the strategic agenda that we are currently developing. And for the investments that are not working, we move those dollars to areas that may need more investment. As examples, I believe our investments in media remain low despite fixed costs and overall marketing spend increasing over the past 2 years. 
On the brand and innovation side, we need to become more consumer-obsessed so we can better predict their behavior even before they know it. There are practices that need to change in the product development process so we can be faster and more consumer centric with our new products. And we need to better balance spending on market innovations versus core brand support. 
And in terms of retail channel development, Kraft Heinz has grown rapidly and has had strong share performance in e-commerce that we really need to take a step back and develop a longer-term outlook of the channel growth and how Kraft Heinz can win and assess the incrementality of each customer.
So it's not just about cutting costs. It's becoming more about efficiency and making dollars already in our base work harder elsewhere. 
Let me turn now to my priorities and the opportunities I see ahead of us. When I became CEO last month, I established 3 immediate goals with the Board. The first, which should be obvious, is to get to know our business, our consumers, our customers and our colleagues. The second is to execute our existing 2019 business plan. And the third and most important is to lead a comprehensive review to develop a new strategic agenda for the next 3 to 5 years. 
It is critical that we get the organization to concentrate on setting our strategic direction and laying the foundation for our future now. We need to ask ourselves the hard questions about our business, not thinking about the short term or next quarter. And we need to take the time to seek out external and internal inspiration and build on best practices, both within Kraft Heinz and from other world-class brands. 
From a financial perspective, we do expect many of the top and bottom line factors that held back the first half to fade in the second half. But I've asked David that we not provide or update specific point estimate financial guidance. Setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities. 
In addition, as I'm learning the business and develop our strategic agenda, I want us to spend more time evaluating the questions of divestitures. We absolutely remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating, but our more urgent priority is to get the organization fixated on our consumers and customers, and in this process, ensure we don't rush to give away potential value to others. We have already started the work and taken some early actions to put in place the right team and the right structure to help achieve my 3 immediate priorities. 
As you may have seen, my first act as CEO was to make some changes in our structure to help accelerate our progress. First, I have taken on the U.S. president role on an interim basis. U.S. represents 70% of our company and this will help me understand our business, consumers and the customers faster. For me, this deep dive is an essential step to developing the right plan that drives sustainable growth and shareholder value for Kraft Heinz. 
I also established a new role, International Zone President for Kraft Heinz, combining our EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American zones, representing 20% of our global business. We did this to create a streamlined, more robust international structure to find commonalities, define their strategy and drive the business with greater speed. We will continue to share more of our approach to the strategic agenda over the coming quarters. We expect to complete our work by the year-end and anticipate sharing our conclusions with you early next year.
As we do with this plan, my experience has shown that to truly change the momentum of a business, we must understand the future, identifying where the consumer, their needs and the marketplace are headed, and then invest quickly and consistently to make sure our core brands will serve those needs better than the competition. Further, I believe we can and must find internal efficiencies, whether in our supply chain or fixed cost base that have both increased substantially in the last 2 years that can help to fund the strategy. 
Intense discipline is a virtue, but it's not an end in itself. I believe great companies are the ones that keep expenses under control so they can use the capital for new investments that grow both the top line and the bottom line. It's not one or the other. And as I look ahead, I'm very excited about the opportunities at Kraft Heinz. Similar to my attention to consumers, customers and colleagues, I also look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and quarters. 
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

I really believe on the power of brands, and I think that we have an amazing portfolio of brands. Some are shiny, some are not. But I think that the heritage that we have in the brands, the household penetration that we have, the awareness that we have makes me feel very positive about the possibility of turning around some of the trends that we have in the brands that are not doing as well. I also think that we have a great scale, and that is a big competitive advantage in America. And I'm also very, very excited about the possibility of turning the business around. I've done it before in my life, and I think that it is possible. 
Now to take a business around, I think it's critical that we define comprehensive strategy, and this strategy has to be based on understanding the future, understanding the consumer. I believe that if we -- that the industry is in a huge transformation today, and transformation is also a moment of opportunity. And the ones that are going to take this opportunity are the ones that will understand the future better than the others, so then we'll lead. The ones that will not understand will follow, and the followers will not win.

Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest more, especially in our people and our brands. I think that, as I said before, that our media investments are below where they should be. But before going after new investments, I would really look at the possibility of inefficiencies in the system so I can reorganize and redeploy these investments. I'm still -- of course, it's early to talk about it, but I'm seeing a lot of inefficiencies, and these for me are big opportunities. 
I'll give you just 2 examples so I'm not so theoretical. In marketing, Andrew, we increased investments in the last 2 years. But in media, we've been declining. We grew investments or we put money behind many other things, agency fees, production, research, product development. But the things that the consumer really sees, we declined to pay the other expense. These for me are inefficiencies that we can redeploy. 
I'll give you another example. Maybe because of all the complexity that we put in the system, our supply chain losses have been increasing, actually, double digits in the last years. That's not acceptable. We need to understand very well the root causes of these supply chain losses and that's to reduce them. These are losses that can be converted in investments. So just 2 examples of inefficiencies that I see very early here in my job, and this has to be my focus. Before talking about new investments and reducing the margin, I would -- I'm going after inefficiencies that I can put back in the system to feed the growth, and I'm seeing that."

I think that when you put 2 companies together, the first cycle -- or first phase or the first cycle has to be really about bringing in new culture and extracting inefficiencies. And I think that the company did a good job on that. We extracted a lot of efficiencies. We cut a lot of costs. But then after 2 years, it's hard to continue cutting costs. You need to change the strategy or you need to change the path. 
The first year, you have 2 CEOs. You cut 1 CEO, that's a cost cutting. But the following year, you don't have another CEO to cut. Cost cutting is a one-off activity and is necessary when you have the opportunity. But then you have to move and you have to think about how do you reduce costs but in a different way. And that way is, really, you have to change the way of operating the business. It's about efficiencies. It's about making better every day forever. You need to change the mindset. And if you continue cutting costs, you can get in trouble. 
I think that this second phase starts now with me. Yes, it could have started before. And I think the company would have benefit from that, but it didn't. And so it's time now with me, and I'm going to put a big emphasis on that. Not on cost cutting, but on efficiencies in the system, extracting inefficiencies from the system, making better every day, making our factories much more efficient, making our execution in sales much better, making our market investments, as I mentioned before, much better as well, so we invest on things that the consumers see not on the consumer doesn't see, et cetera, et cetera.

So we continue to expect up to $0.25 of unfavorability below our adjusted EBITDA line for the full year relative to 2018, and this negative impact will be greater in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half for a couple of different reasons. First off, the largest driver is tax. We had some discrete benefits in the first half, whereas we expect some discrete costs within the back half of the year. 
Second, we did see some FX favorability in the first half in other income that may flip in the second half. Third, related to incentive-based comp, we'll have a significant expense in the second half of the year, and this is due to the timing of the delayed filings of our 10-K and our 10-Qs, whereas typically expect that to happen in the first half of the full year. And then finally, we may see some higher interest expense in the second half as well."

I want to go further a little bit and tell you why. I think that, first, because I believe that for Kraft Heinz, now we need -- what we don't need is to be focused on internal -- on product targets on the short term. We have a big agenda to build. We have a second half to deliver. But I think that working on structure and targets will not help. 
But second, since I've been here just for 40 days, I wouldn't feel comfortable about giving a guidance that I still do not have the necessary confidence about that number. I'm not sure if I'm going to overachieve by second half, if I'm going to underachieve or I will achieve. When -- in this situation, when managers look at the leaders always with empty pockets, right, like they don't know me yet. But what I know is that in the second half, some of the pressures that we had in the first half will fade, pressures like supply costs or even commercial costs. And that is positive. 
However, there's also risks, and risks such as further retailer inventory reductions, commodity inflation in categories where private label has had a lot of success like natural cheese, meat and coffee. But one observation that I can -- that I made early on is that from a seasonality standpoint, historically, Kraft Heinz usually earns 50% of the 50 -- at least 50% of the EBITDA in the first half of the year, but that's just an observation. So we'll see how we do."

So that's right that we're not providing guidance for the full year, so we're pulling guidance. But I can provide a little bit of color on our expectations for the full year without giving enough data point estimate for sales or EBITDA. 
So like I said before, we do expect to see better year-on-year performance on top and bottom line in the second half versus the first half. And some of the drivers are what's consistent with what we said in February, and there's some new potential risks to that as well. So what hasn't changed versus our expectations in February are continued retail takeaway that we've seen in the market with U.S. consumption up 1%, Canada consumption up 4% and that we expect to be -- continue to be supported by accelerated innovation in the back half. And we've also seen some promising growth globally in our Foodservice business as well. 
On top of that, we expect to see improved pricing trends in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half. And this will happen with some of the trade timing that we're lapping as well as the price increases in the U.S. that we implemented later in the first half that we'll fully lap in the second half as well. And then finally, on the positive side, as Miguel mentioned earlier, we do expect to see improving cost inflation as we start to lap some of the higher costs that we had in the second half of 2018. 
What has changed versus our expectations in February and as we progress through Q2, is we do see risks for further retail inventory reductions in the second half. Although we can't say what that may look like, we do see additional risk. And on top of that, we also see risk from accelerating key commodity inflation, particularly in the U.S. in meats and dairy. But we'll definitely try to manage via price but could be a risk to us in the second half. And then finally, we also have some potential adverse currency translation versus our expectations in February."

We need a strategy, first of all, for growth, which is critical. We need to find opportunities, find white spaces, what brands to invest, what channels today that we have lower share, what channels to divest more and structure for growth, what countries where we should attack and grow and invest on. And this will all be part of our strategy for growth. 
So examples, I was talking here with my colleagues that a country that I know very well, China. In China, we have a very good business on soy sauce. We are leaders in 2 of the provinces, Guandong and Fujian. They're 2 of the most -- the richest provinces. But we are only there. It's a business or it's an industry -- starts off as an industry of $12 billion, it grows 8% per year and we have great equity there. But we are just in 2 provinces. Big opportunities to grow outside of this provinces. There's a big opportunity to have other sauces, not only soy sauce. Why haven't we done it? I don't know exactly. But I see this as a big opportunity, it's a white space that we have to organize ourselves for growth. 
It's also mentality, it's mindset, that we have to do it. And to fund -- and we have to work on the other side to fund these growth initiatives. We have to be very efficient. We have to be more efficient than everybody else. And to tell you the truth, when I came and when arrived here, I was absolutely sure that I would find these opportunities for growth, I was not sure if we had the opportunities for efficiencies because I didn't know the business. And I -- today, I know that we have. 
But there are many other white spaces like in the West, talking about ethnicity. 20% of the population in America are Hispanics and represents 40% of the growth of the population. We don't have absolutely anything in our portfolio today to attend this population. We don't even communicate to the Hispanic community. That is an opportunity. 
So I'm looking at these opportunities everywhere from a brand standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from an ethnicity standpoint, from a country standpoint. And this will be only inputs that we will put in our strat plan that we'll present to our Board at the end of the year and to you at the beginning of next year. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question."

I would mention Heinz Ketchup, with the innovation that we had and the communication, is a very good example. Innovation to premiumize the brand, launching organic version, no added sugar, that we can charge more, that have higher margins. And that helps us well in the image of the brand. And that is a very good example of what to do. We put more money behind the brand and we achieve all-time share, achieving 70% share. That's a good example. 
So -- but on the other hand, again, as I said, I think we can do a much better job on focus on investments on core brands, not dilute at among a lot of brands and small brands. Do more innovation on big brands instead of launching too many new brands. Having innovation that is more incremental and not dilutive. I think we did a lot of brand extensions but not enough of a creative innovation. So there's the big homework to be done in marketing. I don't think everything is wrong at all.

Specifically on pricing, I think that on categories that we lead, we need to meet the pricing. And maybe in the past, it took us too much time to pass inflation and have suffered with that. I also think that pricing -- averages on pricing are dangerous because we have brands like Heinz Ketchup or like Philadelphia that industrial innovation -- or not innovation, we have been able to pass price. And we continue growing and we're achieving all-time highs market share. But of course, we have more pressure on categories where we have more competition from private label and where -- are more driven by commodities like cheese. 
So David mentioned before that, yes, one of the risks we have in the second half is because cheese -- the commodity of cheese is increasing dramatically, the price of cheese. And we have asking prices. And they are expecting private label to follow, but we don't know. We don't know if -- so that's a risk. So that would be my comments on pricing. 
But I would like to go beyond. I think opportunities in revenue management exists as well. I think we can do a better job of -- to maximize the discounts. Discount is a big investment. And I think we can be much better on allocating discounts by accounts, by product, throughout the year. Understand better what works and in what way and when and how.

So on the impairment side, first off, our impairment testing, as you know, occurs in Q2 every year. And so we performed our testing procedures this year after we filed the 10-K concurrent with preparing our Q1 and Q2 financial statements. And to reiterate, these are preliminary numbers that we disclosed in the 8-K. 
So the preliminary impairment charges in the first half were driven by 2 main factors. So first off, as you said, we did have revised expectations in response to current market factors in some of our international businesses that were evaluated during the first quarter of 2019 as we developed these 5-year plans. And as a reminder, these are the EMEA East reporting unit, LTA Exports reporting unit and Brazil where we had an impairment.
Secondly, we also had the application of a higher discount rate to reflect the sustained decline in our stock price since the start of the year. And so also, we should keep in mind that we did start the year with nearly $60 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles with less than 20% cushion relative to their carrying value. So what that means is there's going to be continued risk of future impairments, given any change in forecast or modeling assumption can particularly trigger that. 
And to answer your question specifically. As we kind of updated and developed these operating forecasts, we did have lower revenue and margin expectations, specifically for the 3 reporting units that I mentioned, EMEA East, Brazil and LTA Exports. The 6 brands that were impaired within Q2 were driven by the increased discount rate, which again was reflecting the sustained reduction in our stock price since the start of the year."

And I think this has been actually pretty good, arriving here with fresh eyes and asking questions that some were obvious but people were not asking themselves for a long time. Some were not obvious and they had not been asked about it before. And so this has been positive. 
I think that my experience in the past, both from leading global brands at ABI and using premiumization as a way to grow top line, were very interesting. When I was Head of Marketing, ABI has been growing substantially because of mix, because of premium brands, and I think, to me, this is an opportunity in the food industry. There is a big premiumization going on, but the premiumization actually is coming much more from the small players not from the big food players. But let me share with you another experience from my past that, I think, we can adapt here in -- at Kraft Heinz. 
I ran our business in Asia, and China has been the best story of organic growth for ABI. And the reason why we succeeded was because we understood the future of business in China better than anybody else. And we understood that the economic growth would bring huge premiumization, wealth, the channels would change -- night-life channel would grow immensely. And so we'd make all the best in the future. We'd make all the best in what would grow not what was big necessarily. And that happened. 
And making that parallel with Kraft Heinz, I think this is critical for us. Yes, we need to navigate through the present, but we need to give a strategy for the future. We need to define where this business is going to grow, where food is going to grow and be ahead of everybody else. In the case of China, we understood that much better even than the local brewers. We understood China better than them. And I think that, again, this what I was talking about the future before. If we understand the future and we lead the future, we're going to win. And the ones that will not understand will just follow. And I really want to be in the first group not in the second group.
So -- and as I said before, there's big transformation in food. Negative people would be afraid of that. I'm an optimistic by nature, and I believe that this transformation is an area of big opportunity. And the ones that will understand the future are the ones that are going to win, and we'll be those. 
Well, this was the last question. I just would like to finish by saying a couple of words maybe summarizing a little bit of what we talked during this call. 
I wanted to tell you, to reinforce, how excited and how delighted I am with the opportunity to take Kraft Heinz to the next level. I am, the way that you are, disappointed with the first half results, but I'm determined to rebuild our business momentum. I have our Board's support, and not only support, and expectation to set a new direction, a new forward. And for me, there are no sacred cows, no preconceived ideas, just fresh eyes and just thinking about what is best for our great company. 
I know there's a lot of headwinds, but I see also encouraging solid consumption trends that are very positive. But we must continue to work our portfolio, our strategy and invest strategically to put ourselves in a position for top line and bottom line growth. We need to improve our speed. We need to become absolutely obsessed with the consumer and understanding the future better than anybody else. We need to pivot from a cost-cutting mentality to a continuous improvement, efficiency-focused. And we need to strengthen the balance sheet. That remains a priority.
So thank you very much for your time. I'm delighted to be here with you today and really looking forward to knowing you personally and to be sharing our -- my views and to be learning from you as well. Thank you very much."

Well, first of all, I'm honored to be with you today as the new CEO of Kraft Heinz. As someone who has worked on some of the biggest brands in the world, I know intimately they have power in the marketplace and with consumers. Kraft Heinz has some of the globe's best roughly 200 brands in nearly 200 countries, with nearly 20 of them maintaining their relevance for 100 years or more. We are in 97% of American households today, holding the #1 or 2 spots in 50 categories. 
And I'm humbled to follow the great CEOs that have successfully adapted our brands and businesses through periods of tremendous change over more than 100 years. These are great assets for any business, but at Kraft Heinz, we have far bigger aspirations. That's why I wanted to be candid with you from the start of my tenure here. The valuation of our stock is now among the lowest in the industry, and you deserve straight talk from me about how this business is run. I pledge that to you today and for as long as I'm here. 
The entire Board has mandated a new approach to Kraft Heinz. As such, it's my job to tell you what we got wrong and why we got it wrong. Over the coming months, I will share more with you about how we'll fix it, but it starts right now with me and our entire senior management team. Our brands are icons, it's our job to ensure they are living icons.
To do that, we must understand the future so we can lead, not follow. We must understand the consumer better than any other company. We have a good start on being data and process-driven, but we must put more attention on deep consumer insights. For instance, we have sophisticated tools to tell quality meet impressions versus those that don't reach the consumer. But we are also the company that had the first plant-based burger, the Boca Burger, but find ourselves far behind the plant-based market today. 
Many of you believe our story as one of cost control and zero-based budgeting. These have been strengths for our company because they have enhanced our margins since the time of our merger. Without this discipline, we would be in a worse place today. But we have to do more than that. We need to change so we can apply strong, consistent investment in our brands. 
There is no doubt our industry is in such a big moment of transformation in retail, nontraditional channels, private label, premiumization, consumer values, health and well-being. Big transformation represents big opportunity, and we as an organization need to be at the forefront of this change. 
My first 40 days at Kraft Heinz have been rich in learning with honest and candid conversations with our global leaders, employees as well as our customers. I've held numerous town halls, had one-on-one with more than 300 employees and had the chance to visit all of our major offices around the world. 
Those conversations have left me with an enormous appreciation for the team that we have here at Kraft Heinz. Our team is hard-working and motivated to drive the next chapter of the business. And the consistent message I hear from them is that while they've been through a lot, they still have a strong desire to win. Their commitment to the company is why I'm privileged to be their leader. 
But before we get into my first impressions and thoughts on our path forward, I'm going to ask David to review our first half results."

First off, with the filing of forms 10-Q for both the first and second quarters, we expect to regain our current filer status with the SEC. The accounting review and audit process for our 10-K was a thorough and time-intensive effort, and we restated past periods for misstatements that have occurred over the past 4 fiscal years. 
Overall, the magnitude of adjustments to our historical numbers was a cumulative impact from 2015 to 2018 of less than 1% of net income. We are now taking extensive actions to improve internal policies and procedures and to strengthen internal controls, including over financial reporting.
To date, we have already implemented a comprehensive disciplinary plan for all employees found to have engaged in this conduct; enhanced our organization, augmenting our procurement finance teams with additional experienced professionals in the area of supplier contracts and related arrangements; as well as realigned reporting lines so procurement finance now reports directly to the finance organization; and have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls for financial reporting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed. 
We're also in the process of reassessing employees' KPIs and will be implementing checkpoints to evaluate the impact from significant changes in the environment as well as evaluating potential solutions to upgrade our procurement management software and deploying a comprehensive global procurement training program. 
Taking these steps to improve internal controls is of the utmost importance for our Board, Miguel and myself. It will continue to be a high priority for the organization going forward. And I would like to thank all parties for their support and dedication, especially our finance and legal teams, our Board of Directors, our financial partners, among others. 
Regarding our first half performance, overall, while our consumption and share trends continue to improve, our first half results were held back by actions at a number of our retail partners in both the U.S. and Canada to reduce the amount of inventory they carry. We continue to suffer from higher supply chain costs, and frankly, the absolute level of year-on-year declines in EBITDA and EPS are simply unacceptable. 
If you recall, in February, we set out priorities around improving our growth and returns by driving consumption and market share and leveraging in-store sales and e-commerce investments to build our brands and grow our categories. So far this year, our retail takeaway in both the United States and Canada has continued to grow and improve since the second half of 2018 and into the first half of 2019. 
In the United States, first half consumption in measured channels was up 1.1% versus the prior year with market share gains in more than half of our business. In Canada, retail sales consumption grew nearly 4% in the first half, although this was aided by a return to a more normal promotional calendar versus the prior year. And we've continued our strong push on condiments and sauces around the world with significant advertising and merchandising activity behind the Heinz 150-year anniversary. But on the whole, we are dissatisfied with our financial performance year-to-date as well as the fact that retailer inventory reductions dampened our potential for the first half and the full year.
In terms of sales for the first half, we outlined in February the sources of our organic net sales decline. These included unfavorable promotional timing in both the United States and Canada as well as difficult comparisons versus an exceptionally strong prior year in U.K. soups. In addition to that, we also saw a negative impact from lower inventory levels at retail in North America that we did not anticipate, as well as lost sales due to trade negotiations in parts of Continental Europe as we implemented good, better, best pricing in ketchup between our Heinz and newly repatriated Kraft brands.
From a total company perspective, organic net sales were down 1.5% in the first half, including an adverse impact of approximately 1.2 percentage points from retail inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Volume mix was relatively flat in the first half as the reduction in retail inventory levels more than offset consumption growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America. 
Pricing was negative, down 1.3 percentage points, driven by 3 factors. The first factor driving lower pricing was unfavorable timing of promotional expense, representing a roughly 80 basis point decrease in price on a global basis, including approximately 90 basis points in the U.S. In the U.S., while we expected promotional timing to be a source of year-over-year decline in the first half, it should turn favorable in the second half of the year and therefore relatively neutral for the full year. By contrast, the step-up in Canada reflects greater activity versus last year, including the natural cheese business that we just sold and it's not likely to reverse in the second half. 
The second factor was key commodity-driven pricing in North America, representing a roughly 30 basis point drag on global pricing in the first half. And third, the remainder primarily reflects continued promotional support behind select U.S. categories, mainly in our Lunchables and frozen categories. 
With respect to profitability, we spoke about our first quarter and indeed our first half being up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year. This reflected our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up fixed cost investments and retail channel growth, marketing and our people as well as pricing not beginning to take effect until the second quarter. 
In the end, the cost inflation picture, while improving, remains unfavorable versus the prior year across packaging, manufacturing and logistics in the United States. And this, together with stepped-up fixed cost investments, drove roughly half of the constant currency production and first half EBITDA we saw versus the prior year. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, the decline we saw in the first half reflected lower adjusted EBITDA as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses versus the prior year period. Other income and our effective tax rate versus the first half of 2018 were more favorable than we expected, such that in total, the [ low-growth ] items were a $0.02 benefit to adjusted EPS versus the first 6 months of 2018. 
From a forward-looking perspective, we have now completed the 2 divestitures we previously announced, India nutritional beverages and Canada natural cheese. These divestitures resulted in a combined after-tax proceeds of more than $1.5 billion, and we remain committed to using those proceeds to further deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet. 
However, I will highlight here that with regard to our effective tax rate, we continue to expect roughly 21% for the full year. The first half was only 18.4% due to the timing of discrete items, but this benefit is not expected to repeat, resulting in a higher rate in the second half, especially in Q3. 
And for the second half of 2019 specifically, we continue to expect to see an improvement in year-over-year top and bottom line growth rates versus what we saw in the first half. This should be driven by continued momentum in consumer uptake and more innovation coming to market; improved pricing trends, particularly as our price increases in the U.S. take hold; and lapping some of the stepped-up fixed costs and cost inflation that we saw in the back half of last year. Although I would note that we are seeing risk from further reductions in retail or inventory levels as well as accelerating key commodity costs in the U.S. that we had not anticipated at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back to Miguel."
278212,631499350,1829801,"The Kraft Heinz Company, H1 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2019",2019-08-08,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point,",1549,"Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point, I think it's important to make a candid assessment of where I think we are today.
At the outset, I shared many of the concerns that a good number of you have expressed over things like brand support, supply chain execution, the sustainability of our profits and just how long it would take to be in the position to start growing both the top line and the bottom lines. And now our Board of Directors made it clear that they wanted to bring change in light of the company's recent missteps and have given me their full support to contemplate any path that will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. 
So far, I have found, as you might expect, things that are rarely as bad or as good as what you read from the outside. What is clear is that we win when we strongly and consistently invest in our brands. For instance, thanks to innovations and investments to extend a 150-year-old brand into new segments, Heinz achieved an all-time high market share in U.S. ketchup, reaching 70% in the second quarter. And Philadelphia has consistently grown share and grown the category year-over-year since 2014 with a 68% share year-to-date by setting the standard for superior quality and taste.
We have also built a world-class quality organization that has had the fewest recalls in the food industry over the past 4 years. Since 2015, we invested more than $1 billion of CapEx in North America alone, including significant investments on the end of the line for detection, risk avoidance and consumer complaint mitigation. These are just some examples of great things I've seen at the company in my early days. But it's also important to face the cold, hard facts and assess where we have had shortfalls. 
First and foremost, the company had a significant decline in adjusted EBITDA margins from a peak of 29.4% in the fiscal 2017 to roughly 24.5% for the trailing 12 months through the end of June this year. This was driven by a combination of inflation in our supply chain, including packaging freight over time and maintenance costs as well as significant step-up in fixed costs to support sales growth with price increases lagging higher costs.
Regarding our supply chain problems in 2018, it's clear we lost forecast accuracy and our ability to execute productivity initiatives to offset market inflation. I believe we persisted with integration-minded cost-cutting and did not pivot to a continuous-improvement productivity-driven mindset soon enough. 
Before I arrived, the company started to take actions to make sure this doesn't happen again, but I see opportunity to go further by bringing in more technical expertise in critical areas, by improving collaboration and process between our category and supply chain teams, by doing a better job of understanding root causes of supply chain losses. And this needs to be supported by our finance team, leading a cross-functional effort to improve visibility. 
So one of my main priorities now and going forward is to make sure we have a much better visibility in our supply chain as well as more robust ongoing productivity initiatives. I believe this critical part of the company should and can generate significant productivity. If we have the proper visibility, we can build a solid pipeline of efficiencies-oriented initiatives across our value chain.
Moving to our fixed costs or SG&A. Since 2015, we have taken out significant costs from the business. We also reinvested roughly $300 million last year in areas like people, go-to-market capabilities, marketing and innovation. To be honest, it's too early for me to tell which investments will generate the returns we expect, but my experience tells me that whenever there are a lot of big investments in such a short period of time, it's difficult to see all of them working at once. 
It's therefore critical that we prioritize the ones that are working and that fit the strategic agenda that we are currently developing. And for the investments that are not working, we move those dollars to areas that may need more investment. As examples, I believe our investments in media remain low despite fixed costs and overall marketing spend increasing over the past 2 years.
On the brand and innovation side, we need to become more consumer-obsessed so we can better predict their behavior even before they know it. There are practices that need to change in the product development process so we can be faster and more consumer centric with our new products. And we need to better balance spending on market innovations versus core brand support.
And in terms of retail channel development, Kraft Heinz has grown rapidly and has had strong share performance in e-commerce that we really need to take a step back and develop a longer-term outlook of the channel growth and how Kraft Heinz can win and assess the incrementality of each customer. So it's not just about cutting costs, it's becoming more about efficiency and making dollars already in our base work harder elsewhere. 
Let me turn now to my priorities and the opportunities I see ahead of us. When I became CEO last month, I established 3 immediate goals with the Board: the first, which should be obvious, is to get to know our business, our consumers, our customers and my colleagues; the second is to execute our existing 2019 business plan; and the third and most important is to lead a comprehensive review to develop a new strategic agenda for the next 3 to 5 years. 
It is critical that we get the organization to concentrate on setting our strategic direction and laying the foundation for our future now. We need to ask ourselves the hard questions about our business, not thinking about the short term or next quarter. And we need to take the time to seek out external and internal inspiration and build on best practices, both within Kraft Heinz and from other world-class brands. 
From a financial perspective, we do expect many of the top and bottom line factors that held back the first half to fade in the second half. But I've asked David that we not provide or update specific point estimate financial guidance. Setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities. 
In addition, as I'm learning the business and develop our strategic agenda, I want us to spend more time evaluating the questions of divestitures. We absolutely remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating, but our more urgent priority is to get the organization fixated on our consumers and customers, and in this process, ensure we don't rush to give away potential value to others. We have already started the work and taken some early actions to put in place the right team and the right structure to help achieve my 3 immediate priorities. 
As you may have seen, my first act as CEO was to make some changes in our structure to help accelerate our progress. First, I have taken on the U.S. president role on an interim basis. U.S. represents 70% of our company and this will help me understand our business, consumers and the customers faster. For me, this deep dive is an essential step to developing the right plan that drives sustainable growth and shareholder value for Kraft Heinz. 
I also established a new role, International Zone President for Kraft Heinz, combining our EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American zones, representing 20% of our global business. We did this to create a streamlined, more robust international structure to find commonalities, define their strategy and drive the business with greater speed. We will continue to share more of our approach to the strategic agenda over the coming quarters. We expect to complete our work by the year-end and anticipate sharing our conclusions with you early next year.
As we do with this plan, my experience has shown that to truly change the momentum of a business, we must understand the future, identifying where the consumer, their needs and the marketplace are headed, and then invest quickly and consistently to make sure our core brands will serve those needs better than the competition. Further, I believe we can and must find internal efficiencies, whether in our supply chain or fixed cost base that have both increased substantially in the last 2 years that can help to fund the strategy. 
Intense discipline is a virtue, but it's not an end in itself. I believe great companies are the ones that keep expenses under control so they can use the capital for new investments that grow both the top line and the bottom line. It's not one or the other. And as I look ahead, I'm very excited about the opportunities at Kraft Heinz. Similar to my attention to consumers, customers and colleagues, I also look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and quarters. 
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

But I think that the heritage that we have in the brands, the household penetration that we have, the awareness that we have makes me feel very positive about the possibility of turning around some of the trends that we have in the brands that are not doing as well. I also think that we have a great scale, and that is a big competitive advantage in America. And I'm also very, very excited about the possibility of turning the business around. I've done it before in my life, and I think that it is possible. 
Now to take a business around, I think it's critical that we define comprehensive strategy, and this strategy has to be based on understanding the future, understanding the consumer. I believe that if we -- that the industry is in a huge transformation today, and transformation is also a moment of opportunity. And the ones that are going to take this opportunity are the ones that will understand the future better than the others, so then we'll lead.

Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest more, especially in our people and our brands. I think that, as I said before, that our media investments are below where they should be. But before going",280,"Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest more, especially in our people and our brands. I think that, as I said before, that our media investments are below where they should be. But before going after new investments, I would really look at the possibility of inefficiencies in the system so I can reorganize and redeploy these investments. I'm still -- of course, it's early to talk about it, but I'm seeing a lot of inefficiencies, and these for me are big opportunities. 
I'll give you just 2 examples so I'm not so theoretical. In marketing, Andrew, we increased investments in the last 2 years. But in media, we've been declining. We grew investments or we put money behind many other things, agency fees, production, research, product development. But the things that the consumer really sees, we declined to pay the other expense. These for me are inefficiencies that we can redeploy. 
I'll give you another example. Maybe because of all the complexity that we put in the system, our supply chain losses have been increasing, actually, double digits in the last years. That's not acceptable. We need to understand very well the root causes of these supply chain losses and that's to reduce them. These are losses that can be converted in investments. So just 2 examples of inefficiencies that I see very early here in my job, and this has to be my focus. Before talking about new investments and reducing the margin, I would -- I'm going after inefficiencies that I can put back in the system to feed the growth, and I'm seeing that."

So Chris, let me go back a little bit in time at Kraft Heinz. I think that when you put 2 companies together, the first cycle -- or first phase or the first cycle has to be really about bringing in new culture and extract inefficiencies. And I think that the company did a good job on that. We extracted a lot of efficiencies. We cut a lot of costs. But then after 2 years, it's hard to continue cutting costs. You need to change the strategy or you need to change the path. 
The first year, you have 2 CEOs. You cut 1 CEO, that's a cost cutting. But the following year, you don't have another CEO to cut. Cost cutting is a one-off activity and is necessary when you have the opportunity. But then you have to move and you have to think about how do you reduce costs but in a different way. And that way is, really, you have to change the way of operating the business. It's about efficiencies. It's about making better every day forever. You need to change the mindset. And if you continue cutting costs, you can get in trouble. 
I think that this second phase starts now with me. Yes, it could have started before. And I think the company would have benefit from that, but it didn't. And so it's time now with me, and I'm going to put a big emphasis on that. Not on cost cutting, but on efficiencies in the system, extracting efficiencies from the system, making better every day, making our factories much more efficient, making our execution in sales much better, making our market investments, as I mentioned before, much better as well, so we invest on things that the consumers see, not on the consumer doesn't see, et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question, Chris."

So like Miguel said, we're not providing point estimate guidance, but I can give some additional color on some of the items below the line. 
So we continue to expect up to $0.25 of unfavorability below our adjusted EBITDA line for the full year relative to 2018, and this negative impact will be greater in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half for a couple of different reasons. First off, the largest driver is tax. We had some discrete benefits in the first half, whereas we expect some discrete costs within the back half of the year. 
Second, we did see some FX favorability in the first half in other income that may flip in the second half. Third, related to incentive-based comp, we'll have a significant expense in the second half of the year, and this is due to the timing of the delayed filings of our 10-K and our 10-Qs, whereas we typically expect that to happen in the first half of the full year. And then finally, we may see some higher interest expense in the second half as well."

I want to go further a little bit and tell you why. I think that, first, because I believe that for Kraft Heinz, now we need -- what we don't need is to be focused on internal -- on product targets on the short term. We have a big agenda to build. We have a second half to deliver. But I think that working on structure and targets will not help. 
But second, since I've been here just for 40 days, I wouldn't feel comfortable about giving a guidance that I still do not have the necessary confidence about that number. I'm not sure if I'm going to overachieve by second half, if I'm going to underachieve or I will achieve. When -- in this situation, when managers look at the leaders always with empty pockets, right, like they don't know me yet. But what I know is that in the second half, some of the pressures that we had in the first half will fade, pressures like supply costs or even commercial costs. And that is positive. 
However, there's also risks, and risks such as further retailer inventory reductions, commodity inflation in categories where private label has had a lot of success like natural cheese, meat and coffee. But one observation that I can -- that I made early on is that from a seasonality standpoint, historically, Kraft Heinz usually earns 50% of the 50 -- at least 50% of the EBITDA in the first half of the year, but that's just an observation. So we'll see how we do."

So that's right that we're not providing guidance for the full year, so we're pulling guidance. But I can provide a little bit of color on our expectations for the full year without giving enough data point estimate for sales or EBITDA. 
So like I said before, we do expect to see better year-on-year performance on top and bottom line in the second half versus the first half. And some of the drivers are what's consistent with what we said in February, and there's some new potential risks to that as well. So what hasn't changed versus our expectations in February are continued retail takeaway that we've seen in the market with U.S. consumption up 1%, Canada consumption up 4% and that we expect to be -- continue to be supported by accelerated innovation in the back half. And we've also seen some promising growth globally in our Foodservice business as well. 
On top of that, we expect to see improved pricing trends in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half. And this will happen with some of the trade timing that we're lapping as well as the price increases in the U.S. that we implemented later in the first half that we'll fully lap in the second half as well. And then finally, on the positive side, as Miguel mentioned earlier, we do expect to see improving cost inflation as we start to lap some of the higher costs that we had in the second half of 2018. 
What has changed versus our expectations in February and as we progress through Q2, is we do see risks for further retail inventory reductions in the second half. Although we can't say what that may look like, we do see additional risk. And on top of that, we also see risk from accelerating key commodity inflation, particularly in the U.S. in meats and dairy. But we'll definitely try to manage via price but could be a risk to us in the second half. And then finally, we also have some potential adverse currency translation versus our expectations in February."

We need a strategy, first of all, for growth, which is critical. We need to find opportunities, find white spaces, what brands to invest, what channels today that we have lower share, what channels should I invest more and structure for growth, what countries where we should attack and grow and vest on. And this will all be part of our strategy for growth. 
So examples, I was talking here with my colleagues that a country that I know very well, China. In China, we have a very good business on soy sauce. We are leaders in 2 of the provinces, Guandong and Fujian. They're 2 of the most -- the richest provinces. But we are only there. It's a business or it's an industry -- starts off as an industry of $12 billion, it grows 8% per year and we have great equity there. But we are just in 2 provinces. Big opportunities to grow outside of this provinces. There's a big opportunity to have other sauces, not only soy sauce. Why haven't we done it? I don't know exactly. But I see this as a big opportunity, it's a white space that we have to organize ourselves for growth. 
It's also mentality, it's mindset, that we have to do it. And to fund -- and we have to work on the other side to fund these growth initiatives. We have to be very efficient. We have to be more efficient than everybody else. And to tell you the truth, when I came and when arrived here, I was absolutely sure that I would find these opportunities for growth, I was not sure if we had the opportunities for efficiencies because I didn't know the business. And I -- today, I know that we have. 
But there are many other white spaces like in the West, talking about ethnicity. 20% of the population in America are Hispanics and represents 40% of the growth of the population. We don't have absolutely anything in our portfolio today to attend this population. We don't even communicate to the Hispanic community. That is an opportunity. 
So I'm looking at these opportunities everywhere from a brand standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from an ethnicity standpoint, from a country standpoint. And this will be only inputs that we will put in our strat plan that we'll present to our Board at the end of the year and to you at the beginning of next year. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question."

So this is one part, and we are putting things in place, the present working on simple things, which is basically execution. We are in a much better place. 
Now for the future, what we did was to open a front, both with inside and outside or external people or talent, to help us define what is this map for efficiencies for the future. We opened 8 fronts that go from supply chain losses to service level, that go to people, that go to costs, is there productivity on the lines. And these are not -- it's not a project, this will be a way of living. We've been too focused on the present and literally on firefighting. If there's a fire there, let's extinguish the fire.

Innovation to premiumize the brand, launching organic version, no added sugar, that we can charge more, that have higher margins. And that helps us well the image of the brand. And that is a very good example of what to do. We put more money behind the brand and we achieve all-time share, achieving 70% share. That's a good example. 
So -- but on the other hand, again, as I said, I think we can do a much better job on focus on investments on core brands, not dilute at among a lot of brands and small brands. Do more innovation on big brands instead of launching too many new brands. Have the innovation that is more incremental and not dilutive. I think we did a lot of brand extensions but not enough of a creative innovation. So there's the big homework to be done in marketing. I don't think everything is wrong at all.

Specifically on pricing, I think that on categories that we lead, we need to meet the pricing. And maybe in the past, it took us too much time to pass inflation and we suffered with that. I also think that pricing -- averages on pricing are dangerous because we have brands like Heinz Ketchup or like Philadelphia that industrial innovation -- or not innovation, we have been able to pass price. And we continue growing and we're achieving all-time highs market share. But of course, we have more pressure on categories where we have more competition from private label and where -- are more driven by commodities like cheese. 
So David mentioned before that, yes, one of the risks we have in the second half is because cheese -- the commodity of cheese is increasing dramatically, the price of cheese. And we have asking prices. And they are expecting private label to follow, but we don't know. We don't know if -- so that's a risk. So that would be my comments on pricing. 
But I would like to go beyond. I think opportunities in revenue management exists as well. I think we can do a better job of -- to maximize the discounts. Discount is a big investment. And I think we can be much better on allocating discounts by accounts, by product, throughout the year. Understand better what works and in what way and when and how.

Thanks for the question. So on the impairment side, first off, our impairment testing, as you know, occurs in Q2 every year.

So on the impairment side, first off, our impairment testing, as you know, occurs in Q2 every year. And so we performed our testing procedures this year after we filed the 10-K concurrent with preparing our Q1 and Q2 financial statements. And to reiterate, these are preliminary numbers that we disclosed in the 8-K. 
So the preliminary impairment charges in the first half were driven by 2 main factors. So first off, as you said, we did have revised expectations in response to current market factors in some of our international businesses that were evaluated during the first quarter of 2019 as we developed these 5-year plans. And as a reminder, these are the EMEA East reporting unit, LTA Exports reporting unit and Brazil where we had an impairment.
Secondly, we also had the application of a higher discount rate to reflect the sustained decline in our stock price since the start of the year. And so also, we should keep in mind that we did start the year with nearly $60 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles with less than 20% cushion relative to their carrying value. So what that means is there's going to be continued risk of future impairments, given any change in forecast or modeling assumption can particularly trigger that. 
And to answer your question specifically. As we kind of updated and developed these operating forecasts, we did have lower revenue and margin expectations, specifically for the 3 reporting units that I mentioned, EMEA East, Brazil and LTA Exports. The 6 brands that were impaired within Q2 were driven by the increased discount rate, which again was reflecting the sustained reduction in our stock price since the start of the year."

Now talking",773,"Okay. Steve, look, we'll update you throughout -- or through the rest of the year on how strategic work is going, but it's our intention to share with our Board at the end of the year and then sharing with you at the beginning of next year. 
Now talking a little bit about my experience with food or with beer and how this has -- can be adapted to food. I think there are a lot of similarities, but there are a lot of differences as well. And I think this has been actually pretty good, arriving here with fresh eyes and asking questions that some were obvious but people were not asking themselves for a long time. Some were not obvious and they had not been asked about it before. And so this has been positive. 
I think that my experience in the past, both from leading global brands at ABI and using premiumization as a way to grow top line, were very interesting. When I was Head of Marketing, ABI has been growing substantially because of mix, because of premium brands, and I think, actually, this is an opportunity in the food industry. There is a big premiumization going on, but the premiumization actually is coming much more from the small players not from the big food players. But let me share with you another experience from my past that, I think, we can adapt here in -- at Kraft Heinz. 
I ran our business in Asia, and China has been the best story of organic growth for ABI. And the reason why we succeeded was because we understood the future of business in China better than anybody else. And we understood that the economic growth would bring huge premiumization, wealth, the channels would change -- night-life channel would grow immensely. And so we'd make all the best in the future. We'd make all the best in what would grow not what was big necessarily. And that happened. 
And making that parallel with Kraft Heinz, I think this is critical for us. Yes, we need to navigate through the present, but we need to give a strategy for the future. We need to define where this business is going to grow, where food is going to grow and be ahead of everybody else. In the case of China, we understood that much better even than the local brewers. We understood China better than them. And I think that, again, this what I was talking about the future before. If we understand the future and we lead the future, we're going to win. And the ones that will not understand will just follow. And I really want to be in the first group not in the second group.
So -- and as I said before, there's big transformation in food. Negative people would be afraid of that. I'm an optimistic by nature, and I believe that this transformation is an area of big opportunity. And the ones that will understand the future are the ones that are going to win, and we'll be those. 
Well, this was the last question. I just would like to finish just by saying a couple of words maybe summarizing a little bit of what we talked during this call. 
I wanted to tell you, to reinforce, how excited and how delighted I am with the opportunity to take Kraft Heinz to the next level. I am, the way that you are, disappointed with the first half results, but I'm determined to rebuild our business momentum. I have our Board's support, and not only support, and expectation to set a new direction, a new forward. And for me, there are no sacred cows, no preconceived ideas, just fresh eyes and just thinking about what is best for our great company. 
I know there's a lot of headwinds, but I see also encouraging solid consumption trends that are very positive. But we must continue to work our portfolio, our strategy and invest strategically to put ourselves in a position for top line and bottom line growth. We need to improve our speed. We need to become absolutely obsessed with the consumer and understanding the future better than anybody else. We need to pivot from a cost-cutting mentality to a continuous improvement, efficiency-focused. And we need to strengthen the balance sheet. That remains a priority.
So thank you very much for your time. I'm delighted to be here with you today and really looking forward to knowing you personally and to be sharing our -- my views and to be learning from you as well. Thank you very much."

Well, first of all, I'm honored to be with you today as the new CEO of Kraft Heinz. As someone who has worked on some of the biggest brands in the world, I know intimately they have power in the marketplace and with consumers. Kraft Heinz has some of the globe's best roughly 200 brands in nearly 200 countries, with nearly 20 of them maintaining their relevance for 100 years or more. We are in 97% of American households today, holding the #1 or 2 spots in 50 categories. 
And I'm humbled to follow the great CEOs that have successfully adapted our brands and businesses through periods of tremendous change over more than 100 years. These are great assets for any business, but at Kraft Heinz, we have far bigger aspirations. That's why I wanted to be candid with you from the start of my tenure here. The valuation of our stock is now among the lowest in the industry, and you deserve straight talk from me about how this business is run. I pledge that to you today and for as long as I'm here. 
The entire Board has mandated a new approach to Kraft Heinz. As such, it's my job to tell you what we got wrong and why we got it wrong. Over the coming months, I will share more with you about how we'll fix it, but it starts right now with me and our entire senior management team. Our brands are icons, it's our job to ensure they are living icons.
To do that, we must understand the future so we can lead, not follow. We must understand the consumer better than any other company. We have a good start on being data and process-driven, but we must put more attention on deep consumer insights. For instance, we have sophisticated tools to tell quality meet impressions versus those that don't reach the consumer. But we are also the company that had the first plant-based burger, the Boca Burger, but find ourselves far behind the plant-based market today. 
Many of you believe our story as one of cost control and zero-based budgeting. These have been strengths for our company because they have enhanced our margins since the time of our merger. Without this discipline, we would be in a worse place today. But we have to do more than that. We need to change so we can apply strong, consistent investment in our brands. 
There is no doubt our industry is in such a big moment of transformation in retail, nontraditional channels, private label, premiumization, consumer values, health and well-being. Big transformation represents big opportunity, and we as an organization need to be at the forefront of this change. 
My first 40 days at Kraft Heinz have been rich in learning with honest and candid conversations with our global leaders, employees as well as our customers. I've held numerous town halls, had one-on-one with more than 300 employees and had the chance to visit all of our major offices around the world. 
Those conversations have left me with an enormous appreciation for the team that we have here at Kraft Heinz. Our team is hard-working and motivated to drive the next chapter of the business. And the consistent message I hear from them is that while they've been through a lot, they still have a strong desire to win. Their commitment to the company is why I'm privileged to be their leader. 
But before we get into my first impressions and thoughts on our path forward, I'm going to ask David to review our first half results."

First off, with the filing of forms 10-Q for both the first and second quarters, we expect to regain our current filer status with the SEC. The accounting review and audit process for our 10-K was a thorough and time-intensive effort, and we restated past periods for misstatements that have occurred over the past 4 fiscal years. 
Overall, the magnitude of adjustments to our historical numbers was a cumulative impact from 2015 to 2018 of less than 1% of net income. We are now taking extensive actions to improve internal policies and procedures and to strengthen internal controls, including over financial reporting.
To date, we have already implemented a comprehensive disciplinary plan for all employees found to have engaged in this conduct; enhanced our organization, augmenting our procurement finance teams with additional experienced professionals in the area of supplier contracts and related arrangements; as well as realigned reporting lines so procurement finance now reports directly to the finance organization; and have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls for financial reporting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed. 
We're also in the process of reassessing employees' KPIs and will be implementing checkpoints to evaluate the impact from significant changes in the environment as well as evaluating potential solutions to upgrade our procurement management software and deploying a comprehensive global procurement training program. 
Taking these steps to improve internal controls is of the utmost importance for our Board, Miguel and myself. It will continue to be a high priority for the organization going forward. And I would like to thank all parties for their support and dedication, especially our finance and legal teams, our Board of Directors, our financial partners, among others. 
Regarding our first half performance, overall, while our consumption and share trends continue to improve, our first half results were held back by actions at a number of our retail partners in both the U.S. and Canada to reduce the amount of inventory they carry. We continue to suffer from higher supply chain costs, and frankly, the absolute level of year-on-year declines in EBITDA and EPS are simply unacceptable. 
If you recall, in February, we set out priorities around improving our growth and returns by driving consumption and market share and leveraging in-store sales and e-commerce investments to build our brands and grow our categories. So far this year, our retail takeaway in both the United States and Canada has continued to grow and improve since the second half of 2018 and into the first half of 2019. 
In the United States, first half consumption in measured channels was up 1.1% versus the prior year with market share gains in more than half of our business. In Canada, retail sales consumption grew nearly 4% in the first half, although this was aided by a return to a more normal promotional calendar versus the prior year. And we've continued our strong push on condiments and sauces around the world with significant advertising and merchandising activity behind the Heinz 150-year anniversary. But on the whole, we are dissatisfied with our financial performance year-to-date as well as the fact that retailer inventory reductions dampened our potential for the first half and the full year.
In terms of sales for the first half, we outlined in February the sources of our organic net sales decline. These included unfavorable promotional timing in both the United States and Canada as well as difficult comparisons versus an exceptionally strong prior year in U.K. soups. In addition to that, we also saw a negative impact from lower inventory levels at retail in North America that we did not anticipate, as well as lost sales due to trade negotiations in parts of Continental Europe as we implemented good, better, best pricing in ketchup between our Heinz and newly repatriated Kraft brands.
From a total company perspective, organic net sales were down 1.5% in the first half, including an adverse impact of approximately 1.2 percentage points from retail inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Volume mix was relatively flat in the first half as the reduction in retail inventory levels more than offset consumption growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America. 
Pricing was negative, down 1.3 percentage points, driven by 3 factors. The first factor driving lower pricing was unfavorable timing of promotional expense, representing a roughly 80 basis point decrease in price on a global basis, including approximately 90 basis points in the U.S. In the U.S., while we expected promotional timing to be a source of year-over-year decline in the first half, it should turn favorable in the second half of the year and therefore relatively neutral for the full year. By contrast, the step-up in Canada reflects greater activity versus last year, including the natural cheese business that we just sold and it's not likely to reverse in the second half. 
The second factor was key commodity-driven pricing in North America, representing a roughly 30 basis point drag on global pricing in the first half. And third, the remainder primarily reflects continued promotional support behind select U.S. categories, mainly in our Lunchables and frozen categories. 
With respect to profitability, we spoke about our first quarter and indeed our first half being up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year. This reflected our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up fixed cost investments and retail channel growth, marketing and our people as well as pricing not beginning to take effect until the second quarter. 
In the end, the cost inflation picture, while improving, remains unfavorable versus the prior year across packaging, manufacturing and logistics in the United States. And this, together with stepped-up fixed cost investments, drove roughly half of the constant currency production and first half EBITDA we saw versus the prior year. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, the decline we saw in the first half reflected lower adjusted EBITDA as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses versus the prior year period. Other income and our effective tax rate versus the first half of 2018 were more favorable than we expected, such that in total, the [ low-growth ] items were a $0.02 benefit to adjusted EPS versus the first 6 months of 2018. 
From a forward-looking perspective, we have now completed the 2 divestitures we previously announced, India nutritional beverages and Canada natural cheese. These divestitures resulted in a combined after-tax proceeds of more than $1.5 billion, and we remain committed to using those proceeds to further deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet. 
However, I will highlight here that with regard to our effective tax rate, we continue to expect roughly 21% for the full year. The first half was only 18.4% due to the timing of discrete items, but this benefit is not expected to repeat, resulting in a higher rate in the second half, especially in Q3. 
And for the second half of 2019 specifically, we continue to expect to see an improvement in year-over-year top and bottom line growth rates versus what we saw in the first half. This should be driven by continued momentum in consumer uptake and more innovation coming to market; improved pricing trends, particularly as our price increases in the U.S. take hold; and lapping some of the stepped-up fixed costs and cost inflation that we saw in the back half of last year. Although I would note that we are seeing risk from further reductions in retail or inventory levels as well as accelerating key commodity costs in the U.S. that we had not anticipated at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn it back to Miguel."
278212,631499350,1829802,"The Kraft Heinz Company, H1 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2019",2019-08-08,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point,",1549,"Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point, I think it's important to make a candid assessment of where I think we are today.
At the outset, I shared many of the concerns that a good number of you have expressed over things like brand support, supply chain execution, the sustainability of our profits and just how long it would take to be in the position to start growing both the top line and the bottom lines. And now our Board of Directors made it clear that they wanted to bring change in light of the company's recent missteps and have given me their full support to contemplate any path that will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. 
So far, I have found, as you might expect, things that are rarely as bad or as good as what you read from the outside. What is clear is that we win when we strongly and consistently invest in our brands. For instance, thanks to innovations and investments to extend a 150-year-old brand into new segments, Heinz achieved an all-time high market share in U.S. ketchup, reaching 70% in the second quarter. And Philadelphia has consistently grown share and grown the category year-over-year since 2014 with a 68% share year-to-date by setting the standard for superior quality and taste.
We have also built a world-class quality organization that has had the fewest recalls in the food industry over the past 4 years. Since 2015, we invested more than $1 billion of CapEx in North America alone, including significant investments on the end of the line for detection, risk avoidance and consumer complaint mitigation. These are just some examples of great things I've seen at the company in my early days. But it's also important to face the cold, hard facts and assess where we have had shortfalls. 
First and foremost, the company had a significant decline in adjusted EBITDA margins from a peak of 29.4% in the fiscal 2017 to roughly 24.5% for the trailing 12 months through the end of June this year. This was driven by a combination of inflation in our supply chain, including packaging freight over time and maintenance costs as well as significant step-up in fixed costs to support sales growth with price increases lagging higher costs.
Regarding our supply chain problems in 2018, it's clear we lost forecast accuracy and our ability to execute productivity initiatives to offset market inflation. I believe we persisted with integration-minded cost-cutting and did not pivot to a continuous-improvement productivity-driven mindset soon enough. 
Before I arrived, the company started to take actions to make sure this doesn't happen again, but I see opportunity to go further by bringing in more technical expertise in critical areas, by improving collaboration and process between our category and supply chain teams, by doing a better job of understanding root causes of supply chain losses. And this needs to be supported by our finance team, leading a cross-functional effort to improve visibility. 
So one of my main priorities now and going forward is to make sure we have a much better visibility in our supply chain as well as more robust ongoing productivity initiatives. I believe this critical part of the company should and can generate significant productivity. If we have the proper visibility, we can build a solid pipeline of efficiencies-oriented initiatives across our value chain.
Moving to our fixed costs or SG&A. Since 2015, we have taken out significant costs from the business. We also reinvested roughly $300 million last year in areas like people, go-to-market capabilities, marketing and innovation. To be honest, it's too early for me to tell which investments will generate the returns we expect, but my experience tells me that whenever there are a lot of big investments in such a short period of time, it's difficult to see all of them working at once. 
It's therefore critical that we prioritize the ones that are working and that fit the strategic agenda that we are currently developing. And for the investments that are not working, we move those dollars to areas that may need more investment. As examples, I believe our investments in media remain low despite fixed costs and overall marketing spend increasing over the past 2 years.
On the brand and innovation side, we need to become more consumer-obsessed so we can better predict their behavior even before they know it. There are practices that need to change in the product development process so we can be faster and more consumer centric with our new products. And we need to better balance spending on market innovations versus core brand support.
And in terms of retail channel development, Kraft Heinz has grown rapidly and has had strong share performance in e-commerce that we really need to take a step back and develop a longer-term outlook of the channel growth and how Kraft Heinz can win and assess the incrementality of each customer. So it's not just about cutting costs, it's becoming more about efficiency and making dollars already in our base work harder elsewhere. 
Let me turn now to my priorities and the opportunities I see ahead of us. When I became CEO last month, I established 3 immediate goals with the Board: the first, which should be obvious, is to get to know our business, our consumers, our customers and my colleagues; the second is to execute our existing 2019 business plan; and the third and most important is to lead a comprehensive review to develop a new strategic agenda for the next 3 to 5 years. 
It is critical that we get the organization to concentrate on setting our strategic direction and laying the foundation for our future now. We need to ask ourselves the hard questions about our business, not thinking about the short term or next quarter. And we need to take the time to seek out external and internal inspiration and build on best practices, both within Kraft Heinz and from other world-class brands. 
From a financial perspective, we do expect many of the top and bottom line factors that held back the first half to fade in the second half. But I've asked David that we not provide or update specific point estimate financial guidance. Setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities. 
In addition, as I'm learning the business and develop our strategic agenda, I want us to spend more time evaluating the questions of divestitures. We absolutely remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating, but our more urgent priority is to get the organization fixated on our consumers and customers, and in this process, ensure we don't rush to give away potential value to others. We have already started the work and taken some early actions to put in place the right team and the right structure to help achieve my 3 immediate priorities. 
As you may have seen, my first act as CEO was to make some changes in our structure to help accelerate our progress. First, I have taken on the U.S. president role on an interim basis. U.S. represents 70% of our company and this will help me understand our business, consumers and the customers faster. For me, this deep dive is an essential step to developing the right plan that drives sustainable growth and shareholder value for Kraft Heinz. 
I also established a new role, International Zone President for Kraft Heinz, combining our EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American zones, representing 20% of our global business. We did this to create a streamlined, more robust international structure to find commonalities, define their strategy and drive the business with greater speed. We will continue to share more of our approach to the strategic agenda over the coming quarters. We expect to complete our work by the year-end and anticipate sharing our conclusions with you early next year.
As we do with this plan, my experience has shown that to truly change the momentum of a business, we must understand the future, identifying where the consumer, their needs and the marketplace are headed, and then invest quickly and consistently to make sure our core brands will serve those needs better than the competition. Further, I believe we can and must find internal efficiencies, whether in our supply chain or fixed cost base that have both increased substantially in the last 2 years that can help to fund the strategy. 
Intense discipline is a virtue, but it's not an end in itself. I believe great companies are the ones that keep expenses under control so they can use the capital for new investments that grow both the top line and the bottom line. It's not one or the other. And as I look ahead, I'm very excited about the opportunities at Kraft Heinz. Similar to my attention to consumers, customers and colleagues, I also look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and quarters. 
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

It's a little hard to know from the outside, I guess, what rings true or not.

I really believe on the power of brands, and I think that we have an amazing portfolio of brands. Some are shiny, some are not. But I think that the heritage that we have in the brands, the household penetration that we have, the awareness that we have makes me feel very positive about the possibility of turning around some of the trends that we have in the brands that are not doing as well. I also think that we have a great scale, and that is a big competitive advantage in America. And I'm also very, very excited about the possibility of turning the business around. I've done it before in my life, and I think that it is possible. 
Now to take a business around, I think it's critical that we define comprehensive strategy, and this strategy has to be based on understanding the future, understanding the consumer. I believe that if we -- that the industry is in a huge transformation today, and transformation is also a moment of opportunity. And the ones that are going to take this opportunity are the ones that will understand the future better than the others, so then we'll lead. The ones that will not understand will follow, and the followers will not win. So we need, again, steps, a comprehensive simple strategy for the future and be very discipline on making and executing it. So I'm very excited. I'm much more excited today after 40 days than I was on day 1 about our future."

Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest more, especially in our people and our brands. I think that, as I said before, that our media investments are below where they should be. But before going after new investments, I would really look at the possibility of inefficiencies in the system so I can reorganize and redeploy these investments. I'm still -- of course, it's early to talk about it, but I'm seeing a lot of inefficiencies, and these for me are big opportunities. 
I'll give you just 2 examples so I'm not so theoretical. In marketing, Andrew, we increased investments in the last 2 years. But in media, we've been declining. We grew investments or we put money behind many other things, agency fees, production, research, product development. But the things that the consumer really sees, we declined to pay the other expense. These for me are inefficiencies that we can redeploy. 
I'll give you another example. Maybe because of all the complexity that we put in the system, our supply chain losses have been increasing, actually, double digits in the last years. That's not acceptable. We need to understand very well the root causes of these supply chain losses and that's to reduce them. These are losses that can be converted in investments. So just 2 examples of inefficiencies that I see very early here in my job, and this has to be my focus. Before talking about new investments and reducing the margin, I would -- I'm going after inefficiencies that I can put back in the system to feed the growth, and I'm seeing that."

So Chris, let me go back a little bit in time at Kraft Heinz. I think that when you put 2 companies together, the first cycle -- or first phase or the first cycle has to be really about bringing in new culture and extract inefficiencies. And I think that the company did a good job on that. We extracted a lot of efficiencies. We cut a lot of costs. But then after 2 years, it's hard to continue cutting costs. You need to change the strategy or you need to change the path. 
The first year, you have 2 CEOs. You cut 1 CEO, that's a cost cutting. But the following year, you don't have another CEO to cut. Cost cutting is a one-off activity and is necessary when you have the opportunity. But then you have to move and you have to think about how do you reduce costs but in a different way. And that way is, really, you have to change the way of operating the business. It's about efficiencies. It's about making better every day forever. You need to change the mindset. And if you continue cutting costs, you can get in trouble. 
I think that this second phase starts now with me. Yes, it could have started before. And I think the company would have benefit from that, but it didn't. And so it's time now with me, and I'm going to put a big emphasis on that. Not on cost cutting, but on efficiencies in the system, extracting efficiencies from the system, making better every day, making our factories much more efficient, making our execution in sales much better, making our market investments, as I mentioned before, much better as well, so we invest on things that the consumers see, not on the consumer doesn't see, et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question, Chris."

So like Miguel said, we're not providing point estimate guidance, but I can give some additional color on some of the items below the line. 
So we continue to expect up to $0.25 of unfavorability below our adjusted EBITDA line for the full year relative to 2018, and this negative impact will be greater in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half for a couple of different reasons. First off, the largest driver is tax. We had some discrete benefits in the first half, whereas we expect some discrete costs within the back half of the year. 
Second, we did see some FX favorability in the first half in other income that may flip in the second half. Third, related to incentive-based comp, we'll have a significant expense in the second half of the year, and this is due to the timing of the delayed filings of our 10-K and our 10-Qs, whereas we typically expect that to happen in the first half of the full year. And then finally, we may see some higher interest expense in the second half as well."

I want to go further a little bit and tell you why. I think that, first, because I believe that for Kraft Heinz, now we need -- what we don't need is to be focused on internal -- on product targets on the short term. We have a big agenda to build. We have a second half to deliver. But I think that working on structure and targets will not help. 
But second, since I've been here just for 40 days, I wouldn't feel comfortable about giving a guidance that I still do not have the necessary confidence about that number. I'm not sure if I'm going to overachieve by second half, if I'm going to underachieve or I will achieve. When -- in this situation, when managers look at the leaders always with empty pockets, right, like they don't know me yet. But what I know is that in the second half, some of the pressures that we had in the first half will fade, pressures like supply costs or even commercial costs. And that is positive. 
However, there's also risks, and risks such as further retailer inventory reductions, commodity inflation in categories where private label has had a lot of success like natural cheese, meat and coffee. But one observation that I can -- that I made early on is that from a seasonality standpoint, historically, Kraft Heinz usually earns 50% of the 50 -- at least 50% of the EBITDA in the first half of the year, but that's just an observation. So we'll see how we do."

But I can provide a little bit of color on our expectations for the full year without giving enough data point estimate for sales or EBITDA. 
So like I said before, we do expect to see better year-on-year performance on top and bottom line in the second half versus the first half. And some of the drivers are what's consistent with what we said in February, and there's some new potential risks to that as well. So what hasn't changed versus our expectations in February are continued retail takeaway that we've seen in the market with U.S. consumption up 1%, Canada consumption up 4% and that we expect to be -- continue to be supported by accelerated innovation in the back half. And we've also seen some promising growth globally in our Foodservice business as well. 
On top of that, we expect to see improved pricing trends in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half. And this will happen with some of the trade timing that we're lapping as well as the price increases in the U.S. that we implemented later in the first half that we'll fully lap in the second half as well. And then finally, on the positive side, as Miguel mentioned earlier, we do expect to see improving cost inflation as we start to lap some of the higher costs that we had in the second half of 2018. 
What has changed versus our expectations in February and as we progress through Q2, is we do see risks for further retail inventory reductions in the second half. Although we can't say what that may look like, we do see additional risk. And on top of that, we also see risk from accelerating key commodity inflation, particularly in the U.S. in meats and dairy. But we'll definitely try to manage via price but could be a risk to us in the second half. And then finally, we also have some potential adverse currency translation versus our expectations in February."

We need a strategy, first of all, for growth, which is critical. We need to find opportunities, find white spaces, what brands to invest, what channels today that we have lower share, what channels should I invest more and structure for growth, what countries where we should attack and grow and vest on. And this will all be part of our strategy for growth. 
So examples, I was talking here with my colleagues that a country that I know very well, China. In China, we have a very good business on soy sauce. We are leaders in 2 of the provinces, Guandong and Fujian. They're 2 of the most -- the richest provinces. But we are only there. It's a business or it's an industry -- starts off as an industry of $12 billion, it grows 8% per year and we have great equity there. But we are just in 2 provinces. Big opportunities to grow outside of this provinces. There's a big opportunity to have other sauces, not only soy sauce. Why haven't we done it? I don't know exactly. But I see this as a big opportunity, it's a white space that we have to organize ourselves for growth. 
It's also mentality, it's mindset, that we have to do it. And to fund -- and we have to work on the other side to fund these growth initiatives. We have to be very efficient. We have to be more efficient than everybody else. And to tell you the truth, when I came and when arrived here, I was absolutely sure that I would find these opportunities for growth, I was not sure if we had the opportunities for efficiencies because I didn't know the business. And I -- today, I know that we have. 
But there are many other white spaces like in the West, talking about ethnicity. 20% of the population in America are Hispanics and represents 40% of the growth of the population. We don't have absolutely anything in our portfolio today to attend this population. We don't even communicate to the Hispanic community. That is an opportunity. 
So I'm looking at these opportunities everywhere from a brand standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from an ethnicity standpoint, from a country standpoint. And this will be only inputs that we will put in our strat plan that we'll present to our Board at the end of the year and to you at the beginning of next year. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question."

But as far as the return on that investment and return on any investment you're making in marketing your brands, in the categories that you're in, do you feel like there are enough microcosms or individual success stories that you can build upon here?

Consumption is up. We haven't seen consumption up for a long time. Shares are flat.

We haven't seen consumption up for a long time. Shares are flat. And I would say the same -- here in front of me I have here reports from Nielsen with 21 categories, 13 of them had positive shares in the first half of the year. So I could argue with you that some of -- there are a lot of investments that are working. I would mention Heinz Ketchup, with the innovation that we had and the communication, is a very good example. Innovation to premiumize the brand, launching organic version, no added sugar, that we can charge more, that have higher margins. And that helps us well the image of the brand. And that is a very good example of what to do. We put more money behind the brand and we achieve all-time share, achieving 70% share. That's a good example. 
So -- but on the other hand, again, as I said, I think we can do a much better job on focus on investments on core brands, not dilute at among a lot of brands and small brands. Do more innovation on big brands instead of launching too many new brands. Have the innovation that is more incremental and not dilutive. I think we did a lot of brand extensions but not enough of a creative innovation. So there's the big homework to be done in marketing. I don't think everything is wrong at all. I think there are a lot of good examples. But we could -- we can do better and consistently invest in our brands."

Two questions from me as well, and you probably just kind of touched on it by referencing the consumption and market share trends. But I appreciate the commentary on the reinvestment into people, in media and maybe into some white space opportunities. A lot of investors we speak with have also questioned whether or not investment may be necessary in price, whether it be to narrow price gaps with private label or change the economics of retailers to incent them to focus more on your brands. I would love it if you could just maybe comment on that, on where you see these price gaps and the retail economics today, and whether or not you think they're properly aligned."

Specifically on pricing, I think that on categories that we lead, we need to meet the pricing. And maybe in the past, it took us too much time to pass inflation and we suffered with that. I also think that pricing -- averages on pricing are dangerous because we have brands like Heinz Ketchup or like Philadelphia that industrial innovation -- or not innovation, we have been able to pass price. And we continue growing and we're achieving all-time highs market share. But of course, we have more pressure on categories where we have more competition from private label and where -- are more driven by commodities like cheese. 
So David mentioned before that, yes, one of the risks we have in the second half is because cheese -- the commodity of cheese is increasing dramatically, the price of cheese. And we have asking prices. And they are expecting private label to follow, but we don't know. We don't know if -- so that's a risk. So that would be my comments on pricing. 
But I would like to go beyond. I think opportunities in revenue management exists as well. I think we can do a better job of -- to maximize the discounts. Discount is a big investment. And I think we can be much better on allocating discounts by accounts, by product, throughout the year. Understand better what works and in what way and when and how. And I also think that innovation can play a big role on revenue management and, as a consequence, on pricing. So I think there are good opportunities in this area that I want to explore moving forward."

So on the impairment side, first off, our impairment testing, as you know, occurs in Q2 every year. And so we performed our testing procedures this year after we filed the 10-K concurrent with preparing our Q1 and Q2 financial statements. And to reiterate, these are preliminary numbers that we disclosed in the 8-K. 
So the preliminary impairment charges in the first half were driven by 2 main factors. So first off, as you said, we did have revised expectations in response to current market factors in some of our international businesses that were evaluated during the first quarter of 2019 as we developed these 5-year plans. And as a reminder, these are the EMEA East reporting unit, LTA Exports reporting unit and Brazil where we had an impairment.
Secondly, we also had the application of a higher discount rate to reflect the sustained decline in our stock price since the start of the year. And so also, we should keep in mind that we did start the year with nearly $60 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles with less than 20% cushion relative to their carrying value. So what that means is there's going to be continued risk of future impairments, given any change in forecast or modeling assumption can particularly trigger that. 
And to answer your question specifically. As we kind of updated and developed these operating forecasts, we did have lower revenue and margin expectations, specifically for the 3 reporting units that I mentioned, EMEA East, Brazil and LTA Exports. The 6 brands that were impaired within Q2 were driven by the increased discount rate, which again was reflecting the sustained reduction in our stock price since the start of the year."

Steve, look, we'll update you throughout -- or through the rest of the year on how strategic work is going, but it's our intention to share with our Board at the end of the year and then sharing with you at the beginning of next year. 
Now talking a little bit about my experience with food or with beer and how this has -- can be adapted to food. I think there are a lot of similarities, but there are a lot of differences as well. And I think this has been actually pretty good, arriving here with fresh eyes and asking questions that some were obvious but people were not asking themselves for a long time. Some were not obvious and they had not been asked about it before. And so this has been positive. 
I think that my experience in the past, both from leading global brands at ABI and using premiumization as a way to grow top line, were very interesting. When I was Head of Marketing, ABI has been growing substantially because of mix, because of premium brands, and I think, actually, this is an opportunity in the food industry. There is a big premiumization going on, but the premiumization actually is coming much more from the small players not from the big food players. But let me share with you another experience from my past that, I think, we can adapt here in -- at Kraft Heinz. 
I ran our business in Asia, and China has been the best story of organic growth for ABI. And the reason why we succeeded was because we understood the future of business in China better than anybody else. And we understood that the economic growth would bring huge premiumization, wealth, the channels would change -- night-life channel would grow immensely. And so we'd make all the best in the future. We'd make all the best in what would grow not what was big necessarily. And that happened. 
And making that parallel with Kraft Heinz, I think this is critical for us. Yes, we need to navigate through the present, but we need to give a strategy for the future. We need to define where this business is going to grow, where food is going to grow and be ahead of everybody else. In the case of China, we understood that much better even than the local brewers. We understood China better than them. And I think that, again, this what I was talking about the future before. If we understand the future and we lead the future, we're going to win. And the ones that will not understand will just follow. And I really want to be in the first group not in the second group.
So -- and as I said before, there's big transformation in food. Negative people would be afraid of that. I'm an optimistic by nature, and I believe that this transformation is an area of big opportunity. And the ones that will understand the future are the ones that are going to win, and we'll be those. 
Well, this was the last question. I just would like to finish just by saying a couple of words maybe summarizing a little bit of what we talked during this call. 
I wanted to tell you, to reinforce, how excited and how delighted I am with the opportunity to take Kraft Heinz to the next level. I am, the way that you are, disappointed with the first half results, but I'm determined to rebuild our business momentum. I have our Board's support, and not only support, and expectation to set a new direction, a new forward. And for me, there are no sacred cows, no preconceived ideas, just fresh eyes and just thinking about what is best for our great company. 
I know there's a lot of headwinds, but I see also encouraging solid consumption trends that are very positive. But we must continue to work our portfolio, our strategy and invest strategically to put ourselves in a position for top line and bottom line growth. We need to improve our speed. We need to become absolutely obsessed with the consumer and understanding the future better than anybody else. We need to pivot from a cost-cutting mentality to a continuous improvement, efficiency-focused. And we need to strengthen the balance sheet. That remains a priority.
So thank you very much for your time. I'm delighted to be here with you today and really looking forward to knowing you personally and to be sharing our -- my views and to be learning from you as well. Thank you very much."

I also highlighted some potential risks to the second half performance. Three months on, and we are getting to deeply understand our business. That business is on a better footing because we are increasing visibility and control of our costs. The team is making excellent progress and we are gaining confidence in our path forward. We are not where we believe we can be, but we are excited with the evolution we had in the third quarter and what we have ahead of us. This comes from directing our efforts to 3 work streams: stabilizing the business as we execute to the 2019 plan; setting our near-term transformation in motion; and establishing a true north through our enterprise strategy work. As we committed to you earlier, we will give you a detailed plan coming out of the enterprise strategy work early next year. But we do want to share the progress we have made and set early high-level observations with you today. 
In terms of delivering our 2019 plan and how we are running the business day-to-day our performance improved from the first half of the year, and we are seeing signs of continuous improvement taking hold. As I said on our last call, my #1 focus is our people and developing the team because it's our people that will deliver continuous improvement and the turnaround of Kraft Heinz. Since our last call, we have made a number of moves to enhance our leadership team, both at the global level and within business units. For instance, I named Nina Barton to a new role, Chief Growth Officer, where in addition to leading the development of our enterprise strategy, Nina has responsibility for overall channel growth, global e-commerce and digital, innovation, marketing services and R&D. In Finance, our need is to move with speed and have in place proven well-respected leaders that know the business from the start. With that, I'm delighted to have Paulo Basilio back to the position of Global CFO and also Andre Maciel to be our head of the U.S. Finance, a job he held for the first few years following the merger. To build morale and ensure a high level of engagement, I have held 9 townhalls and put out roughly 20 internal videos to shine a spot line of activities that employees across the world, across Heinz, are doing to address the company. In this past month, we held a global Kraft Heinz Meal pack where employees from 15 locations across 9 countries got together with rise against hunger to pack 1 million meals for children in need. Not only we reached the target, but we over-delivered by packing more than 1.2 million meals. And although we have still a lot to do to build our bench strength, in terms of recruiting, I'm very encouraged by the number of people we've seen that want to be part of our turnaround. Results-wise, organic net sales growth was up slightly on a sequential basis. And year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA was down roughly 4.5% in Q3 on a constant currency basis versus 16% in the first half. Pricing is coming through and inflecting from negative deposit in both United States and EMEA, with overall elasticity in line with our expectations. Net inflation in our supply chain costs falling from 3.3% in the first half of the year to below 1% in the third quarter, marking the first quarter since 2017, that we have been seeing stability on the cost side. And we began to lap stepped-up marketing and e-commerce spending and investments in sales and customer service from the previous year. In addition, we are seeing significant positive momentum where we have something to say, and this includes with single-digit retail takeaway in our U.S. condiments and sauces, cream cheese, snacks, desserts and seasonal franchise. In ketchup, specifically, we are getting great traction around the world behind our Heinz 150th anniversary, including our first ever global Heinz campaign featuring of music star, Ed Sheeran. And our total U.S. sauces business, which includes ketchup, mustard, mayo, Miracle Whip, salad dressings and pasta sauce has continued to build momentum since 2017. Brazil is growing double digits in both retail and foodservice channels, and we are seeing solid growth of 14% in our China soy sauce business. 
At the same time, we are still far from where we should be. While overall performance is improving, our numbers are still negative versus the prior year, and our performance remains uneven across categories and across geographies. This includes ongoing share and distribution losses within our natural cheese, cold cuts and coffee business in the United States, lower-than-anticipated promotional lifts in Canada, ongoing infant nutrition declines in both EMEA and China as well as increasing supply chain costs in our Rest of the world segment. To change our transitory, we must improve our execution around the category, brand and sales initiatives by making critical fixes and closing any capability gaps; and drive greater efficiency in our supply chain across procurement, manufacturing and distribution. So while we have been working hard to finish the year in a much better place than we started, we have also been investing a lot of energy in our future. We are developing 9 transformational projects that touch the core areas of our company to improve our capabilities and make us a more efficient company. Our teams are making rapid progress understanding root causes, defining what needs to be done and already taking some actions that will benefit 2020. 
The 9 projects currently underway, includes 5 projects focused on top line, 2 projects focused on operational efficiencies and 2 projects focused on organizational effectiveness. Slide 10 shows our list of projects and the scope of each, but let me provide some examples to illustrate. In marketing, we are defining the framework and optimal marketing spend, both by brand and by working/nonworking allocations. And so far, we identified the opportunity to relocate a substantial amount of dollars to work immediately in 2020 as well as redirect dollars disproportionately towards support of our flagship brands. Based on this alone, we will see a significant percentage increase in media spend and an even greater increase for the brands that are the biggest drivers of our profitability. Around our innovation efforts, we are revamping our product development process so we can be faster and more consumer-centric with our new products, and we are evaluating shifting innovation support to fewer, bigger, better initiatives, launches that promise to be more incremental to our base. As a result, in 2020, we will reduce the number of projects being launched by half and better align our post-2020 pipeline with our enterprise strategy. 
In sales, the work is concentrated in 3 areas. First, strengthening day-to-day execution through ways of working and timing of our planning process to tighten the connectivity between sales, our category teams and more importantly, with our retail partners. Second, is developing a road map for price, mix, promotion and trade improvements. And third is developing a channel strategy, better defined roles and priorities for each part of the portfolio, by channel and by customer. In supply chain, we have several projects underway that collectively can deliver significant efficiencies to help offset inflation with the goal of funding our long-term strategy. A key driver of this will be examining every SKU, cutting anything with a negative margin, and in the process, removing complexity from the system to boost productivity and improved mix. Based on our work to date, we see scope to rationalize a significant portion of the SKUs in our U.S. business and with minimal impact on profits. There is also more work being done elsewhere, including the transformation of our financial planning and forecasting that Paulo is heading up. 
Taking a step back, I think it's important to recognize here that even though we are putting things in motion now, the purpose of all these projects is to lay a foundation that will support us for the long run. 
Finally, regarding the long term, in the third quarter, we initiated and we are on track with the development of our enterprise strategy. We are developing a much better understanding of the consumer with a view to the future. We are setting our strategic direction, where we believe we can drive the greatest growth and returns by brand, by category, by geography and by channel with the full support and participation of our board. And we are assessing how best to organize ourselves against our biggest opportunities. There is still much work ahead of us. But we remain confident in our ability to launch our enterprise strategy and share it in detail with you early next year. Personally, I'm encouraged and excited at how our people are embracing change, their desire to get better through new ways of doing things and to move with speed. After all, these are the key ingredients to building a continuous improvement mindset. And as I said on the last call, one of our key principles and goals for the company going forward is not only to identify the new investments needed to grow both the top line and the bottom line, but keeping expenses under control and using that capital to support those investments. With that, I will turn over to Paulo to discuss where we are and where we expect to go from here on the financial front."

I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved ve",1118,"Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved versus the first half, with organic net sales down 1.1%. Pricing turned from negative in the first half to positive in the quarter. This was driven by realization of the pricing actions we announced in the first part of the year in the United States and EMEA as well as ongoing pricing to offset inflation in Latin America. All mix was lower versus the prior year as we are lapping the strong gains in the prior year and continue to see unfavorable changes in retail inventory levels versus the prior year. In Q3, retail inventory change resulted in a negative 110 basis point impact to U.S. Walmex. That translated into a roughly 80 basis point decline versus the prior year for total Kraft Heinz results. And for the fourth quarter, I will note here that we currently expect a roughly 50 basis point headwind from lower retail inventory levels for our U.S. business. 
With respect to profitability, EBITDA is beginning to stabilize. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was down 4.6% versus the prior year. And this includes a roughly 1.5 percentage point negative impact from divestitures. Excluding these factors, the reduction EBITDA was driven by a mix of negatives and positives. On the positive side, we are getting supply chain costs under control in the U.S. EMEA returned to EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis. And we had favorable timing of marketing and selling expenses in the U.S. versus the prior year. At the same time, supply chain costs were still negative year-on-year on a global basis in Q3, driven by higher supply chain losses in the rest of the world markets. A combination of lower pricing and higher input costs led to another weak performance versus the prior year in Canada, and both of these need to be fixed going forward. 
Finally, at adjusted EPS, Q3 results were better than we anticipated 3 months ago. This is mainly due to a combination of a better-than-expected outcome in other income and expenses due to favorable FX gains, favorable order income that we do not expect to repeat, lower-than-expected interest expense as a result of successful refinancing as well as more favorable discrete items in the tax line. With respect to our effective tax rate, we are now expecting a rate in between 19% and 20% for the full year versus the 21% expected previously, which brings me to our financial outlook and near-term expectations. 
On a personal note, it was an honor when Miguel and the board asked me to step back into the CFO role here at Kraft Heinz. Much has changed since I last held it. As Miguel has been saying, this period calls for new thinking and new ways of doing business. One area that I believe must be of greater focus is the company trajectory in gross profit. As mentioned, we are revisiting the efficiency in many areas of our supply chain, the effectiveness of our programming, our profitability at an SKU level, as well as product mix to create a better sales. In the process, the elimination of ink to volume made paper organic net sales in the near term. In addition, key commodity inflation and price volatility in both cheese and meats is likely to remain a challenge in both Q4 and into next year. While we are implementing pricing in both these areas, reaction in the market remains unclear at this point. So as always, we will need to balance market share, distribution and profitability. 
And finally, please note that the divestitures we closed earlier this year will and unfavorable currency may continue to temper our reported results in the near term. At EBITDA, we are focused on continuous improvement with the goal of stabilizing constant currency adjusted EBITDA, excluding divestitures on a year-on-year basis. As mentioned, our visibility on net inflation within our supply chain is improving. We also have significant scope to drive the business forward through greater investments in media that we are determined to make happen. So far, we have been encouraged by our ability to find and fund efficiencies to help offset inflation and to help fund those investments in [indiscernible]. That said, we are still defining our interest price strategy and finalizing our broader ambition to see if more will be needed. 
So far as guidance goes, we continue to think it would not be productive for the organization to provide specific point estimate financial guidance. I will tell you, however, in recognizing that we are still at early stages, it would be prudent to expect year-on-year top and bottom line performance in Q4 to be generally similar to what we saw in Q3. And from an earnings per share perspective, while we have delivered better-than-expected income and expenses below adjusted EBITDA, we still expect these items to be unfavorable on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. Collectively, we expect this below the line items to negatively impact EPS by up to $0.10 versus the prior year in Q4. 
Now before we move to Q&A, there is another area I think is important to address in terms of progress to date, where we currently stand and where we go from here, and that is our capital structure. Here, we have been making significant progress against our balance sheet priorities, and we believe they have strong credit momentum to build on. From the merger to the end of 2018, we diligently reduced gross debt by $2.4 billion. In Q3, we announced an additional $2.3 billion of cash-funded debt take-out that was enabled by a combination of divestiture proceeds and solid cash generation. And all the way, we have taken a number of actions to put our in an overfunded stocks and have prefunded most of our post-retirement benefit obligations. As a result, we have minimum future contribution requirements going forward. Also in Q3, we undertook a successful leverage near to $3 billion refinance that further strengths our liquidity. We have a strong investor participation in our offering That we think reinforced investor confidence. And this refinance gives us significant flexibility through 2025, especially given the fact that we currently have no commercial paper outstanding and a $4 billion revolving credit facility that has never been drawn. Refinancing our debt as well as establishing our long-term strategy are critical steps to defining how we will continue to deleverage our company and maintain our investment-grade status. Now we would be happy to take your questions."

And the best -- better visibility and cost and net inflation. So we are expecting pretty much in sales and EBITDA similar year-over-year performance as we saw in Q3.

And the reason I ask is because I presume this is where it can be quite helpful in terms of funding the media spend investment that you mentioned today on the call, other things, inflation and such that come up all in the context of managing EBITDA to be more stable within the confines, I guess, of a constrained balance sheet. So perhaps, any color on that you can provide would be helpful."

From day 1, when I looked at the past, and I saw that there was a a pretty big deterioration of gross profit because of the decrease of costs, we made -- we defined supply as a big area for improvement for 2 reasons. First, because we had pretty big disruptions in the past with our customers for -- because of low service levels. But second, because COGS has been increasing in our company. And I do not see a reason for that. I think that if we change the mentality to the company for a mentality of continuous improvement, if we invest on that, people in our factories, in our way of thinking on believing if we change the mentality from basically cost-cutting into continuous improvement, I think we can do it and we should do it. And as you said, I see it as a great source of -- for investment in the business. I was very glad to see that in this quarter, we could stabilize cost of goods sold. And this is big for us. We are all relieved with that. It's just the first step. Everything will be proved, but the first step was good and gives us a lot of face, a lot of hope that we are in the right direction."

And maybe related to that, the SKU reduction, is there anything related to like new insights, new capabilities that, that would now would be the time to look at reducing SKUs in North America?

Specifically, let me start specifically with the SKUs that you are mentioning, and then I go -- I tell you, overall, my point of view about that. I think we -- the company has been on a frenzy of innovation in the last 2 to 3 years and trying through launching new products to compensate the decline in net sales. We have not been successful on that. We really have not been successful on that. Yes, we brought a lot of complexity to the system but this innovation was not translated into additional sales. It was very cannibalistic and brought much more complexity and as a consequence, a lot of supply chain losses and lower margins. Many of these innovation was done through third-party manufacturers. So first, that's -- for me, when I arrived and with fresh eyes. I have the obvious questions and and one of them is, let me understand profitability by SKU, let me understand volume by SKU, and there's a detail of SKUs that yes, actually, with a negative margin or are not important at all, are very, very small or both. And that can just generate a lot of complexity in the system. And so yes, we are going to reduce this, we are going to reduce. We have to have the discipline that, at the same time that we innovate and we put new products in the market. We have to have the discipline to clean the tail of low margin, negative margin or a low volume, very low volume, that are really not just creating more complexity in the system. And this is a capability. So going back to your point about capabilities. I think that innovation is an area that we have to increase, we'll have to improve dramatically. There are other areas that I think that we have to improve our capabilities. And -- but I think that innovation is one that I'm very focused on. It is a big driver for growth for the future, has to be especially in the food industry, but we have to do bigger innovation. We have to do fewer innovation. We have to do bolder innovation. We have to do profitable innovation and has to be incremental. Instead of doing everything and all products innovating and vouching and throwing new products in the market that will not really generate extra profitability to our company."

Are you going to give us kind of a ramp of what those next 3 years might look like when you give us the review? And then secondly, a more detailed question. In your conversations with customers, have you found that customers are giving you any kind of insight on their perception of Kraft versus your peers? My perception is that Kraft has had some pretty rigid structures in terms of pay-for-performance with customers, and maybe that led to some of the disputes that you've had in the past. Is there any insight you can give us in that regard?"

Let me answer first the first one, Robert. I'm working at the same time, in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019 on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right?

I'm working at the same time, in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019 on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right? For 2020, I need the strategy, but this -- 2020 is going to be more about continued stabilization. And this is what I aim, is that 2020 is a year that we stabilize the business, that we build the foundation for growth in 2021. So the answer to you is yes, when we present the strategy that we are working on, that is going to be a long term with a long-term view. So we -- our 3-year plan will be addressed. Regarding customers, yes, I've been talking to customers and learning a lot from them. And I can tell you that their biggest concern is what you call the disputes and did that translate into service levels. So we had problems in the past, several problems in different types of products with our service level, and that, although we haven't had any big problem this year, so we are in a much better year in terms of service level, there are still scars from the past. And then when they remind us of all the problems that we had in the previous years in terms of service level, their questions are, if this is sustainable or not. They also -- so this, I would say, that is their #1 concern, really, service level. But they're also concerned about planning and strategy. So we need to be better on our planning with them and adapt our planning cycle to their planning cycle. I think there's a big opportunity to do that, and we are going to address that. At this moment, because of the way we are planned -- that we plan on our budget cycle doesn't tie with their budget cycle. The feeling I have is that we are always late and the feeling that they have is the same. The other part is related to strategy that they want to see us communicating to them and teaching them and is training them in a more strategic way on a long term. And then I would put the fourth point that, that is about execution, that we can have better execution in their stores. So I would say that these are the 4 items that we -- when I think about customers that I'm focused on, really, service level, planning, strategy and execution."

If we go back to EBITDA for fiscal '17 and then compare it to where we are the last 12 months, there's an EBITDA decline of about $1.6 billion or so. And can you give us a little of a bridge of kind of what the drivers were that got us from there to here?

And again, when you reach these 2, let's say, our last 12, as I said. Pretty much, we have 2 big drivers, 2 big areas of decline, right? 60% of the decline roughly is coming from gross margin. And this -- you could split this in mainly the inflation we have in our supply chain with not enough initiatives to offset that; investments that we had in service level for the customers; an unfavorable product mix that we saw in the launch of the business, and this is part of the type of incrementality, the innovation that we had that Miguel was talking about; and also the fact that with all of this inflation and not enough savings or efficiency initiatives to offset that, we were slow in moving our prices. So I think this is pretty much 60% of the gap. The other 30% of the gap is driven by SG&A. So 60-plus around gross margin, 25% to 30% around SG&A. 70% of that was pretty much commercial investments we made. We had an international go-to-market initiatives, new areas inside the company like digital and also additional market investments that we put, that is because of our fragmentation of innovation, ended up going too much to nonworking piece to support the innovation pipeline. So and the remaining, also we have like of 30% of the 25% from the SG&A is pretty much lapping bonds accrual that we didn't have in 2017. So a 6% gross margin 30% SG&A, with 70% of this 30% coming from these commercial investments that we made that we are assessing now. The other 30% of the 25% decline, driven by bonds that we didn't have in '17. I think it's -- on that, I think it's -- and we, internally here, and myself specifically, we reflect a lot about about this, the performance and the root cause of this performance. And we had a big leaks of key learnings here and things that we're going to go after and things that came from the outside. That's pretty much at the base of all this initiative near-term projects that we have. But at the end of the day, pretty much, we were not kind of fast enough to move from that first initial integration stage to build this organic growth plan for the company. In a moment that the industry had a lot of big transformations, right, both from the customer land, from the retailers land. So I think that was the name -- the combination of the things that I think drove our past 3 years' performance down. But now I think the constant is that we built this work streams with Miguel to address those things. To -- again, we had a lot of cost inside the business. And now we are reassessing each of them the ability for us to get back them to be able to help to fund all the investments that we are identifying as opportunities in the business. And what we can share also here is that so far, we found a lot of opportunities to invest. And I was saying behind media, behind higher support from a more concentrated set of innovation. And so far, we were able to find the sources inside the company to fund those investments. Again, of course, we are still working on the strategy and make the price that we expect to find more areas of opportunity and also more areas of savings to support potentially those investments."

So a very good question. And I'll tell you, I think that there's a fundamental change that -- or we need to do a fundamental change in the company, from a company that was much more focused on today and probably pursuing a strategy that was more focused on inorganic growth to a company that needs to pursue organic growth and needs to understand the future better than anybody else. That's a big change. You need to change, you need to put first the mindset in a direction. Second, really a strategy, where do we think that the growth is going or going to happen. So we need to transform this company into a much more consumer-driven company in a much more looking-forward type of company. Rather than just operating the present, it's not either one or the other. We need to do both. And I think that we can and we should do both. So as a consequence, I think that the innovation was we did a lot of plan extensions. We were aligned too much on things that were not really incremental and we need to do more things in areas that we believe are going to grow. The last call, I gave the example of Boca, and I think is a good example. We were the first company introducing veggie burgers 15 years ago. But because we didn't have a good vision about how the world would progress, Boca has not been a focused brand. And as a consequence, we never really took advantage of  everything that is happening in this area. So understanding the future, understanding the consumer, I think is the way to go. Of course that for that, we will need much more better insights, much better creativity. We'll need a more United R&D. So we didn't have a Head of R&D. R&D was in all departments of the company. We are now unifying R&D in the company, having one head of R&D. We are defining our strategy. We also appointed a Chief Growth Officer. All things into this direction, right. Hopefully, I was -- I gave you the answer you were expecting, John. I don't know if you want to ask anything else related to that."

In my previous company, I worked for 22 years and I learned to love CBB. But for one reason, because CBB was a big lever or made it possible to grow the business throughout the year. So when I look at CBB, I look at a discipline to make things every day better, so we can free up resources to invest in other products. I don't look at CBB as a way to basically cut costs and cut costs. I see it as a way to do things better every day and have the consequence of that is to be more efficient and to free up resources to invest in the business. But addressing your second point about how are you going to invest in things that today are small, and tomorrow can be big, are you going to have that discipline. I think that question is very, very important. Having companies tend to invest on what's big and not what it will grow. And I think we need to do both. And we really need to understand what will grow and that on it. It may be smaller today, but you need to have the patience to nurture these categories, these products, these brands to be big one day. I'm looking at this right now, not only brands but also channels that today may not be so representative, but have a great potential for the future. So I tend to agree with you, and I don't think that, that has to do with ZBB. It's just the opposite. I think that ZBB will free up resources to invest in these categories."

On our previous call, I promised to be candid with you from the start and to update you on our progress along the way. I also highlighted some potential risks to the second half performance. 3 months on, and we are getting to deeply understand our business. That business is on a better footing because we are increasing visibility and control of our costs. The team is making excellent progress and we are gaining confidence in our path forward. We are not where we believe we can be, but we are excited with the evolution we had in the third quarter and what we have ahead of us. This comes from directing our efforts to 3 work streams: stabilizing the business as we execute to the 2019 plan; setting our near-term transformation in motion; and establishing a true north through our enterprise strategy work. As we committed to you earlier, we will give you a detailed plan coming out of the enterprise strategy work early next year. But we do want to share the progress we have made and set early high-level observations with you today. 
In terms of delivering our 2019 plan and how we are running the business day-to-day our performance improved from the first half of the year, and we are seeing signs of continuous improvement taking hold. As I said on our last call, my #1 focus is our people and developing the team because it's our people that will deliver continuous improvement and the turnaround of Kraft Heinz. Since our last call, we have made a number of moves to enhance our leadership team, both at the global level and within business units. For instance, I named Nina Barton to a new role, Chief Growth Officer, where in addition to leading the development of our enterprise strategy, Nina has responsibility for overall channel growth, global e-commerce and digital, innovation, marketing services and R&D.
In Finance, our need is to move with speed and have in place proven well-respected leaders that know the business from the start. With that, I'm delighted to have Paulo Basilio back to the position of Global CFO and also Andre Maciel to be our Head of the U.S. Finance, a job he held for the first few years following the merger. To build morale and ensure a high level of engagement, I have held 9 town halls and put out roughly 20 internal videos to shine a spotlight of activities that employees across the world, across Heinz, are doing to address the company. In this past month, we held a global Kraft Heinz Meal Packathon where employees from 15 locations across 9 countries got together with Rise Against Hunger to pack 1 million meals for children in need. Not only we reached the target, but we overdelivered by packing more than 1.2 million meals. And although we have still a lot to do to build our bench strength, in terms of recruiting, I'm very encouraged by the number of people we've seen that want to be part of our turnaround. Results-wise, organic net sales growth was up slightly on a sequential basis. And year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA was down roughly 4.5% in Q3 on a constant currency basis versus 16% in the first half.
Pricing is coming through and inflecting from negative deposit in both United States and EMEA, with overall elasticity in line with our expectations. Net inflation in our supply chain costs falling from 3.3% in the first half of the year to below 1% in the third quarter, marking the first quarter since 2017 that we have been seeing stability on the cost side. And we began to lap stepped-up marketing and e-commerce spending and investments in sales and customer service from the previous year. In addition, we are seeing significant positive momentum where we have something to say, and this includes mid-single-digit retail takeaway in our U.S. condiments and sauces, cream cheese, snacks, desserts and seasonal franchise. In ketchup, specifically, we are getting great traction around the world behind our Heinz 150th anniversary, including our first-ever global Heinz campaign featuring pop music star, Ed Sheeran. And our total U.S. sauces business, which includes ketchup, mustard, mayo, Miracle Whip, salad dressings and pasta sauce, has continued to build momentum since 2017.
Brazil is growing double digits in both retail and foodservice channels, and we are seeing solid growth of 14% in our China soy sauce business. 
At the same time, we are still far from where we should be. While overall performance is improving, our numbers are still negative versus the prior year, and our performance remains uneven across categories and across geographies. This includes ongoing share and distribution losses within our natural cheese, cold cuts and coffee business in the United States, lower-than-anticipated promotional lifts in Canada, ongoing infant nutrition declines in both EMEA and China as well as increasing supply chain costs in our Rest of the World segment. To change our trajectory, we must improve our execution around the category, brand and sales initiatives by making critical fixes and closing any capability gaps; and drive greater efficiency in our supply chain across procurement, manufacturing and distribution. So while we have been working hard to finish the year in a much better place than we started, we have also been investing a lot of energy in our future. We are developing 9 transformational projects that touch the core areas of our company to improve our capabilities and make us a more efficient company. Our teams are making rapid progress understanding root causes, defining what needs to be done and already taking some actions that will benefit 2020. 
The 9 projects currently underway includes 5 projects focused on top line, 2 projects focused on operational efficiencies and 2 projects focused on organizational effectiveness.
Slide 10 shows our list of projects and the scope of each, but let me provide some examples to illustrate. In marketing, we are defining the framework and optimal marketing spend, both by brand and by working/nonworking allocations. And so far, we identified the opportunity to reallocate a substantial amount of dollars to work in within 2020 as well as redirect dollars disproportionately towards support of our flagship brands. Based on this alone, we will see a significant percentage increase in media spend and an even greater increase for the brands that are the biggest drivers of our profitability. Around our innovation efforts, we are revamping our product development process so we can be faster and more consumer-centric with our new products. And we are evaluating shifting innovation support to fewer, bigger, better initiatives, launches that promise to be more incremental to our base. As a result, in 2020, we will reduce the number of projects being launched by half and better align our post-2020 pipeline with our enterprise strategy. 
In sales, the work is concentrated in 3 areas. First, strengthening day-to-day execution through ways of working and timing of our planning process to tighten the connectivity between sales, our category teams, and more importantly, with our retail partners.  Second is developing a road map for price, mix, promotion and trade improvements. And third is developing a channel strategy, better defined roles and priorities for each part of the portfolio, by channel and by customer. In supply chain, we have several projects underway that collectively can deliver significant efficiencies to help offset inflation with the goal of funding our long-term strategy. A key driver of this will be examining every SKU, cutting anything with a negative margin, and in the process, removing complexity from the system to boost productivity and improve mix. Based on our work to date, we see scope to rationalize a significant portion of the SKUs in our U.S. business and with minimal impact on profits. There is also more work being done elsewhere, including the transformation of our financial planning and forecasting that Paulo is heading up. 
Taking a step back, I think it's important to recognize here that even though we are putting things in motion now, the purpose of all these projects is to lay a foundation that will support us for the long run. 
Finally, regarding the long term, in the third quarter, we initiated and we are on track with the development of our enterprise strategy. We are developing a much better understanding of the consumer with a view to the future. We are setting our strategic direction, where we believe we can drive the greatest growth and returns by brand, by category, by geography and by channel with the full support and participation of our Board. And we are assessing how best to organize ourselves against our biggest opportunities. There is still much work ahead of us, but we remain confident in our ability to launch our enterprise strategy and share it in detail with you early next year. Personally, I'm encouraged and excited at how our people are embracing change, their desire to get better through new ways of doing things and to move with speed. After all, these are the key ingredients to building a continuous improvement mindset. And as I said on the last call, one of our key principles and goals for the company going forward is not only to identify the new investments needed to grow both the top line and the bottom line, but keeping expenses under control and using that capital to support those investments.
With that, I will turn over to Paulo to discuss where we are and where we expect to go from here on the financial front."
278212,640112009,1847246,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2019",2019-10-31,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved ve",1121,"Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved versus the first half, with organic net sales down 1.1%. Pricing turned from negative in the first half to positive in the quarter. This was driven by realization of the pricing actions we announced in the first part of the year in the United States and EMEA as well as ongoing pricing to offset inflation in Latin America. Vol/mix was lower versus the prior year as we are lapping the strong gains in the prior year and continue to see unfavorable changes in retail inventory levels versus the prior year. In Q3, retail inventory change resulted in a negative 110 basis point impact to U.S. vol/mix. That translated into a roughly 80 basis point decline versus the prior year for total Kraft Heinz results. And for the fourth quarter, I will note here that we currently expect a roughly 50 basis point headwind from lower retail inventory levels for our U.S. business. 
With respect to profitability, EBITDA is beginning to stabilize. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was down 4.6% versus the prior year. And this includes a roughly 1.5 percentage point negative impact from divestitures. Excluding these factors, the reduction in EBITDA was driven by a mix of negatives and positives. On the positive side, we are getting supply chain costs under control in the U.S. EMEA returned to EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis. And we had favorable timing of marketing and selling expenses in the U.S. versus the prior year. At the same time, supply chain costs were still negative year-on-year on a global basis in Q3, driven by higher supply chain losses in the Rest of the World markets. A combination of lower pricing and higher input costs led to another weak performance versus the prior year in Canada, and both of these need to be fixed going forward. 
Finally, at adjusted EPS, Q3 results were better than we anticipated 3 months ago. This is mainly due to a combination of a better-than-expected outcome in other income and expenses due to favorable FX gains, favorable order income that we do not expect to repeat, lower-than-expected interest expense as a result of successful refinancing as well as more favorable discrete items in the tax line. With respect to our effective tax rate, we are now expecting a rate in between 19% and 20% for the full year versus the 21% expected previously, which brings me to our financial outlook and near-term expectations. 
On a personal note, it was an honor when Miguel and the Board asked me to step back into the CFO role here at Kraft Heinz. Much has changed since I last held it. As Miguel has been saying, this period calls for new thinking and new ways of doing business. One area that I believe must be of greater focus is the company trajectory in gross profit. As mentioned, we are revisiting the efficiency in many areas of our supply chain, the effectiveness of our programming, our profitability at an SKU level, as well as product mix to create a better [ port ] sales. In the process, the elimination of ink to volume made paper organic net sales in the near term. In addition, key commodity inflation and price volatility in both cheese and meats is likely to remain a challenge in both Q4 and into next year. While we are implementing pricing in both these areas, reaction in the market remains unclear at this point. So as always, we will need to balance market share, distribution and profitability. 
And finally, please note that the divestitures we closed earlier this year will and unfavorable currency may continue to temper our reported results in the near term. At EBITDA, we are focused on continuous improvement with the goal of stabilizing constant currency adjusted EBITDA, excluding divestitures on a year-on-year basis. As mentioned, our visibility on net inflation within our supply chain is improving. We also have significant scope to drive the business forward through greater investments in media that we are determined to make happen. So far, we have been encouraged by our ability to find and fund efficiencies to help offset inflation and to help fund those investments in [indiscernible]. That said, we are still defining our interest price strategy and finalizing our broader ambition to see if more will be needed. 
So far as guidance goes, we continue to think it would not be productive for the organization to provide specific point-estimate financial guidance. I will tell you, however, in recognizing that we are still at early stages, it would be prudent to expect year-on-year top and bottom line performance in Q4 to be generally similar to what we saw in Q3. And from an earnings per share perspective, while we have delivered better-than-expected income and expenses below adjusted EBITDA, we still expect these items to be unfavorable on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. Collectively, we expect these below-the-line items to negatively impact EPS by up to $0.10 versus the prior year in Q4. 
Now before we move to Q&A, there is another area I think is important to address in terms of progress to date, where we currently stand and where we go from here, and that is our capital structure. Here, we have been making significant progress against our balance sheet priorities, and we believe they have strong credit momentum to build on. From the merger to the end of 2018, we diligently reduced gross debt by $2.4 billion. In Q3, we announced an additional $2.3 billion of cash-funded debt take-out that was enabled by a combination of divestiture proceeds and solid cash generation. And along the way, we have taken a number of actions to put our [ patience ] in an overfunded stock and have prefunded most of our post-retirement benefit obligations. As a result, we have minimum future contribution requirements going forward. Also in Q3, we undertook a successful leverage near to $3 billion refinance that further strengths our liquidity. We have a strong investor participation in our offering that we think reinforced investor confidence. And this refinance gives us significant flexibility through 2025, especially given the fact that we currently have no commercial paper outstanding and a $4 billion revolving credit facility that has never been drawn. Refinancing our debt as well as establishing our long-term strategy are critical steps to defining how we will continue to deleverage our company and maintain our investment-grade status.
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

From day 1, when I looked at the past and I saw that there was a  pretty big deterioration of gross profit because of decrease of COGS, we made -- we defined supply as a big area for improvement for 2 reasons. First, because we had pretty big disruptions in the past with our customers for -- because of low service levels. But second, because COGS has been increasing in our company. And I do not see a reason for that. I think that if we changed the mentality to the company for a mentality of continuous improvement, if we invest on that, on people, in our factories, in our way of thinking on believing if we change the mentality from basically cost-cutting into continuous improvement, I think we can do it and we should do it. And as you said, I see it as a great source of -- for investment in the business. I was very glad to see that in this quarter, we could stabilize cost of goods sold. And this is big for us.

Specifically, let me start specifically with the SKUs that you are mentioning, and then I go -- I'll tell you overall my point of view about that. I think we -- the company has been on a frenzy of innovation in the last 2 to 3 years and trying through launching new products to compensate the decline in net sales. We have not been successful on that. We really have not been successful on that. Yes, we brought a lot of complexity to the system but this innovation was not translated into additional sales. It was very cannibalistic and brought much more complexity. And as a consequence, a lot of supply chain losses and lower margins. Many of this innovation was done through third-party manufacturers. So of course, that's, for me, when I arrived and with fresh eyes, I asked the obvious questions and one of them is, let me understand profitability by SKU, let me understand volume by SKU, and there's a big tail of SKUs that, yes, actually, with a negative margin or are not important at all, very, very small or both. And that can just generate a lot of complexity in the system. And so yes, we are going to reduce this, we are going to reduce. We have to have the discipline that, at the same time that we innovate and we put new products in the market. We have to have the discipline to clean the tail of low margin, negative margin or a low volume, very low volume, that are really not just creating more complexity in the system. And this is a capability. So going back to your point about capabilities. I think that innovation is an area that we have to increase, we'll have to improve dramatically. There are other areas that I think that we have to improve our capabilities. And -- but I think that innovation is one that I'm very focused on. It is a big driver for growth for the future, has to be especially in the food industry, but we have to do bigger innovation. We have to do fewer innovation. We have to do bolder innovation. We have to do profitable innovation and has to be incremental instead of doing everything and old products innovating and vouching and throwing new products in the market that will not really generate extra profitability to our company."

Are you going to give us kind of a ramp of what those next 3 years might look like when you give us the review?
And then secondly, a more detailed question. In your conversations with customers, have you found that customers are giving you any kind of insight on their perception of Kraft versus your peers? My perception is that Kraft has had some pretty rigid structures in terms of pay-for-performance with customers, and maybe that led to some of the disputes that you've had in the past. Is there any insight you can give us in that regard?"

Let me answer first the first one, Robert. I'm working at the same time in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019 on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right?

I'm working at the same time in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019 on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right? For 2020, I need the strategy, but this -- 2020 is going to be more about continued stabilization. And then this is what I aim, is that 2020 is a year that we stabilize the business and that we build the foundation for growth in 2021. So the answer to you is yes, when we present the strategy that we are working on, that is going to be a long term with a long-term view. So we -- our 3-year plan will be addressed. Regarding customers, yes, I've been talking to customers and learning a lot from them. And I can tell you that their biggest concern is what you call the disputes and then that translates into service levels. So we had problems in the past, several problems in different types of products with our service level. And that although we haven't had any big problem this year, so we are in a much better year in terms of service level, there are still scars from the past. And then when they remind us of all the problems that we had in the previous years in terms of service level, they questioned that if this is sustainable or not. They also -- so this, I would say, that is -- their #1 concern, really, service level. But they're also concerned about planning and strategy. So we need to be better on our planning with them and adapt our planning cycle to their planning cycle. I think there's a big opportunity to do that, and we are going to address that. At this moment, because of the way we are planned -- that we plan on our budget cycle that doesn't tie with their budget cycle, the feeling I have is that we are always late and the feeling that they have is the same. The other part is related to strategy that they want to see us communicating to them and teaching them and is training them in a more strategic way on a long term. And then I would put a fourth point that the -- that is about execution, that we can have better execution in their stores. So I would say that these are the 4 items that we -- that I'm -- when I think about customers that I'm focused on, really, service level, planning, strategy and execution."

If we go back to EBITDA for fiscal '17 and then compare it to where we are the last 12 months, there's an EBITDA decline of about $1.6 billion or so. And can you give us a little -- a bridge of kind of what the drivers were that got us from there to here?

So thanks for the question. When you go back from our peak 2017 margins. And again, when you bridge these 2, let's say, our last 12, as I said, pretty much we have 2 big drivers, 2 big areas of decline, right? 60% of the decline roughly is coming from gross margin. And this -- you could split this in mainly the inflation we have in our supply chain with not enough initiatives to offset that; investments that we had in service level for the customers; an unfavorable product mix that we saw in the launch of the business, and this is part of the type of incrementality, the innovation that we had that Miguel was talking about. And also, the fact that with all of this inflation and not enough savings or efficiency initiatives to offset that, we were slow in moving our prices. So I think this is pretty much 60% of the gap. The other 30% of the gap is driven by SG&A. So 60-plus around gross margin, 25% to 30% around SG&A. 70% of that was pretty much commercial investments we made. We had international go-to-market initiatives, new areas inside the company like digital and also additional market investments that we put that is -- because of our fragmentation of innovation, ended up going too much to nonworking piece to support the innovation pipeline.
So -- and the remaining, also we have like of 30% of the 25% from the SG&A is pretty much lapping bonds accrual that we didn't have in 2017. So a 6% gross margin, 30% SG&A, with 70% of this 30% coming from these commercial investments that we made that we are assessing now. The other 30% of the 25% decline, driven by bonds that we didn't have in 2017. I think it's -- on that, I think it's -- and we, internally here, and myself specifically, we reflect a lot about this, the performance and the root cause of this performance. And we had big leaks of key learnings here and things that we're going to go after and things that came from the outside. That's pretty much at the base of all these initiatives, near-term projects that we have. But at the end of the day, pretty much we were not kind of fast enough to move from that first initial integration stage to build this organic growth plan for the company. In a moment that the industry had a lot of big transformations, right, both from the customers' lens, from the retailers' lens. So I think that was the combination of the things that I think drove our past 3 years' performance down. But now I think the offense is that we built these work streams with Miguel to address those things through -- again, we had a lot of costs inside the business. And now we are reassessing each of them the ability for us to get back them to be able to help to fund all the investments that we are identifying as opportunities in the business. And what we can share also here is that so far, we found a lot of opportunities to invest, as Miguel was saying, behind media, behind higher support from a more concentrated set of innovation. And so far, we were able to find the sources inside the company to fund those investments. Again, of course, we are still working on the strategy and later price, that we expect to find more areas of opportunity and also more areas of savings to support potentially those investments."

So a very good question. And I'll tell you, I think that there's a fundamental change that -- or we need to do a fundamental change in the company, from a company that was much more focused on today and probably pursuing a strategy that was more focused on inorganic growth to a company that needs to pursue organic growth and needs to understand the future better than anybody else. That's a big change. You need to change, you need to put first the mindset in a direction.
Second, really a strategy, where do we think that the growth is going  to happen? So we need to transform this company into a much more consumer-driven company in a much more looking-forward type of company rather than just operating the present. It's not either one or the other. We need to do both. And I think that we can and we should do both. So as a consequence, I think that the innovation was we did a lot of plan extensions. We were relying too much on things that were not really incremental and we need to do more things in areas that we believe are going to grow. The last call, I gave the example of Boca, and I think is a good example. We were the first company introducing veggie burgers 15 years ago. But because we didn't have a good vision about how the world would progress, Boca has not been a focused brand. And as a consequence, we never really took advantage of  everything that is happening in this area. So understanding the future, understanding the consumer, I think, is the way to go. Of course that -- for that, we will need much more better insight, much better creativity. We'll need a more united R&D. So we didn't have a Head of R&D. R&D was in all departments of the company. We are now unifying R&D in the company, having one head of R&D. We are defining our strategy. We also appointed a Chief Growth Officer. Pull things into this direction, right. Hopefully, I was -- I gave you the answer you were expecting, John. I don't know if you want to ask anything else related to that."

And how do you think about some of the considerations of, if you have fewer brands in the portfolio moving forward, or the priority is to paying down debt? So to sum up, the question would really be, what are the very obvious considerations of keeping it versus not keeping it? And then what would be some of the unintended consequences that maybe most investors might not see from our vantage point?"

And developing this plan, for sure, as you can imagine, like capital structure is a key chapter of this as I said. And for us, being an investment-grade company is -- remains very, very important.

What's your personal philosophy or strategy as you think about the patience to seed and build growth and, call it, longer-term categories? They might not be very large today, but might be the future of, call it, the portfolio or areas that could be a few hundred million dollar brands. So I guess to sum up, the question would really be, how does a company that's so ZBB focused think about immediate return on investment versus necessarily seeding and needing to grow for the longer term?"

In my previous company, I worked for 22 years and I learned to love ZBB. But for one reason, because ZBB was a big lever or made it possible to grow the business throughout the year. So when I look at ZBB, I look at it as a discipline to make things every day better, so we can free up resources to invest in other products. I don't look at ZBB as a way to basically cut costs and cut costs. I see it as a way to do things better every day and have -- the consequence of that is to be more efficient and to free up resources to invest in the business.
But addressing your second point about how are you going to invest in things that today are small, and tomorrow can be big, are you going to have that discipline? I think that question is very, very important. I think companies tend to invest on what's big and not what it will grow, and I think we need to do both. And then we really need to understand what will grow and bet on it. It may be smaller today, but you need to have the patience to nurture these categories, these products, these brands to be big one day. I'm looking at this right now, not only brands but also channels that today may not be so representative, but have a great potential for the future. So I tend to agree with you, and I don't think that, that has to do with ZBB. It's just the opposite. I think that ZBB will free up resources to invest in these categories."

And I tell you, I think that is basically because it's not very important in each one of the countries and also because we really do not have expertise, really expertise, big expertise on baby food. And if you look at the countries individually, we don't even have the scale, I think, to have this expertise. Now with the changes that we made in structure, with the appointment of Rafael as our Zone President International when we put Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe together, then he will have all this business or basically all this business together and becomes meaningful in his portfolio. He will put a team working on baby food. Understanding what moves baby food, understanding these sites, understanding the trends, understanding the needs of the moms and the babies that, because of scale, we didn't have today in each one of these countries. So it's a good example of capabilities that we have to build that by changing structure, we can get there. So that would be my comment about baby food."

On our previous call, I promised to be candid with you from the start and to update you on our progress along the way. I also highlighted some potential risks to the second half performance. 3 months on, and we are getting to deeply understand our business. That business is on a better footing because we are increasing visibility and control of our costs. The team is making excellent progress and we are gaining confidence in our path forward. We are not where we believe we can be, but we are excited with the evolution we had in the third quarter and what we have ahead of us. This comes from directing our efforts to 3 work streams: stabilizing the business as we execute the 2019 plan; setting our near-term transformation in motion; and establishing a true north through our enterprise strategy work. As we committed to you earlier, we will give you a detailed plan coming out of the enterprise strategy work early next year. But we do want to share the progress we have made and set early high-level observations with you today. 
In terms of delivering our 2019 plan and how we are running the business day-to-day, our performance improved from the first half of the year, and we are seeing signs of continuous improvement taking hold. As I said on our last call, my #1 focus is our people and developing the team because it's our people that will deliver continuous improvement and the turnaround of Kraft Heinz. Since our last call, we have made a number of moves to enhance our leadership team, both at the global level and within business units. For instance, I named Nina Barton to a new role, Chief Growth Officer, where in addition to leading the development of our enterprise strategy, Nina has responsibility for overall channel growth, global e-commerce and digital innovation, marketing services and R&D.
In Finance, our need is to move with speed and have in place proven well-respected leaders that know the business from the start. With that, I'm delighted to have Paulo Basilio back to the position of Global CFO and also Andre Maciel to be our Head of the U.S. Finance, a job he held for the first few years following the merger. To build morale and ensure a high level of engagement, I have held 9 town halls and put out roughly 20 internal videos to shine a spotlight of activities that employees across the world, across Heinz, are doing to address the company. In this past month, we held a global Kraft Heinz Meal Packathon where employees from 15 locations across 9 countries got together with Rise Against Hunger to pack 1 million meals for children in need. Not only we reached the target, but we overdelivered by packing more than 1.2 million meals. And although we have still a lot to do to build our bench strength, in terms of recruiting, I'm very encouraged by the number of people we've seen that want to be part of our turnaround. Results-wise, organic net sales growth was up slightly on a sequential basis. And year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA was down roughly 4.5% in Q3 on a constant currency basis versus 16% in the first half.
Pricing is coming through and inflecting from negative deposit in both United States and EMEA, with overall elasticity in line with our expectations. Net inflation in our supply chain costs falling from 3.3% in the first half of the year to below 1% in the third quarter, marking the first quarter since 2017 that we have been seeing stability on the cost side. And we began to lap stepped-up marketing and e-commerce spending and investments in sales and customer service from the previous year. In addition, we are seeing significant positive momentum where we have something to say, and this includes mid-single-digit retail takeaway in our U.S. condiments and sauces, cream cheese, snacks, desserts and seasonal franchise. In Ketchup, specifically, we are getting great traction around the world behind our Heinz 150th anniversary, including our first-ever global Heinz campaign featuring pop music star, Ed Sheeran. And our total U.S. sauces business, which includes ketchup, mustard, mayo, Miracle Whip, salad dressings and pasta sauce, has continued to build momentum since 2017.
Brazil is growing double digits in both retail and foodservice channels, and we are seeing solid growth of 14% in our China soy sauce business. 
At the same time, we are still far from where we should be. While overall performance is improving, our numbers are still negative versus the prior year, and our performance remains uneven across categories and across geographies. This includes ongoing share and distribution losses within our natural cheese, cold cuts and coffee business in the United States, lower-than-anticipated promotional lifts in Canada, ongoing infant nutrition declines in both EMEA and China as well as increasing supply chain costs in our Rest of the World segment. To change our trajectory, we must improve our execution around the category, brand and sales initiatives by making critical fixes and closing any capability gaps; and drive greater efficiency in our supply chain across procurement, manufacturing and distribution. So while we have been working hard to finish the year in a much better place than we started, we have also been investing a lot of energy in our future. We are developing 9 transformational projects that touch the core areas of our company to improve our capabilities and make us a more efficient company. Our teams are making rapid progress understanding root causes, defining what needs to be done and already taking some actions that will benefit 2020. 
The 9 projects currently underway includes 5 projects focused on top line, 2 projects focused on operational efficiencies and 2 projects focused on organizational effectiveness.
Slide 10 shows our list of projects and the scope of each, but let me provide some examples to illustrate. In marketing, we are defining the framework and optimal marketing spend, both by brand and by working/nonworking allocations. And so far, we identified the opportunity to reallocate a substantial amount of dollars to work in within 2020 as well as redirect dollars disproportionately towards support of our flagship brands. Based on this alone, we will see a significant percentage increase in media spend and an even greater increase for the brands that are the biggest drivers of our profitability. Around our innovation efforts, we are revamping our product development process so we can be faster and more consumer-centric with our new products. And we are evaluating shifting innovation support to fewer, bigger, better initiatives, launches that promise to be more incremental to our base. As a result, in 2020, we will reduce the number of projects being launched by half and better align our post-2020 pipeline with our enterprise strategy. 
In sales, the work is concentrated in 3 areas. First, strengthening day-to-day execution through ways of working and timing of our planning process to tighten the connectivity between sales, our category teams, and more importantly, with our retail partners.  Second is developing a road map for price, mix, promotion and trade improvements. And third is developing a channel strategy, better defined roles and priorities for each part of the portfolio, by channel and by customer. In supply chain, we have several projects underway that collectively can deliver significant efficiencies to help offset inflation with the goal of funding our long-term strategy. A key driver of this will be examining every SKU, cutting anything with a negative margin, and in the process, removing complexity from the system to boost productivity and improve mix. Based on our work to date, we see scope to rationalize a significant portion of the SKUs in our U.S. business and with minimal impact on profits. There is also more work being done elsewhere, including the transformation of our financial planning and forecasting that Paulo is heading up. 
Taking a step back, I think it's important to recognize here that even though we are putting things in motion now, the purpose of all these projects is to lay a foundation that will support us for the long run. 
Finally, regarding the long term, in the third quarter, we initiated and we are on track with the development of our enterprise strategy. We are developing a much better understanding of the consumer with a view to the future. We are setting our strategic direction, where we believe we can drive the greatest growth and returns by brand, by category, by geography and by channel with the full support and participation of our Board. And we are assessing how best to organize ourselves against our biggest opportunities. There is still much work ahead of us, but we remain confident in our ability to launch our enterprise strategy and share it in detail with you early next year. Personally, I'm encouraged and excited at how our people are embracing change, their desire to get better through new ways of doing things and to move with speed. After all, these are the key ingredients to building a continuous improvement mindset. And as I said on the last call, one of our key principles and goals for the company going forward is not only to identify the new investments needed to grow both the top line and the bottom line, but keeping expenses under control and using that capital to support those investments.
With that, I will turn over to Paulo to discuss where we are and where we expect to go from here on the financial front."

I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved ve",1119,"Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved versus the first half, with organic net sales down 1.1%. Pricing turned from negative in the first half to positive in the quarter. This was driven by realization of the pricing actions we announced in the first part of the year in the United States and EMEA as well as ongoing pricing to offset inflation in Latin America. Vol/mix was lower versus the prior year as we are lapping the strong gains in the prior year and continue to see unfavorable changes in retail inventory levels versus the prior year. In Q3, retail inventory change resulted in a negative 110 basis point impact to U.S. vol/mix. That translated into a roughly 80 basis point decline versus the prior year for total Kraft Heinz results. And for the fourth quarter, I will note here that we currently expect a roughly 50 basis point headwind from lower retail inventory levels for our U.S. business. 
With respect to profitability, EBITDA is beginning to stabilize. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was down 4.6% versus the prior year. And this includes a roughly 1.5 percentage point negative impact from divestitures. Excluding these factors, the reduction in EBITDA was driven by a mix of negatives and positives. On the positive side, we are getting supply chain costs under control in the U.S. EMEA returned to EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis. And we had favorable timing of marketing and selling expenses in the U.S. versus the prior year. At the same time, supply chain costs were still negative year-on-year on a global basis in Q3, driven by higher supply chain losses in the Rest of the World markets. A combination of lower pricing and higher input costs led to another weak performance versus the prior year in Canada, and both of these need to be fixed going forward. 
Finally, at adjusted EPS, Q3 results were better than we anticipated 3 months ago. This is mainly due to a combination of a better-than-expected outcome in other income and expenses due to favorable FX gains, favorable order income that we do not expect to repeat, lower-than-expected interest expense as a result of successful refinancing as well as more favorable discrete items in the tax line. With respect to our effective tax rate, we are now expecting a rate in between 19% and 20% for the full year versus the 21% expected previously, which brings me to our financial outlook and near-term expectations. 
On a personal note, it was an honor when Miguel and the Board asked me to step back into the CFO role here at Kraft Heinz. Much has changed since I last held it. As Miguel has been saying, this period calls for new thinking and new ways of doing business. One area that I believe must be of greater focus is the company trajectory in gross profit. As mentioned, we are revisiting the efficiency in many areas of our supply chain, the effectiveness of our programming, our profitability at an SKU level, as well as product mix to create a better pool of sales. In the process, the elimination of ink to volume made paper organic net sales in the near term. In addition, key commodity inflation and price volatility in both cheese and. meats is likely to remain a challenge in both Q4 and into next year. While we are implementing pricing in both these areas, reaction in the market remains unclear at this point. So as always, we will need to balance market share, distribution and profitability. 
And finally, please note that the divestitures we closed earlier this year will and unfavorable currency may continue to temper our reported results in the near term. At EBITDA, we are focused on continuous improvement with the goal of stabilizing constant currency adjusted EBITDA, excluding divestitures on a year-on-year basis. As mentioned, our visibility on net inflation within our supply chain is improving. We also have significant scope to drive the business forward through greater investments in media that we are determined to make happen. So far, we have been encouraged by our ability to find and fund efficiencies to help offset inflation and to help fund those investments entirely. That said, we are still defining our interest price strategy and finalizing our broader ambition to see if more will be needed. 
So far as guidance goes, we continue to think it would not be productive for the organization to provide specific point-estimate financial guidance. I will tell you, however, in recognizing that we are still at early stages, it would be prudent to expect year-on-year top and bottom line performance in Q4 to be generally similar to what we saw in Q3. And from an earnings per share perspective, while we have delivered better-than-expected income and expenses below adjusted EBITDA, we still expect these items to be unfavorable on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. Collectively, we expect these below-the-line items to negatively impact EPS by up to $0.10 versus the prior year in Q4. 
Now before we move to Q&A, there is another area I think is important to address in terms of progress to date, where we currently stand and where we go from here, and that is our capital structure. Here, we have been making significant progress against our balance sheet priorities, and we believe they have to have strong credit momentum to build on. From the merger through the end of 2018, we diligently reduced gross debt by $2.4 billion. In Q3, we announced an additional $2.3 billion of cash-funded debt take-out that was enabled by a combination of divestiture proceeds and solid cash generation. And along the way, we have taken a number of actions to put our pensions in an overfunded stock and have prefunded most of our post-retirement benefit obligations. As a result, we have minimum future contribution requirements going forward. Also in Q3, we undertook a successful leverage near to $3 billion refinance that further strengthens our liquidity. We have a strong investor participation in our offering that we think reinforced investor confidence. And this refinance gives us significant flexibility through 2025, especially given the fact that we currently have no commercial paper outstanding and a $4 billion revolving credit facility that has never been drawn. Refinancing our debt as well as establishing our long-term strategy are critical steps to defining how we will continue to deleverage our company and maintain our investment-grade status.
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

And the best -- better visibility in cost and net inflation. So we are expecting pretty much in sales and EBITDA similar year-over-year performance as we saw in Q3. And below the line, we are expecting roughly $0.10 -- up to $0.10 headwind versus prior year. So pretty much that's how we're seeing Q4 performing in this year."

From day 1, when I looked at the past and I saw that there was a  pretty big deterioration of gross profit because of decrease of COGS, we made -- we defined supply as a big area for improvement for 2 reasons. First, because we had pretty big disruptions in the past with our customers for -- because of low service levels but second, because COGS has been increasing in our company. And I do not see a reason for that. I think that if we changed the mentality to the company for a mentality of continuous improvement, if we invest on that, on people, in our factories, in our way of thinking, on believing if we change the mentality from basically cost-cutting into continuous improvement, I think we can do it and we should do it. And as you said, I see it as a great source of -- for investment in the business. I was very glad to see that in this quarter, we could stabilize cost of goods sold. And this is big for us. We are all relieved with that. It's just the first step. Everything to be proved, but the first step was good and gives us a lot of faith, a lot of hope that we are in the right direction."

Specifically, let me start specifically with the SKUs that you are mentioning, and then I go -- I'll tell you overall my point of view about that. I think we -- the company has been on a frenzy of innovation in the last 2 to 3 years and trying through launching new products to compensate the decline in net sales. We have not been successful on that. We really have not been successful on that. Yes, we brought a lot of complexity to the system but this innovation was not translated into additional sales. It was very cannibalistic and brought much more complexity. And as a consequence, a lot of supply chain losses and lower margins. Many of this innovation was done through third-party manufacturers. So of course, that's, for me, when I arrived and with fresh eyes, I asked the obvious questions and one of them is, let me understand profitability by SKU, let me understand volume by SKU, and there's a big tail of SKUs that, yes, actually, with a negative margin or are not important at all, are very, very small or both, and that can just generate a lot of complexity in the system. And so yes, we are going to reduce this, we are going to reduce. We have to have the discipline that, at the same time that we innovate and we put new products in the market. We have to have the discipline to clean the tail of low margin, negative margin or a low volume, very low volume, that are really not just creating more complexity in the system. And this is a capability. So going back to your point about capabilities. I think that innovation is an area that we have to increase, we'll have to improve dramatically. There are other areas that I think that we have to improve our capabilities. And -- but I think that innovation is one that I'm very focused on. It is a big driver for growth for the future, has to be especially in the food industry, but we have to do bigger innovation. We have to do fewer innovation. We have to do bolder innovation. We have to do profitable innovation and has to be incremental instead of doing everything and old products innovating and vouching and throwing new products in the market that will not really generate extra profitability to our company."

Are you going to give us kind of a ramp of what those next 3 years might look like when you give us the review?
And then secondly, a more detailed question. In your conversations with customers, have you found that customers are giving you any kind of insight on their perception of Kraft versus your peers? My perception is that Kraft has had some pretty rigid structures in terms of pay-for-performance with customers, and maybe that led to some of the disputes that you've had in the past. Is there any insight you can give us in that regard?"

Let me answer first the first one, Robert. I'm working at the same time in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019, on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right?

I'm working at the same time in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019, on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right? For 2020, I need the strategy, but this -- 2020 is going to be more about continued stabilization. And then this is what I aim, is that 2020 is a year that we stabilize the business and that we build the foundation for growth in 2021. So the answer to you is yes, when we present the strategy that we are working on, that is going to be a long term with a long-term view. So we -- our 3-year plan will be addressed. Regarding customers, yes, I've been talking to customers and learning a lot from them. And I can tell you that their biggest concern is what you call the disputes and then that translates into service levels. So we had problems in the past, several problems in different types of products with our service level. And that although we haven't had any big problem this year, so we are in a much better year in terms of service level, there are still scars from the past. And then when they remind us of all the problems that we had in the previous years in terms of service level, they questioned that if this is sustainable or not. They also -- so this, I would say, that is -- their #1 concern, is really service level. But they're also concerned about planning and strategy. So we need to be better on our planning with them and adapt our planning cycle to their planning cycle. I think there's a big opportunity to do that, and we are going to address that. At this moment, because of the way we are planned -- that we plan on our budget cycle that doesn't tie with their budget cycle, the feeling I have is that we are always late and the feeling that they have is the same. The other part is related to strategy that they want to see us communicating to them and teaching them and is training them in a more strategic way on a long term. And then I would put a fourth point that the -- that is about execution, that we can have better execution in their stores. So I would say that these are the 4 items that we -- that I'm -- when I think about customers that I'm focused on, really, service level, planning, strategy and execution."

If we go back to EBITDA for fiscal '17 and then compare it to where we are the last 12 months, there's an EBITDA decline of about $1.6 billion or so. And can you give us a little -- a bridge of kind of what the drivers were that got us from there to here?

When you go back from our peak 2017 margins -- and again, when you bridge these 2, let's say, our last 12, as I said, pretty much we have 2 big drivers, 2 big areas of decline, right? 60% of the decline roughly is coming",597,"Sure. So thanks for the question. When you go back from our peak 2017 margins -- and again, when you bridge these 2, let's say, our last 12, as I said, pretty much we have 2 big drivers, 2 big areas of decline, right? 60% of the decline roughly is coming from gross margin. And this -- you could split this in mainly the inflation we have in our supply chain with not enough initiatives to offset that; investments that we had in service level for the customers; an unfavorable product mix that we saw in the launch of the business, and this is part of the type of incrementality, the innovation that we had that Miguel was talking about. And also, the fact that with all of this inflation and not enough savings or efficiency initiatives to offset that, we were slow in moving our prices. So I think this is pretty much 60% of the gap. The other 30% of the gap is driven by SG&A. So 60-plus around gross margin, 25% to 30% around SG&A. 70% of that was pretty much commercial investments we made. We had international go-to-market initiatives, new areas inside the company like digital and also additional market investments that we put that is -- because of our fragmentation of innovation, ended up going too much to nonworking piece to support the innovation pipeline.
So -- and the remaining, also we have like of 30% of the 25% from the SG&A is pretty much lapping bonds accrual that we didn't have in 2017. So a 6% gross margin, 30% SG&A, with 70% of this 30% coming from these commercial investments that we made that we are assessing now. The other 30% of the 25% decline, driven by bonds that we didn't have in 2017. I think it's -- on that, I think it's -- and we, internally here, and myself specifically, we reflect a lot about this, the performance and the root cause of this performance. And we had big leaks of key learnings here and things that we're going to go after and things that came from the outside. That's pretty much at the base of all these initiatives, near-term projects that we have. But at the end of the day, pretty much we were not kind of fast enough to move from that first initial integration stage to build this organic growth plan for the company. In a moment that the industry had a lot of big transformations, right, both from the customers' lens, from the retailers' lens. So I think that was the combination of the things that I think drove our past 3 years' performance down. But now I think the offense is that we built these work streams with Miguel to address those things through -- again, we had a lot of costs inside the business. And now we are reassessing each of them, the ability for us to get back them to be able to help to fund all the investments that we are identifying as opportunities in the business. And what we can share also here is that, so far, we found a lot of opportunities to invest, as Miguel was saying, behind media, behind higher support from a more concentrated set of innovation. And so far, we were able to find the sources inside the company to fund those investments. Again, of course, we are still working on the strategy and later price, that we expect to find more areas of opportunity and also more areas of savings to support potentially those investments."

So a very good question. And I'll tell you what, I think that there's a fundamental change that -- or we need to do a fundamental change in the company, from a company that was much more focused on today and probably pursuing a strategy that was more focused on inorganic growth to a company that needs to pursue organic growth and needs to understand the future better than anybody else. That's a big change. You need to change, you need to put first the mindset in a direction.
Second, really a strategy. Where do we think that the growth is going to happen? So we need to transform this company into a much more consumer-driven company in a much more looking-forward type of company rather than just operating the present. It's not either one or the other, we need to do both. And I think that we can and we should do both. So as a consequence, I think that the innovation was we did a lot of plan extensions. We were relying too much on things that were not really incremental and we need to do more things in areas that we believe are going to grow. The last call, I gave the example of Boca, and I think is a good example. We were the first company introducing veggie burgers 15 years ago. But because we didn't have a good vision about how the world would progress, Boca has not been a focused brand. And as a consequence, we never really took advantage of everything that is happening in this area. So understanding the future, understanding the consumer, I think, is the way to go. Of course that -- for that, we will need much more -- better insight, much better creativity. We'll need a more united R&D. So we didn't have a Head of R&D. R&D was in all departments of the company. We are now unifying R&D in the company, having one head of R&D. We are defining our strategy. We also appointed a Chief Growth Officer. Pull things into this direction, right. Hopefully, I was -- I gave you the answer you were expecting, John. I don't know if you want to ask anything else related to that."

What's your personal philosophy or strategy as you think about the patience to seed and build growth in, call it, longer-term categories that might not be very large today, but might be the future of, call it, the portfolio or areas that could be a few hundred million dollar brands? So I guess to sum up, the question would really be, how does a company that's so ZBB focused think about immediate return on investment versus necessarily seeding and needing to grow for the longer term?"

In my previous company, I worked for 22 years and I learned to love ZBB. But for one reason, because ZBB was a big lever or made it possible to grow the business throughout the year. So when I look at ZBB, I look at it as a discipline to make things every day better, so we can free up resources to invest in other products. I don't look at ZBB as a way to basically cut costs and cut costs. I see it as a way to do things better every day and have -- the consequence of that is to be more efficient and to free up resources to invest in the business.
But addressing your second point about how are you going to invest in things that today are small, and tomorrow can be big, are you going to have that discipline? I think that question is very, very important. I think companies tend to invest only in what's big and not to what it will grow, and I think we need to do both. And then we really need to understand what will grow and bet on it. It may be smaller today, but you need to have the patience to nurture these categories, these products, these brands to be big one day. I'm looking at this right now, and not only brands but also channels that today may not be so representative, but have a great potential for the future. So I tend to agree with you, and I don't think that, that has to do with ZBB. It's just the opposite. I think that ZBB will free up resources to invest in these categories."

But all very tiny business. But when you put them together, it's $0.5 billion business, it's sizable. We are declining in the majority of these countries. And I tell you, I think that is basically because it's not very important in each one of the countries and also because we really do not have expertise, really expertise, big expertise on baby food. And if you look at the countries individually, we don't even have the scale, I think, to have this expertise. Now with the changes that we made in structure, with the appointment of Rafael as our Zone President International when we put Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe together, then he will have all this business or basically all this business together and becomes meaningful in his portfolio. He will put a team working on baby food. Understanding what moves baby food, understanding these sites, understanding the trends, understanding the needs of the moms and the babies that, because of scale, we didn't have today in each one of these countries. So it's a good example of capabilities that we have to build that by changing structure, we can get there. So that would be my comment about baby food."

On our previous call, I promised to be candid with you from the start and to update you on our progress along the way. I also highlighted some potential risks to the second half performance. 3 months on, and we are getting to deeply understand our business. That business is on a better footing because we are increasing visibility and control of our costs. The team is making excellent progress and we are gaining confidence in our path forward. We are not where we believe we can be, but we are excited with the evolution we had in the third quarter and what we have ahead of us. This comes from directing our efforts to 3 work streams: stabilizing the business as we execute the 2019 plan; setting our near-term transformation in motion; and establishing a true north through our enterprise strategy work. As we committed to you earlier, we will give you a detailed plan coming out of the enterprise strategy work early next year. But we do want to share the progress we have made and set early high-level observations with you today. 
In terms of delivering our 2019 plan and how we are running the business day-to-day, our performance improved from the first half of the year, and we are seeing signs of continuous improvement taking hold. As I said on our last call, my #1 focus is our people and developing the team because it's our people that will deliver continuous improvement and the turnaround of Kraft Heinz. Since our last call, we have made a number of moves to enhance our leadership team, both at the global level and within business units. For instance, I named Nina Barton to a new role, Chief Growth Officer, where in addition to leading the development of our enterprise strategy, Nina has responsibility for overall channel growth, global e-commerce and digital innovation, marketing services and R&D.
In Finance, our need is to move with speed and have in place proven well-respected leaders that know the business from the start. With that, I'm delighted to have Paulo Basilio back to the position of Global CFO and also Andre Maciel to be our Head of the U.S. Finance, a job he held for the first few years following the merger. To build morale and ensure a high level of engagement, I have held 9 town halls and put out roughly 20 internal videos to shine a spotlight of activities that employees across the world, across Heinz, are doing to address the company. In this past month, we held a global Kraft Heinz Meal Packathon where employees from 15 locations across 9 countries got together with Rise Against Hunger to pack 1 million meals for children in need. Not only we reached the target, but we overdelivered by packing more than 1.2 million meals. And although we have still a lot to do to build our bench strength, in terms of recruiting, I'm very encouraged by the number of people we've seen that want to be part of our turnaround. Results-wise, organic net sales growth was up slightly on a sequential basis. And year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA was down roughly 4.5% in Q3 on a constant currency basis versus 16% in the first half.
Pricing is coming through and inflecting from negative deposit in both United States and EMEA, with overall elasticity in line with our expectations. Net inflation in our supply chain costs falling from 3.3% in the first half of the year to below 1% in the third quarter, marking the first quarter since 2017 that we have been seeing stability on the cost side. And we began to lap stepped-up marketing and e-commerce spending and investments in sales and customer service from the previous year. In addition, we are seeing significant positive momentum where we have something to say, and this includes mid-single-digit retail takeaway in our U.S. condiments and sauces, cream cheese, snacks, desserts and seasonal franchise. In Ketchup, specifically, we are getting great traction around the world behind our Heinz 150th anniversary, including our first-ever global Heinz campaign featuring pop music star, Ed Sheeran. And our total U.S. sauces business, which includes ketchup, mustard, mayo, Miracle Whip, salad dressings and pasta sauce, has continued to build momentum since 2017.
Brazil is growing double digits in both retail and foodservice channels, and we are seeing solid growth of 14% in our China soy sauce business. 
At the same time, we are still far from where we should be. While overall performance is improving, our numbers are still negative versus the prior year, and our performance remains uneven across categories and across geographies. This includes ongoing share and distribution losses within our natural cheese, cold cuts and coffee business in the United States, lower-than-anticipated promotional lifts in Canada, ongoing infant nutrition declines in both EMEA and China as well as increasing supply chain costs in our Rest of the World segment. To change our trajectory, we must improve our execution around the category, brand and sales initiatives by making critical fixes and closing any capability gaps; and drive greater efficiency in our supply chain across procurement, manufacturing and distribution. So while we have been working hard to finish the year in a much better place than we started, we have also been investing a lot of energy in our future. We are developing 9 transformational projects that touch the core areas of our company to improve our capabilities and make us a more efficient company. Our teams are making rapid progress understanding root causes, defining what needs to be done and already taking some actions that will benefit 2020. 
The 9 projects currently underway includes 5 projects focused on top line, 2 projects focused on operational efficiencies and 2 projects focused on organizational effectiveness.
Slide 10 shows our list of projects and the scope of each, but let me provide some examples to illustrate. In marketing, we are defining the framework and optimal marketing spend, both by brand and by working/nonworking allocations. And so far, we identified the opportunity to reallocate a substantial amount of dollars to work in within 2020 as well as redirect dollars disproportionately towards support of our flagship brands. Based on this alone, we will see a significant percentage increase in media spend and an even greater increase for the brands that are the biggest drivers of our profitability. Around our innovation efforts, we are revamping our product development process so we can be faster and more consumer-centric with our new products. And we are evaluating shifting innovation support to fewer, bigger, better initiatives, launches that promise to be more incremental to our base. As a result, in 2020, we will reduce the number of projects being launched by half and better align our post-2020 pipeline with our enterprise strategy. 
In sales, the work is concentrated in 3 areas. First, strengthening day-to-day execution through ways of working and timing of our planning process to tighten the connectivity between sales, our category teams, and more importantly, with our retail partners.  Second is developing a road map for price, mix, promotion and trade improvements. And third is developing a channel strategy, better defined roles and priorities for each part of the portfolio, by channel and by customer. In supply chain, we have several projects underway that collectively can deliver significant efficiencies to help offset inflation with the goal of funding our long-term strategy. A key driver of this will be examining every SKU, cutting anything with a negative margin, and in the process, removing complexity from the system to boost productivity and improve mix. Based on our work to date, we see scope to rationalize a significant portion of the SKUs in our U.S. business and with minimal impact on profits. There is also more work being done elsewhere, including the transformation of our financial planning and forecasting that Paulo is heading up. 
Taking a step back, I think it's important to recognize here that even though we are putting things in motion now, the purpose of all these projects is to lay a foundation that will support us for the long run. 
Finally, regarding the long term, in the third quarter, we initiated and we are on track with the development of our enterprise strategy. We are developing a much better understanding of the consumer with a view to the future. We are setting our strategic direction, where we believe we can drive the greatest growth and returns by brand, by category, by geography and by channel with the full support and participation of our Board. And we are assessing how best to organize ourselves against our biggest opportunities. There is still much work ahead of us, but we remain confident in our ability to launch our enterprise strategy and share it in detail with you early next year. Personally, I'm encouraged and excited at how our people are embracing change, their desire to get better through new ways of doing things and to move with speed. After all, these are the key ingredients to building a continuous improvement mindset. And as I said on the last call, one of our key principles and goals for the company going forward is not only to identify the new investments needed to grow both the top line and the bottom line, but keeping expenses under control and using that capital to support those investments.
With that, I will turn over to Paulo to discuss where we are and where we expect to go from here on the financial front."

I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved ve",1119,"Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved versus the first half, with organic net sales down 1.1%. Pricing turned from negative in the first half to positive in the quarter. This was driven by realization of the pricing actions we announced in the first part of the year in the United States and EMEA as well as ongoing pricing to offset inflation in Latin America. Vol/mix was lower versus the prior year as we are lapping the strong gains in the prior year and continue to see unfavorable changes in retail inventory levels versus the prior year. In Q3, retail inventory change resulted in a negative 110 basis point impact to U.S. vol/mix. That translated into a roughly 80 basis point decline versus the prior year for total Kraft Heinz results. And for the fourth quarter, I will note here that we currently expect a roughly 50 basis point headwind from lower retail inventory levels for our U.S. business. 
With respect to profitability, EBITDA is beginning to stabilize. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was down 4.6% versus the prior year. And this includes a roughly 1.5 percentage point negative impact from divestitures. Excluding these factors, the reduction in EBITDA was driven by a mix of negatives and positives. On the positive side, we are getting supply chain costs under control in the U.S. EMEA returned to EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis. And we had favorable timing of marketing and selling expenses in the U.S. versus the prior year. At the same time, supply chain costs were still negative year-on-year on a global basis in Q3, driven by higher supply chain losses in the Rest of the World markets. A combination of lower pricing and higher input costs led to another weak performance versus the prior year in Canada, and both of these need to be fixed going forward. 
Finally, at adjusted EPS, Q3 results were better than we anticipated 3 months ago. This is mainly due to a combination of a better-than-expected outcome in other income and expenses due to favorable FX gains, favorable order income that we do not expect to repeat, lower-than-expected interest expense as a result of successful refinancing as well as more favorable discrete items in the tax line. With respect to our effective tax rate, we are now expecting a rate in between 19% and 20% for the full year versus the 21% expected previously, which brings me to our financial outlook and near-term expectations. 
On a personal note, it was an honor when Miguel and the Board asked me to step back into the CFO role here at Kraft Heinz. Much has changed since I last held it. As Miguel has been saying, this period calls for new thinking and new ways of doing business. One area that I believe must be of greater focus is the company trajectory in gross profit. As mentioned, we are revisiting the efficiency in many areas of our supply chain, the effectiveness of our programming, our profitability at an SKU level, as well as product mix to create a better pool of sales. In the process, the elimination of ink to volume made paper organic net sales in the near term. In addition, key commodity inflation and price volatility in both cheese and. meats is likely to remain a challenge in both Q4 and into next year. While we are implementing pricing in both these areas, reaction in the market remains unclear at this point. So as always, we will need to balance market share, distribution and profitability. 
And finally, please note that the divestitures we closed earlier this year will and unfavorable currency may continue to temper our reported results in the near term. At EBITDA, we are focused on continuous improvement with the goal of stabilizing constant currency adjusted EBITDA, excluding divestitures on a year-on-year basis. As mentioned, our visibility on net inflation within our supply chain is improving. We also have significant scope to drive the business forward through greater investments in media that we are determined to make happen. So far, we have been encouraged by our ability to find and fund efficiencies to help offset inflation and to help fund those investments entirely. That said, we are still defining our interest price strategy and finalizing our broader ambition to see if more will be needed. 
So far as guidance goes, we continue to think it would not be productive for the organization to provide specific point-estimate financial guidance. I will tell you, however, in recognizing that we are still at early stages, it would be prudent to expect year-on-year top and bottom line performance in Q4 to be generally similar to what we saw in Q3. And from an earnings per share perspective, while we have delivered better-than-expected income and expenses below adjusted EBITDA, we still expect these items to be unfavorable on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. Collectively, we expect these below-the-line items to negatively impact EPS by up to $0.10 versus the prior year in Q4. 
Now before we move to Q&A, there is another area I think is important to address in terms of progress to date, where we currently stand and where we go from here, and that is our capital structure. Here, we have been making significant progress against our balance sheet priorities, and we believe they have to have strong credit momentum to build on. From the merger through the end of 2018, we diligently reduced gross debt by $2.4 billion. In Q3, we announced an additional $2.3 billion of cash-funded debt take-out that was enabled by a combination of divestiture proceeds and solid cash generation. And along the way, we have taken a number of actions to put our pensions in an overfunded stock and have prefunded most of our post-retirement benefit obligations. As a result, we have minimum future contribution requirements going forward. Also in Q3, we undertook a successful leverage near to $3 billion refinance that further strengthens our liquidity. We have a strong investor participation in our offering that we think reinforced investor confidence. And this refinance gives us significant flexibility through 2025, especially given the fact that we currently have no commercial paper outstanding and a $4 billion revolving credit facility that has never been drawn. Refinancing our debt as well as establishing our long-term strategy are critical steps to defining how we will continue to deleverage our company and maintain our investment-grade status.
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

I realize you're probably not in a position yet to fully size this sort of opportunity. But I guess, do you see any structural reason that would preclude KHC from driving similar levels of sort of ongoing productivity as peers, let's say, as a percent of cost of goods. And the reason I ask is because I presume this is where it can be quite helpful in terms of funding the media spend investment that you mentioned today on the call, other things, inflation and such that come up all in the context of managing EBITDA to be more stable within the confines, I guess, of a constrained balance sheet. So perhaps, any color on that you can provide would be helpful."

From day 1, when I looked at the past and I saw that there was a  pretty big deterioration of gross profit because of decrease of COGS, we made -- we defined supply as a big area for improvement for 2 reasons. First, because we had pretty big disruptions in the past with our customers for -- because of low service levels but second, because COGS has been increasing in our company. And I do not see a reason for that. I think that if we changed the mentality to the company for a mentality of continuous improvement, if we invest on that, on people, in our factories, in our way of thinking, on believing if we change the mentality from basically cost-cutting into continuous improvement, I think we can do it and we should do it. And as you said, I see it as a great source of -- for investment in the business. I was very glad to see that in this quarter, we could stabilize cost of goods sold. And this is big for us. We are all relieved with that. It's just the first step. Everything to be proved, but the first step was good and gives us a lot of faith, a lot of hope that we are in the right direction."

And maybe related to that, the SKU reduction, is there anything related to like new insights, new capabilities that, that would -- now would be the time to look at reducing SKUs in North America?

Specifically, let me start specifically with the SKUs that you are mentioning, and then I go -- I'll tell you overall my point of view about that. I think we -- the company has been on a frenzy of innovation in the last 2 to 3 years and trying through launching new products to compensate the decline in net sales. We have not been successful on that. We really have not been successful on that. Yes, we brought a lot of complexity to the system but this innovation was not translated into additional sales. It was very cannibalistic and brought much more complexity. And as a consequence, a lot of supply chain losses and lower margins. Many of this innovation was done through third-party manufacturers. So of course, that's, for me, when I arrived and with fresh eyes, I asked the obvious questions and one of them is, let me understand profitability by SKU, let me understand volume by SKU, and there's a big tail of SKUs that, yes, actually, with a negative margin or are not important at all, are very, very small or both, and that can just generate a lot of complexity in the system. And so yes, we are going to reduce this, we are going to reduce. We have to have the discipline that, at the same time that we innovate and we put new products in the market. We have to have the discipline to clean the tail of low margin, negative margin or a low volume, very low volume, that are really not just creating more complexity in the system. And this is a capability. So going back to your point about capabilities. I think that innovation is an area that we have to increase, we'll have to improve dramatically. There are other areas that I think that we have to improve our capabilities. And -- but I think that innovation is one that I'm very focused on. It is a big driver for growth for the future, has to be especially in the food industry, but we have to do bigger innovation. We have to do fewer innovation. We have to do bolder innovation. We have to do profitable innovation and has to be incremental instead of doing everything and old products innovating and vouching and throwing new products in the market that will not really generate extra profitability to our company."

Are you going to give us kind of a ramp of what those next 3 years might look like when you give us the review?
And then secondly, a more detailed question. In your conversations with customers, have you found that customers are giving you any kind of insight on their perception of Kraft versus your peers? My perception is that Kraft has had some pretty rigid structures in terms of pay-for-performance with customers, and maybe that led to some of the disputes that you've had in the past. Is there any insight you can give us in that regard?"

Let me answer first the first one, Robert. I'm working at the same time in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019, on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right?

I'm working at the same time in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019, on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right? For 2020, I need the strategy, but this -- 2020 is going to be more about continued stabilization. And then this is what I aim, is that 2020 is a year that we stabilize the business and that we build the foundation for growth in 2021. So the answer to you is yes, when we present the strategy that we are working on, that is going to be a long term with a long-term view. So we -- our 3-year plan will be addressed. Regarding customers, yes, I've been talking to customers and learning a lot from them. And I can tell you that their biggest concern is what you call the disputes and then that translates into service levels. So we had problems in the past, several problems in different types of products with our service level. And that although we haven't had any big problem this year, so we are in a much better year in terms of service level, there are still scars from the past. And then when they remind us of all the problems that we had in the previous years in terms of service level, they questioned that if this is sustainable or not. They also -- so this, I would say, that is -- their #1 concern, is really service level. But they're also concerned about planning and strategy. So we need to be better on our planning with them and adapt our planning cycle to their planning cycle. I think there's a big opportunity to do that, and we are going to address that. At this moment, because of the way we are planned -- that we plan on our budget cycle that doesn't tie with their budget cycle, the feeling I have is that we are always late and the feeling that they have is the same. The other part is related to strategy that they want to see us communicating to them and teaching them and is training them in a more strategic way on a long term. And then I would put a fourth point that the -- that is about execution, that we can have better execution in their stores. So I would say that these are the 4 items that we -- that I'm -- when I think about customers that I'm focused on, really, service level, planning, strategy and execution."

If we go back to EBITDA for fiscal '17 and then compare it to where we are the last 12 months, there's an EBITDA decline of about $1.6 billion or so. And can you give us a little -- a bridge of kind of what the drivers were that got us from there to here?

When you go back from our peak 2017 margins -- and again, when you bridge these 2, let's say, our last 12, as I said, pretty much we have 2 big drivers, 2 big areas of decline, right? 60% of the decline roughly is coming",597,"Sure. So thanks for the question. When you go back from our peak 2017 margins -- and again, when you bridge these 2, let's say, our last 12, as I said, pretty much we have 2 big drivers, 2 big areas of decline, right? 60% of the decline roughly is coming from gross margin. And this -- you could split this in mainly the inflation we have in our supply chain with not enough initiatives to offset that; investments that we had in service level for the customers; an unfavorable product mix that we saw in the launch of the business, and this is part of the type of incrementality, the innovation that we had that Miguel was talking about. And also, the fact that with all of this inflation and not enough savings or efficiency initiatives to offset that, we were slow in moving our prices. So I think this is pretty much 60% of the gap. The other 30% of the gap is driven by SG&A. So 60-plus around gross margin, 25% to 30% around SG&A. 70% of that was pretty much commercial investments we made. We had international go-to-market initiatives, new areas inside the company like digital and also additional market investments that we put that is -- because of our fragmentation of innovation, ended up going too much to nonworking piece to support the innovation pipeline.
So -- and the remaining, also we have like of 30% of the 25% from the SG&A is pretty much lapping bonds accrual that we didn't have in 2017. So a 6% gross margin, 30% SG&A, with 70% of this 30% coming from these commercial investments that we made that we are assessing now. The other 30% of the 25% decline, driven by bonds that we didn't have in 2017. I think it's -- on that, I think it's -- and we, internally here, and myself specifically, we reflect a lot about this, the performance and the root cause of this performance. And we had big leaks of key learnings here and things that we're going to go after and things that came from the outside. That's pretty much at the base of all these initiatives, near-term projects that we have. But at the end of the day, pretty much we were not kind of fast enough to move from that first initial integration stage to build this organic growth plan for the company. In a moment that the industry had a lot of big transformations, right, both from the customers' lens, from the retailers' lens. So I think that was the combination of the things that I think drove our past 3 years' performance down. But now I think the offense is that we built these work streams with Miguel to address those things through -- again, we had a lot of costs inside the business. And now we are reassessing each of them, the ability for us to get back them to be able to help to fund all the investments that we are identifying as opportunities in the business. And what we can share also here is that, so far, we found a lot of opportunities to invest, as Miguel was saying, behind media, behind higher support from a more concentrated set of innovation. And so far, we were able to find the sources inside the company to fund those investments. Again, of course, we are still working on the strategy and later price, that we expect to find more areas of opportunity and also more areas of savings to support potentially those investments."

So a very good question. And I'll tell you what, I think that there's a fundamental change that -- or we need to do a fundamental change in the company, from a company that was much more focused on today and probably pursuing a strategy that was more focused on inorganic growth to a company that needs to pursue organic growth and needs to understand the future better than anybody else. That's a big change. You need to change, you need to put first the mindset in a direction.
Second, really a strategy. Where do we think that the growth is going to happen? So we need to transform this company into a much more consumer-driven company in a much more looking-forward type of company rather than just operating the present. It's not either one or the other, we need to do both. And I think that we can and we should do both. So as a consequence, I think that the innovation was we did a lot of plan extensions. We were relying too much on things that were not really incremental and we need to do more things in areas that we believe are going to grow. The last call, I gave the example of Boca, and I think is a good example. We were the first company introducing veggie burgers 15 years ago. But because we didn't have a good vision about how the world would progress, Boca has not been a focused brand. And as a consequence, we never really took advantage of everything that is happening in this area. So understanding the future, understanding the consumer, I think, is the way to go. Of course that -- for that, we will need much more -- better insight, much better creativity. We'll need a more united R&D. So we didn't have a Head of R&D. R&D was in all departments of the company. We are now unifying R&D in the company, having one head of R&D. We are defining our strategy. We also appointed a Chief Growth Officer. Pull things into this direction, right. Hopefully, I was -- I gave you the answer you were expecting, John. I don't know if you want to ask anything else related to that."

In my previous company, I worked for 22 years and I learned to love ZBB. But for one reason, because ZBB was a big lever or made it possible to grow the business throughout the year. So when I look at ZBB, I look at it as a discipline to make things every day better, so we can free up resources to invest in other products. I don't look at ZBB as a way to basically cut costs and cut costs. I see it as a way to do things better every day and have -- the consequence of that is to be more efficient and to free up resources to invest in the business.
But addressing your second point about how are you going to invest in things that today are small, and tomorrow can be big, are you going to have that discipline? I think that question is very, very important. I think companies tend to invest only in what's big and not to what it will grow, and I think we need to do both. And then we really need to understand what will grow and bet on it. It may be smaller today, but you need to have the patience to nurture these categories, these products, these brands to be big one day. I'm looking at this right now, and not only brands but also channels that today may not be so representative, but have a great potential for the future. So I tend to agree with you, and I don't think that, that has to do with ZBB. It's just the opposite. I think that ZBB will free up resources to invest in these categories."

So let me -- again, I'm going to -- I'm not going to comment on the consensus expectations for other income. But at the level of our other income, it was very similar to the levels that we had in prior year, pretty much the same type of level. Versus our expectations, it was a little bit better and pretty much driven by 3 factors. It's the first one, we had better return to the capital markets from our investments. We had some gains in hedging positions and also favorable FX in the balance. So this is pretty much how we -- how this other income line performed versus our internal expectations. So for Q4, to give a little bit more color here, we're expecting the other income to go down by around $20 million. It's part of the -- versus -- go down $10 million versus prior year. That's part of the headwind that we disclosed below the EBITDA lines. About divestitures, Miguel, would you want to comment?"

No, I wanted to tell you about baby food, that I think that it's -- we have a business that if you look at -- in baby food, if you look it individually at the countries where we have baby food, it's not very meaningful. We have baby food in a lot of countries: in Russia, in China, in Australia, in Italy, in U.K., in New Zealand, in Canada, in Colombia, in Mexico, all tiny business. Maybe the biggest one is in Italy. But all very tiny business. But when you put them together, it's $0.5 billion business, it's sizable. We are declining in the majority of these countries. And I tell you, I think that is basically because it's not very important in each one of the countries and also because we really do not have expertise, really expertise, big expertise on baby food. And if you look at the countries individually, we don't even have the scale, I think, to have this expertise. Now with the changes that we made in structure, with the appointment of Rafael as our Zone President International when we put Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe together, then he will have all this business or basically all this business together and becomes meaningful in his portfolio. He will put a team working on baby food. Understanding what moves baby food, understanding these sites, understanding the trends, understanding the needs of the moms and the babies that, because of scale, we didn't have today in each one of these countries. So it's a good example of capabilities that we have to build that by changing structure, we can get there. So that would be my comment about baby food."
