Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
As I do each quarter, today I'm going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: Number 1 is organic growth; number 2 is growing through mergers and acquisitions; number 3 is improving our productivity and quality and number 4 is maintaining our unique culture. The team once again executed on all 4 resulting in another great quarter and a fantastic year.
Let me start with some financial highlights for the quarter. Our core Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined to deliver 11% growth in revenue. 5.8% all-in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 45 basis points and we completed 19 tuck-in mergers during the quarter representing about $90 million of annualized revenue. And let's not forget about clean energy. $22 million of after-tax earnings in the quarter bringing the full year total to almost $119 million. Just a great performance by the team.
Now for some more detail on our results starting with the Brokerage segment organic. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.6% all in. Reflecting strong base commission and fee growth of 5.9%. Combined, supplemental and contingent mission growth was 1.7% light by about $2.5 million in the quarter mostly related to catastrophe loss experience. This shortfall didn't move the organic needle much but it did pull our Brokerage margin expansion down from 65 to 70 basis points to 46 basis points. Regardless, a really strong result by the Brokerage team in the face of a tough comparison from last year's fourth quarter.
Let me break down our fourth quarter organic growth around the world. First, our domestic property-casualty operations had a really great quarter with base organic of over 6%. Our domestic retail benefits operations was closer to 2%, which is good performance given that the unit was up against a tough comparable nearly 8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted 8% organic, Canada was up 6% and Australia and New Zealand grew around 9%. Property casualty rates and exposure combined are trending higher across all major geographies and continue to be a modest tailwind to our organic growth. Similar to last quarter, these 2 factors add a little over a point to organic.
Let me give you some rate during the quarter focusing on a few noteworthy lines of business. In our Retail PC business, Commercial Auto and Property lines are both -- are up about 5% and Workers Compensation is down a little less than a point. In our domestic wholesale operations, Property and Commercial Auto lines are up 4%, Casualty lines up 3% and Workers Compensation down over 3%. U.K. retail is flat or modestly positive across almost all lines with the exception of professional liability, which we see up over 5%. In Canada, Property is up more than 4% while Commercial Auto and Casualty lines are up less than 4%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand continue to show the strongest impact. Casualty and Specialty lines are up over 5% and Property is up around 9%. Overall, the PC market remains table similar to past quarters but we do see it trending just a little higher than say we saw in the fall of 2018. Regardless, it's a market that is good for brokers, it's good for carriers and most importantly, it's good for our clients. Looking forward, 2019 Brokerage organic growth feels like it will be around 5%.
Next, let me talk about Brokerage, merger and acquisition growth. 2018 was an outstanding merger and acquisition year. We completed 44 mergers representing about $318 million of annualized revenues. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Looking towards 2019, our merger and acquisition momentum continues. So far this year, we have announced 7 mergers representing about $130 million of annualized revenue. In addition, our internal M&A pipeline report shows around $315 million of revenues associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. Well, not all of these will close. The continued strength in our pipeline shows our ability to attract tuck-in merger partners at fair prices who are excited about our capabilities and believe in our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Moving to productivity and quality. As I mentioned earlier, lower contingent commissions tempered Brokerage margin expansion by about 20 basis points in the quarter. But even with the shortfall in contingents, adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 46 basis points in the quarter, a really nice result. The Brokerage team continues to work hard to find efficiencies across the organization and further leverage our scale helping us become better, faster and deliver higher-quality service to our clients.
Next let me move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was a really strong 6.7%, domestic organic was 6% and international posted 11%. In the U.S., workers' compensation and general liability claim counts are moving higher and finished the year up around 3%. Our insurance carrier business once again grew nicely during the quarter as more and more insurance carriers realized that we can customize and handle claims more efficiently.
Outside the U.S., growth was excellent in Australia and the U.K, which reflects our ability to deliver superior claim outcomes for our clients anywhere around the globe. As we look forward, 2019 Risk Management segment organic growth feels like it will be in the 6% to 7% range.
Moving to mergers and acquisition. Gallagher Bassett completed 2 mergers in the quarter, an Australian-based provider of worker Risk Management services and a U.K.-based provider of Property repair services. These are 2 excellent examples of the type of specialized partners we are attracting in Gallagher Bassett.
In terms of margin, the Risk Management segment fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was increased by 17 basis points. This brought our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin to 17.4% within our 17% to 17.5% expectation. Looking forward, we see margins in the similar range next year as the team leverages its scale through shared services, increases its utilization of our offshore and domestic service centers and invest in technology and analytics.
And finally, I'll touch on what truly distinguishes our franchise and that's our culture. It is a culture that values teamwork, ethics, client service and a dedication to the communities we operate in. The core tenants of our culture, which have been part of this company for generations are moralized in the Gallagher way penned by my uncle in 1984. Everyday, our colleagues get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. This culture that is also been recognized externally. This past year, we were the only insurance broker to be recognized by Forbes Magazine as the World's Best Employer and for 7 straight years, we have been named The World's Most Ethical Company by The Ethisphere Institute.
Awards and recognitions aren't everything. But I believe this continue to show that even as we grow and become more global, our unique Gallagher culture resonates with all of our offices. Okay, an excellent quarter and a tremendous year in all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

Today, I'll highlight a couple of things in the earnings release and then move to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our website. But first, as Pat said, a great quarter to wrap up a fantastic year deserves special mention. I'd like to thank all of our worldwide professionals for such a strong finish. Okay, to the earnings release.
Pat hit the highlights of the Brokerage and Risk Management segments so let's turn to Page 9 to the Corporate segment shortcut table. It's a little noisy so let me break that down. First, you'll see that we had a terrific quarter for clean energy. Due to favorable December weather conditions, our clean energy earnings came through and posted an additional $3 million of after-tax net earnings than we had forecasted during our December 11 Investor Day. That completely offset the slight shortfall in contingents that Pat mentioned earlier. In effect, a nice weather hedge for our total Corporate earnings. I know it isn't technically a hedge but it certainly worked that way this quarter.
Second, you'll see that we have 2 favorable items that we have adjusted out. So looking at the last line in the fourth quarter table, that's at the top of Page 9, that's the adjusted line. You'll see that our Corporate segment came in about $5 million better than the midpoint estimates we provided during our December IR day. The first adjustment is a favorable impact of reorganizing our legal entity structure. A $22 million benefit from releasing the tax valuation allowance. It's not really a cash item this quarter but it does help reduce our ongoing administrative cost and it will reduce cash taxes paid over the next 10 years. Equates to a couple million dollars a year of cash savings going forward.
The second adjustment is an $8.9 million favorable impact from clarifying guidance issued last month related to the Tax Reform Act passed in December 2017. It clarifies how U.S. taxes -- how the U.S. taxes earnings of a foreign subsidiaries. I'll come back to the other Corporate segment line items in a few minutes when we get to the CFO Commentary.
Next, flip to Page 10 of the earnings release. The third item for the bottom called Other. We did sell a small Brokerage unit in January. We thought the product and customer service offerings fit better with the buyers underwriting business so it ended up being a nice win-win for both of us.
Let's go now to the CFO Commentary document. To Page 2. We've now provided our first look at items for 2019. 2 modeling notes: First, amortization expense. Please take a quick look at your Brokerage segment amortization deck. We're forecasting $74 million in the first quarter and at the footnote set, you'll need to tick that up a couple million a quarter for M&A that we can do for the rest of the year and now get your close.
Second, the earnings from noncontrolling interest line. Our first quarter is when our Brokerage segment have the largest impact from earnings from noncontrolling interest. Please double check your models as this has caused some modeling noise in the past.
Let's now turn to Page 3 to the Corporate segment. Let me walk you through that page. First, the blue section is just a reprint of the Corporate shortcut tables from our earnings release this year. Next, we've added the yellow adjusted section to remove the favorable tax items I discussed with you a minute or so ago. We believe the yellow adjusted numbers are more helpful when comparing to both the gray section and that's just a reprint of our estimates given last month during our December IR day and in comparison to the pinkish section, which is our first estimates for 2019.
Let me take each line in that table. Interest and banking. Our fourth quarter came in better than our December estimates, call it a million dollars after-tax. Stronger cash flows in the fourth quarter kept us out of our line of credit. Our borrowings are a little bit lower. As for 2019, again in the pink columns, you'll see that our estimates for interest expense are going up to reflect our additional $600 million of borrowings as noted in Footnote 1 on that page and also in the 8-K we filed with our earnings release this afternoon. We used all of that for M&A, which I'll touch on later in my comments.
Moving down to the M&A expense line. M&A expenses ran a little hot in the fourth quarter coming in at about $4 million more than our estimates. It's simply more external legal and due diligence costs related to 2 international deals that we've recently announced and 1 larger domestic deal that we pulled the plug on in December.
Looking forward, we see 2019 more like the first 3 quarters of 2018 than we do the fourth quarter of '18. The Corporate line, adjusted fourth quarter came in at about $3 million better than our December IR day forecast. Looking forward, we can see 2019 being more consistent with adjusted 2018.
So let's go next to the impact of tax reform line. While the guidance gave us a benefit in 2018, unfortunately, other guidance takes away a different benefit in 2019. So you'll see that 2019 is more in line with the adjusted amounts in the yellow column. But again, it's very important to remind you that this line is mostly a book expense not cash because the additional taxes are nearly all offset by the use of our credits. In the end, tax reform has been a homerun for Gallagher.
Finally, the clean energy. As I mentioned earlier, fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than we forecasted due to our cold last half of December. When you look at our full year 2018, we estimate that ideal weather patterns contributed about $8 million to our full year net earnings of $119 million. So now, as we and our utility partners look out over 2019, we're not expecting increased production levels from another ideal weather year. Rather something closer to production levels we saw back in 2017. It's fantastic that we're still forecasting another year of over $100 million in net earnings but we just don't see it as being amazing as it was in 2018.
Okay, let's flip to Page 5 of the CFO Commentary. You'll see that we've updated our roll-in revenue estimates for mergers that we have announced thus far this year. Here's where our first quarter is a little slow but it's certainly not the case this year. For full year 2019, let's say we can do about $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of M&A with free cash and debt. That consists of $300 million of cash on hand, will generate another $700 million after our dividend here in 2019 plus another $600 million borrowing that I mentioned earlier. Of that, we will use about $500 million for mergers we have already announced and have included in our roll-in revenues in the table meaning that we still have about $1 billion to fund additional M&A in 2019.
In 2018, our weighted average multiple was around 8.3x and it equates to much lower than 8x when you factor in our tax credits showing that we can execute our tuck-in merger strategy at fair pricing, which gives us a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple.
Okay, those are my comments. An excellent quarter to close out an understanding year and we're in a really terrific position to continue our success here in 2019. Back to you, Pat."

That's really what it comes down to. Every one of these, you're fighting to win just like it was an account.

I'm not going to change your systems. I just want you to send me the check every quarter and make sure you make as much of a margin as you can. That's not going to be someone's who's going to benefit Gallagher. So that's what we're doing everyday is trying to figure out, who is going to fit.

Because there the connection to their people and the people that are excited about joining us because they are going to get capabilities and they are at a place that is stable and that is not for sale so are the ones that fit. So yes there's plenty of products out there. This is an incredible business. There's -- the baby boomers are looking at monetizing their life's work and we're not just buying baby boomers and there are literally thousands of these agents and brokers that aren't even over $20 million in revenue. There's thousands of them. And so we offer it, I think a very, very stable home.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
As I do each quarter, today I'm going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: number one is organic growth, number two is growing through mergers and acquisitions, number three is improving our productivity and quality and number 4 is maintaining our unique culture. The team once again executed on all 4, resulting in another great quarter and a fantastic year.
Let me start with some financial highlights for the quarter. Our core Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined to deliver 11% growth in revenue, 5.8% all-in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 45 basis points and we completed 19 tuck-in mergers during the quarter, representing about $90 million of annualized revenue. And let's not forget about clean energy, $22 million of after-tax earnings in the quarter, bringing the full year total to almost $119 million. Just a great performance by the team.
Now for some more detail on our results, starting with the Brokerage segment, organic. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.6% all in, reflecting strong base commission and fee growth of 5.9%. Combined, supplemental and contingent commission growth was 1.7%, light by about $2.5 million in the quarter mostly related to catastrophe loss experience. This shortfall didn't move the organic needle much, but it did pull our Brokerage margin expansion down from 65 to 70 basis points to 46 basis points. Regardless, a really strong result by the Brokerage team in the face of a tough comparison from last year's fourth quarter.
Let me break down our fourth quarter organic growth around the world. First, our domestic property/casualty operations had a really great quarter with base organic of over 6%. Our domestic retail benefits operation was closer to 2%, which is good performance, given that the unit was up against the tough comparable of nearly 8% in the fourth quarter 2017. Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted 8% organic, Canada was up 6% and Australia and New Zealand grew around 9%. Property casualty rates and exposure combined are trending higher across all major geographies and continued to be a modest tailwind to our organic growth. Similar to last quarter, these 2 factors add a little over a point to organic.
Let me give you some rate sound bites during the quarter, focusing on a few noteworthy lines of business. In our retail PC business, commercial auto and property lines are up about 5%, and workers' compensation is down a little less than a point. In our domestic wholesale operations, property and commercial auto lines are up 4%; casualty lines, up 3%; and workers' compensation, down over 3%. U.K. retail is flat or modestly positive across almost all lines with the exception of professional liability, which we see up over 5%. In Canada, property is up more than 4% while commercial auto and casualty lines are up less than 4%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand continue to show the strongest impact. Casualty and specialty lines are up over 5%, and property is up around 9%. Overall, the PC market remains stable, similar to past quarters, but we do see it trending just a little higher than, say, we saw in the fall of 2018. Regardless, it's a market that is good for brokers, it's good for carriers and, most importantly, it's good for our clients. Looking forward, 2019 Brokerage organic growth feels like it will be around 5%.
Next, let me talk about Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. 2018 was an outstanding merger and acquisition year. We completed 44 mergers, representing about $318 million of annualized revenues. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Looking toward 2019, our merger and acquisition momentum continues. So far this year, we have announced 7 mergers, representing about $130 million of annualized revenue. In addition, our internal M&A pipeline report shows around $350 million of revenues associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. While not all of these will close, the continued strength in our pipeline shows our ability to attract tuck-in merger partners at fair prices who are excited about our capabilities and believe in our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Moving to productivity and quality. As I mentioned earlier, lower contingent commissions tempered Brokerage margin expansion by about 20 basis points in the quarter. But even with the shortfall in contingents, adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 46 basis points in the quarter, a really nice result. The Brokerage team continues to work hard to find efficiencies across the organization and further leverage our scale, helping us become better, faster and deliver higher-quality service to our clients.
Next let me move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was a really strong 6.7%, domestic organic was 6% and international posted 11%. In the U.S., workers' compensation and general liability claim counts are moving higher and finished the year up around 3%. Our insurance carrier business once again grew nicely during the quarter as more and more insurance carriers realize that we can customize and handle claims more efficiently.
Outside the U.S., growth was excellent in Australia and the U.K., which reflects our ability to deliver superior claim outcomes for our clients anywhere around the globe. As we look forward, 2019 Risk Management segment organic growth feels like it will be in the 6% to 7% range.
Moving to mergers and acquisitions. Gallagher Bassett completed 2 mergers in the quarter, an Australian-based provider of worker risk management services and a U.K.-based provider of property repair services. These are 2 excellent examples of the type of specialized partners we're attracting to Gallagher Bassett.
In terms of margin, the Risk Management segment fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was -- it increased by 17 basis points. This brought our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin to 17.4%, within our 17% to 17.5% expectation. Looking forward, we see margins in the similar range next year as the team leverages its scale through shared services, increases its utilization of our offshore and domestic service centers and invest in technology and analytics.
And finally, I'll touch on what truly distinguishes our franchise, and that's our culture. It is a culture that values teamwork, ethics, client service and a dedication to the communities we operate in. The core tenets of our culture, which have been part of this company for generations, are memorialized in the Gallagher way, penned by my uncle in 1984. Every day, our colleagues get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. It is a culture that has also been recognized externally. This past year, we were the only insurance broker to be recognized by Forbes Magazine as the World's Best Employer. And for 7 straight years, we have been named The World's Most Ethical Company by The Ethisphere Institute. Awards and recognitions aren't everything. But I believe these continue to show that even as we grow and become more global, our unique Gallagher culture resonates with all of our offices.
Okay, an excellent quarter and a tremendous year in all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

That completely offset the slight shortfall in contingents that Pat mentioned earlier, in effect, a nice weather hedge for our total Corporate earnings. I know it isn't technically a hedge, but it certainly worked that way this quarter.
Second, you'll see that we had 2 favorable items that we have adjusted out. So looking at the last line, in the fourth quarter table that's at the top of Page 9, that's the adjusted line, you'll see that our Corporate segment came in about $5 million better than the midpoint estimates we provided during our December IR Day. The first adjustment is the favorable impact of reorganizing our legal entity structure, a $22 million benefit from releasing the tax valuation allowance. It's not really a cash item this quarter, but it does help reduce our ongoing administrative cost. And it will reduce cash taxes paid over the next 10 years, equates to a couple million dollars a year of cash savings going forward.
The second adjustment is an $8.9 million favorable impact from clarifying guidance issued last month related to the Tax Reform Act passed in December 2017. It clarifies how U.S. taxes -- how the U.S. taxes earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. I'll come back to the other Corporate segment line items in a few minutes when we get to the CFO Commentary.
Next, flip to Page 10 of the earnings release, the third item from the bottom called other. We did sell a small brokerage unit in January. We thought the product and customer service offering fit better with the buyer's underwriting business, so it ended up being a nice win-win for both of us.
Let's go now to the CFO Commentary document, to Page 2. We've now provided our first look at items for 2019. Two modeling notes: first, amortization expense. Please take a quick look at your Brokerage segment amortization packs. We're forecasting $74 million in the first quarter. And as the footnote says, you'll need to tick that up a couple million a quarter for M&A that we could do for the rest of the year, and that will get you close.
Second, the earnings from noncontrolling interest line. Our first quarter is when our Brokerage segment has the largest impact from earnings from noncontrolling interest. Please double check your models as this has caused some modeling noise in the past.
Let's now turn to Page 3, to the Corporate segment. Let me walk you through that page. First, the blue section is just a reprint of the Corporate shortcut tables from our earnings release this year. Next, we've added the yellow adjusted section to remove the favorable tax items I discussed with you a minute or so ago. We believe the yellow adjusted numbers are more helpful when comparing to both the gray section, and that's just a reprint of our estimates given last month during our December IR day, and in comparison to the pinkish section, which is our first estimates for 2019.
Let me take each line in that table. Interest and banking. Our fourth quarter came in better than our December estimates, call it, a million dollars after-tax. Stronger cash flows in the fourth quarter kept us out of our line of credit. Our borrowings are a little bit lower. As for 2019, again in the pink column, you'll see that our estimates for interest expense are going up to reflect our additional $600 million of borrowings, as noted in Footnote 1 on that page and also in the 8-K we filed with our earnings release this afternoon. We'll use all of that for M&A, which I'll touch on later in my comments.
Moving down to the M&A expense line. M&A expenses ran a little hot in the fourth quarter, coming in about $4 million more than our estimates. It's simply more external legal and due diligence costs related to 2 international deals that we've recently announced and 1 larger domestic deal that we pulled the plug on in December.
Looking forward, we see 2019 more like the first 3 quarters of 2018 than we do the fourth quarter of '18. The Corporate line, adjusted fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than our December IR Day forecast. Looking forward, we again see 2019 being more consistent with adjusted 2018.
So let's go next to the impact of tax reform line. While the guidance gave us a benefit in 2018, unfortunately, other guidance takes away a different benefit in 2019. So you'll see that 2019 is more in line with the adjusted amounts in the yellow column. But again, it's very important to remind you that this line is mostly a book expense, not cash, because the additional taxes are nearly all offset by the use of our credits. In the end, tax reform has been a home run for Gallagher.
Finally, to clean energy. As I mentioned earlier, fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than we forecasted due to a cold last half of December. When you look at our full year 2018, we estimate that ideal weather patterns contributed about $8 million to our full year net earnings of $119 million. So now as we and our utility partners look out over 2019, we're not expecting increased production levels from another ideal weather year, rather, something closer to production levels we saw back in 2017. It's fantastic that we're still forecasting another year of over $100 million in net earnings, but we just don't see it as being amazing as it was in 2018.
Okay, let's flip to Page 5 of the CFO Commentary. You'll see that we've updated our roll-in revenue estimates for mergers that we have announced thus far this year. Here's why our first quarter was a little slow, but it's certainly not the case this year. For full year 2019, let's say we can do about $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of M&A with free cash and debt. That consists of $300 million of cash on hand, will generate another $700 million after our dividend here in 2019 plus another $600 million borrowing that I mentioned earlier. Of that, we use or will use about $500 million for mergers we have already announced and have included in our roll-in revenues in the table, meaning that we still have about $1 billion to fund additional M&A in 2019.
In 2018, our weighted average multiple was around 8.3x, and it equates to much lower than 8x when you factor in our tax credits, showing that we can execute our tuck-in merger strategy at fair pricing, which gives us a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple.
Okay, those are my comments. An excellent quarter to close out an understanding year, and we're in a really terrific position to continue our success here in 2019.
Back to you, Pat."

We don't really cut back on those things that are building our franchise going forward. But rather, what we'll do is we'll be just a little bit slower to hire. And when you're having 10% of your workforce turn over every year, you can tighten your belt a little bit and reallocate work. And that tends to be what you can do in a recession.

And that's really what it comes down to. Every one of these, you're fighting to win just like it was an account. And you're going to fight that battle on a bunch of themes, and one of those themes is culture. And if, in fact, what you want to do is sell to someone that says, ""I'm not going to change anything about you. I'm not going to change your name. I'm not going to change your marketing. I'm not going to change your systems. I just want you to send me the check every quarter and make sure you make as much of a margin as you can,"" that's not going to be someone's who's going to fit Gallagher. And so that's what we're doing every day, is trying to figure out who is going to fit. And then the second thing that I think we're pretty good at that is really important, is the entrepreneur going to stay? Because they're the connection to their people, and the people that are excited about joining us, because they are going to get capabilities and they are at a place that is stable and is not for sale, are the ones that fit. So yes, there's plenty of product out there. This is an incredible business. There's -- the baby boomers are looking at monetizing their life's work, and we're not just out buying baby boomers. And there are literally thousands of these agents and brokers that aren't even over $20 million of revenue. There's thousands of them. And so we offer, I think, a very, very stable home. I'm proud to be able to say to these people, as they come through my office, any account of any size located anywhere in the world, we can do it. Isn't that cool if you're a little broker from, let's say, Cincinnati?"

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
As I do each quarter, today I'm going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: number one is organic growth, number two is growing through mergers and acquisitions, number three is improving our productivity and quality and number 4 is maintaining our unique culture. The team once again executed on all 4, resulting in another great quarter and a fantastic year.
Let me start with some financial highlights for the quarter. Our core Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined to deliver 11% growth in revenue, 5.8% all-in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 45 basis points and we completed 19 tuck-in mergers during the quarter, representing about $90 million of annualized revenue. And let's not forget about clean energy, $22 million of after-tax earnings in the quarter, bringing the full year total to almost $119 million. Just a great performance by the team.
Now for some more detail on our results, starting with the Brokerage segment, organic. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.6% all in, reflecting strong base commission and fee growth of 5.9%. Combined, supplemental and contingent commission growth was 1.7%, light by about $2.5 million in the quarter, mostly related to catastrophe loss experience. This shortfall didn't move the organic needle much, but it did pull our Brokerage margin expansion down from 65 to 70 basis points to 46 basis points. Regardless, a really strong result by the Brokerage team in the face of a tough comparison from last year's fourth quarter.
Let me break down our fourth quarter organic growth around the world. First, our domestic property/casualty operations had a really great quarter with base organic of over 6%. Our domestic retail benefits operation was closer to 2%, which is good performance, given that the unit was up against the tough comparable of nearly 8% in the fourth quarter 2017. Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted 8% organic, Canada was up 6% and Australia and New Zealand grew around 9%. Property/casualty rates and exposure combined are trending higher across all major geographies and continued to be a modest tailwind to our organic growth. Similar to last quarter, these 2 factors added a little over a point to organic.
Let me give you some rate sound bites during the quarter, focusing on a few noteworthy lines of business. In our retail PC business, commercial auto and property lines are up about 5%, and workers' compensation is down a little less than a point. In our domestic wholesale operations, property and commercial auto lines are up 4%; casualty lines, up 3%; and workers' compensation, down over 3%. U.K. retail is flat or modestly positive across almost all lines with the exception of professional liability, which we see up over 5%. In Canada, property is up more than 4% while commercial auto and casualty lines are up less than 4%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand continue to show the strongest impact. Casualty and specialty lines are up over 5%, and property is up around 9%. Overall, the PC market remains stable, similar to past quarters, but we do see it trending just a little higher than, say, we saw in the fall of 2018. Regardless, it's a market that is good for brokers, it's good for carriers and, most importantly, it's good for our clients. Looking forward, 2019 Brokerage organic growth feels like it will be around 5%.
Next, let me talk about Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. 2018 was an outstanding merger and acquisition year. We completed 44 mergers, representing about $318 million of annualized revenues. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Looking toward 2019, our merger and acquisition momentum continues. So far this year, we have announced 7 mergers, representing about $130 million of annualized revenue. In addition, our internal M&A pipeline report shows around $350 million of revenues associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. While not all of these will close, the continued strength in our pipeline shows our ability to attract tuck-in merger partners at fair prices, who are excited about our capabilities and believe in our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Moving to productivity and quality. As I mentioned earlier, lower contingent commissions tempered Brokerage margin expansion by about 20 basis points in the quarter. But even with the shortfall in contingents, adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 46 basis points in the quarter, a really nice result. The Brokerage team continues to work hard to find efficiencies across the organization and further leverage our scale, helping us become better, faster and deliver higher-quality service to our clients.
Next let me move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was a really strong 6.7%, domestic organic was 6% and international posted 11%. In the U.S., workers' compensation and general liability claim counts are moving higher and finished the year up around 3%. Our insurance carrier business once again grew nicely during the quarter as more and more insurance carriers realize that we can customize and handle claims more efficiently.
Outside the U.S., growth was excellent in Australia and the U.K., which reflects our ability to deliver superior claim outcomes for our clients anywhere around the globe. As we look forward, 2019 Risk Management segment organic growth feels like it will be in the 6% to 7% range.
Moving to mergers and acquisitions. Gallagher Bassett completed 2 mergers in the quarter: an Australian-based provider of worker risk management services and a U.K.-based provider of property repair services. These are 2 excellent examples of the type of specialized partners we're attracting to Gallagher Bassett.
In terms of margin, the Risk Management segment fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was -- increased by 17 basis points. This brought our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin to 17.4%, within our 17% to 17.5% expectation. Looking forward, we see margins in a similar range next year as the team leverages its scale through shared services, increases its utilization of our offshore and domestic service centers and invests in technology and analytics.
And finally, I'll touch on what truly distinguishes our franchise, and that's our culture. It is a culture that values teamwork, ethics, client service and a dedication to the communities we operate in. The core tenets of our culture, which have been part of this company for generations, are memorialized in The Gallagher Way, penned by my uncle in 1984. Every day, our colleagues get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. It is a culture that has also been recognized externally. This past year, we were the only insurance broker to be recognized by Forbes Magazine as the World's Best Employer. And for 7 straight years, we have been named The World's Most Ethical Company by The Ethisphere Institute. Awards and recognitions aren't everything. But I believe these continue to show that even as we grow and become more global, our unique Gallagher culture resonates with all of our offices.
Okay, an excellent quarter and a tremendous year on all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

Today, I'll highlight a couple of things in the earnings release and then move to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our website. But first, as Pat said, a great quarter to wrap up a fantastic year deserves special mention. I'd like to thank all of our worldwide professionals for such a strong finish. Okay, to the earnings release.
Pat hit the highlights of the Brokerage and Risk Management segments, so let's turn to Page 9, to the Corporate segment shortcut table. That's a little noisy, so let me break that down. First, you'll see that we had a terrific quarter for clean energy. Due to favorable December weather conditions, our clean energy earnings came through to post an additional $3 million of after-tax net earnings than we had forecasted during our December 11 Investor Day. That completely offset the slight shortfall in contingents that Pat mentioned earlier, in effect, a nice weather hedge for our total Corporate earnings. I know it isn't technically a hedge, but it certainly worked that way this quarter.
Second, you'll see that we had 2 favorable items that we have adjusted out. So looking at the last line in the fourth quarter table that's at the top of Page 9, that's the adjusted line, you'll see that our Corporate segment came in about $5 million better than the midpoint estimates we provided during our December IR Day. The first adjustment is the favorable impact of reorganizing our legal entity structure, a $22 million benefit from releasing the tax valuation allowance. It's not really a cash item this quarter, but it does help reduce our ongoing administrative cost and it will reduce cash taxes paid over the next 10 years. It equates to a couple million dollars a year of cash savings going forward.
The second adjustment is an $8.9 million favorable impact from clarifying guidance issued last month related to the Tax Reform Act passed in December 2017. It clarifies how U.S. taxes -- how the U.S. taxes earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. I'll come back to the other Corporate segment line items in a few minutes when we get to the CFO Commentary.
Next, flip to Page 10 of the earnings release, the third item from the bottom called other. We did sell a small brokerage unit in January. We thought the product and customer service offering fit better with the buyer's underwriting business, so it ended up being a nice win-win for both of us.
Let's go now to the CFO Commentary document, to Page 2. We've now provided our first look at items for 2019. Two modeling notes: first, amortization expense. Please take a quick look at your Brokerage segment amortization picks. We're forecasting $74 million in the first quarter. And as the footnote says, you'll need to tick that up a couple million a quarter for M&A that we could do for the rest of the year, and that will get you close.
Second, the earnings from noncontrolling interest line. Our first quarter is when our Brokerage segment has the largest impact from earnings from noncontrolling interest. Please double check your models as this has caused some modeling noise in the past.
Let's now turn to Page 3, to the Corporate segment. Let me walk you through that page. First, the blue section is just a reprint of the Corporate shortcut tables from our earnings release this year. Next, we've added the yellow adjusted section to remove the favorable tax items I discussed with you a minute or so ago. We believe the yellow adjusted numbers are more helpful when comparing to both the gray section, and that's just a reprint of our estimates given last month during our December IR day, and in comparison to the pinkish section, which is our first estimates for 2019.
Let me take each line in that table. Interest and banking. Our fourth quarter came in better than our December estimates, call it $1 million dollars after-tax. Stronger cash flows in the fourth quarter kept us out of our line of credit. Our borrowings are a little bit lower. As for 2019, again in the pink column, you'll see that our estimates for interest expense are going up to reflect our additional $600 million of borrowings, as noted in Footnote 1 on that page and also in the 8-K we filed with our earnings release this afternoon. We'll use all of that for M&A, which I'll touch on later in my comments.
Moving down to the M&A expense line. M&A expenses ran a little hot in the fourth quarter, coming in about $4 million more than our estimates. It's simply more external legal and due diligence costs related to 2 international deals that we've recently announced and 1 larger domestic deal that we pulled the plug on in December.
Looking forward, we see 2019 more like the first 3 quarters of 2018 than we do the fourth quarter of '18. The Corporate line, adjusted fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than our December IR Day forecast. Looking forward, we again see 2019 being more consistent with adjusted 2018.
So let's go next to the impact of tax reform line. While the guidance gave us a benefit in 2018, unfortunately, other guidance takes away a different benefit in 2019. So you'll see that 2019 is more in line with the adjusted amounts in the yellow column. But again, it's very important to remind you that this line is mostly a book expense, not cash, because the additional taxes are nearly all offset by the use of our credits. In the end, tax reform has been a home run for Gallagher.
Finally, to clean energy. As I mentioned earlier, fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than we forecasted due to a cold last half of December. When you look at our full year 2018, we estimate that ideal weather patterns contributed about $8 million to our full year net earnings of $119 million. So now as we and our utility partners look out over 2019, we're not expecting increased production levels from another ideal weather year, rather, something closer to production levels we saw back in 2017. It's fantastic that we're still forecasting another year of over $100 million in net earnings, but we just don't see it as being amazing as it was in 2018.
Okay, let's flip to Page 5 of the CFO Commentary. You'll see that we've updated our roll-in revenue estimates for mergers that we have announced thus far this year. Here's why our first quarter was a little slow, but it's certainly not the case this year. For full year 2019, looks like we can do about $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of M&A with free cash and debt. That consists of $300 million of cash on hand, we'll generate another $700 million after our dividend here in 2019, plus another $600 million borrowing that I mentioned earlier. Of that, we use or will use about $500 million for mergers we have already announced and have included in our roll-in revenues in the table, meaning that we still have about $1 billion to fund additional M&A in 2019.
In 2018, our weighted average multiple was around 8.3x, and it equates to much lower than 8x when you factor in our tax credits, showing that we can execute our tuck-in merger strategy at fair pricing, which gives us a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple.
Okay, those are my comments. An excellent quarter to close out an outstanding year, and we're in a really terrific position to continue our success here in 2019.
Back to you, Pat."

And that's really what it comes down to. Every one of these, you're fighting to win just like it was an account. And you're going to fight that battle on a bunch of themes, and one of those themes is culture. And if, in fact, what you want to do is sell to someone that says, ""I'm not going to change anything about you. I'm not going to change your name. I'm not going to change your marketing. I'm not going to change your systems. I just want you to send me the check every quarter and make sure you make as much of a margin as you can,"" that's not going to be somebody who's going to fit Gallagher. And so that's what we're doing every day, is trying to figure out who is going to fit. And then the second thing that I think we're pretty good at that is really important, is the entrepreneur going to stay? Because they're the connection to their people, and the people that are excited about joining us, because they are going to get capabilities and they are at a place that is stable and is not for sale, are the ones that fit. So yes, there's plenty of product out there. This is an incredible business. There's -- the baby boomers are looking at monetizing their life's work, and we're not just out buying baby boomers. And there are literally thousands of these agents and brokers that aren't even over $20 million of revenue. There's thousands of them. And so we offer, I think, a very, very stable home. I'm proud to be able to say to these people, as they come through my office, any account of any size located anywhere in the world, we can do it. Isn't that cool if you're a little broker from, let's say, Cincinnati?"

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
As I do each quarter, today I'm going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: number one is organic growth, number two is growing through mergers and acquisitions, number three is improving our productivity and quality and number 4 is maintaining our unique culture. The team once again executed on all 4, resulting in another great quarter and a fantastic year.
Let me start with some financial highlights for the quarter. Our core Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined to deliver 11% growth in revenue, 5.8% all-in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 45 basis points and we completed 19 tuck-in mergers during the quarter, representing about $90 million of annualized revenue. And let's not forget about clean energy, $22 million of after-tax earnings in the quarter, bringing the full year total to almost $119 million. Just a great performance by the team.
Now for some more detail on our results, starting with the Brokerage segment, organic. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.6% all in, reflecting strong base commission and fee growth of 5.9%. Combined, supplemental and contingent commission growth was 1.7%, light by about $2.5 million in the quarter, mostly related to catastrophe loss experience. This shortfall didn't move the organic needle much, but it did pull our Brokerage margin expansion down from 65 to 70 basis points to 46 basis points. Regardless, a really strong result by the Brokerage team in the face of a tough comparison from last year's fourth quarter.
Let me break down our fourth quarter organic growth around the world. First, our domestic property/casualty operations had a really great quarter with base organic of over 6%. Our domestic retail benefits operation was closer to 2%, which is good performance, given that the unit was up against the tough comparable of nearly 8% in the fourth quarter 2017. Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted 8% organic, Canada was up 6% and Australia and New Zealand grew around 9%. Property/casualty rates and exposure combined are trending higher across all major geographies and continued to be a modest tailwind to our organic growth. Similar to last quarter, these 2 factors added a little over a point to organic.
Let me give you some rate sound bites during the quarter, focusing on a few noteworthy lines of business. In our retail PC business, commercial auto and property lines are up about 5%, and workers' compensation is down a little less than a point. In our domestic wholesale operations, property and commercial auto lines are up 4%; casualty lines, up 3%; and workers' compensation, down over 3%. U.K. retail is flat or modestly positive across almost all lines with the exception of professional liability, which we see up over 5%. In Canada, property is up more than 4% while commercial auto and casualty lines are up less than 4%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand continue to show the strongest impact. Casualty and specialty lines are up over 5%, and property is up around 9%. Overall, the PC market remains stable, similar to past quarters, but we do see it trending just a little higher than, say, we saw in the fall of 2018. Regardless, it's a market that is good for brokers, it's good for carriers and, most importantly, it's good for our clients. Looking forward, 2019 Brokerage organic growth feels like it will be around 5%.
Next, let me talk about Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. 2018 was an outstanding merger and acquisition year. We completed 44 mergers, representing about $318 million of annualized revenues. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Looking toward 2019, our merger and acquisition momentum continues. So far this year, we have announced 7 mergers, representing about $130 million of annualized revenue. In addition, our internal M&A pipeline report shows around $350 million of revenues associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. While not all of these will close, the continued strength in our pipeline shows our ability to attract tuck-in merger partners at fair prices, who are excited about our capabilities and believe in our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Moving to productivity and quality. As I mentioned earlier, lower contingent commissions tempered Brokerage margin expansion by about 20 basis points in the quarter. But even with the shortfall in contingents, adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 46 basis points in the quarter, a really nice result. The Brokerage team continues to work hard to find efficiencies across the organization and further leverage our scale, helping us become better, faster and deliver higher-quality service to our clients.
Next let me move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was a really strong 6.7%, domestic organic was 6% and international posted 11%. In the U.S., workers' compensation and general liability claim counts are moving higher and finished the year up around 3%. Our insurance carrier business once again grew nicely during the quarter as more and more insurance carriers realize that we can customize and handle claims more efficiently.
Outside the U.S., growth was excellent in Australia and the U.K., which reflects our ability to deliver superior claim outcomes for our clients anywhere around the globe. As we look forward, 2019 Risk Management segment organic growth feels like it will be in the 6% to 7% range.
Moving to mergers and acquisitions. Gallagher Bassett completed 2 mergers in the quarter: an Australian-based provider of worker risk management services and a U.K.-based provider of property repair services. These are 2 excellent examples of the type of specialized partners we're attracting to Gallagher Bassett.
In terms of margin, the Risk Management segment fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was -- increased by 17 basis points. This brought our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin to 17.4%, within our 17% to 17.5% expectation. Looking forward, we see margins in a similar range next year as the team leverages its scale through shared services, increases its utilization of our offshore and domestic service centers and invests in technology and analytics.
And finally, I'll touch on what truly distinguishes our franchise, and that's our culture. It is a culture that values teamwork, ethics, client service and a dedication to the communities we operate in. The core tenets of our culture, which have been part of this company for generations, are memorialized in The Gallagher Way, penned by my uncle in 1984. Every day, our colleagues get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. It is a culture that has also been recognized externally. This past year, we were the only insurance broker to be recognized by Forbes Magazine as the World's Best Employer. And for 7 straight years, we have been named The World's Most Ethical Company by The Ethisphere Institute. Awards and recognitions aren't everything. But I believe these continue to show that even as we grow and become more global, our unique Gallagher culture resonates with all of our offices.
Okay, an excellent quarter and a tremendous year on all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

Today, I'll highlight a couple of things in the earnings release and then move to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our website. But first, as Pat said, a great quarter to wrap up a fantastic year deserves special mention. I'd like to thank all of our worldwide professionals for such a strong finish. Okay, to the earnings release.
Pat hit the highlights of the Brokerage and Risk Management segments, so let's turn to Page 9, to the Corporate segment shortcut table. That's a little noisy, so let me break that down. First, you'll see that we had a terrific quarter for clean energy. Due to favorable December weather conditions, our clean energy earnings came through to post an additional $3 million of after-tax net earnings than we had forecasted during our December 11 Investor Day. That completely offset the slight shortfall in contingents that Pat mentioned earlier, in effect, a nice weather hedge for our total Corporate earnings. I know it isn't technically a hedge, but it certainly worked that way this quarter.
Second, you'll see that we had 2 favorable items that we have adjusted out. So looking at the last line in the fourth quarter table that's at the top of Page 9, that's the adjusted line, you'll see that our Corporate segment came in about $5 million better than the midpoint estimates we provided during our December IR Day. The first adjustment is the favorable impact of reorganizing our legal entity structure, a $22 million benefit from releasing the tax valuation allowance. It's not really a cash item this quarter, but it does help reduce our ongoing administrative cost and it will reduce cash taxes paid over the next 10 years. It equates to a couple million dollars a year of cash savings going forward.
The second adjustment is an $8.9 million favorable impact from clarifying guidance issued last month related to the Tax Reform Act passed in December 2017. It clarifies how U.S. taxes -- how the U.S. taxes earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. I'll come back to the other Corporate segment line items in a few minutes when we get to the CFO Commentary.
Next, flip to Page 10 of the earnings release, the third item from the bottom called other. We did sell a small brokerage unit in January. We thought the product and customer service offering fit better with the buyer's underwriting business, so it ended up being a nice win-win for both of us.
Let's go now to the CFO Commentary document, to Page 2. We've now provided our first look at items for 2019. Two modeling notes: first, amortization expense. Please take a quick look at your Brokerage segment amortization picks. We're forecasting $74 million in the first quarter. And as the footnote says, you'll need to tick that up a couple million a quarter for M&A that we could do for the rest of the year, and that will get you close.
Second, the earnings from noncontrolling interest line. Our first quarter is when our Brokerage segment has the largest impact from earnings from noncontrolling interest. Please double check your models as this has caused some modeling noise in the past.
Let's now turn to Page 3, to the Corporate segment. Let me walk you through that page. First, the blue section is just a reprint of the Corporate shortcut tables from our earnings release this year. Next, we've added the yellow adjusted section to remove the favorable tax items I discussed with you a minute or so ago. We believe the yellow adjusted numbers are more helpful when comparing to both the gray section, and that's just a reprint of our estimates given last month during our December IR day, and in comparison to the pinkish section, which is our first estimates for 2019.
Let me take each line in that table. Interest and banking. Our fourth quarter came in better than our December estimates, call it $1 million dollars after-tax. Stronger cash flows in the fourth quarter kept us out of our line of credit. Our borrowings are a little bit lower. As for 2019, again in the pink column, you'll see that our estimates for interest expense are going up to reflect our additional $600 million of borrowings, as noted in Footnote 1 on that page and also in the 8-K we filed with our earnings release this afternoon. We'll use all of that for M&A, which I'll touch on later in my comments.
Moving down to the M&A expense line. M&A expenses ran a little hot in the fourth quarter, coming in about $4 million more than our estimates. It's simply more external legal and due diligence costs related to 2 international deals that we've recently announced and 1 larger domestic deal that we pulled the plug on in December.
Looking forward, we see 2019 more like the first 3 quarters of 2018 than we do the fourth quarter of '18. The Corporate line, adjusted fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than our December IR Day forecast. Looking forward, we again see 2019 being more consistent with adjusted 2018.
So let's go next to the impact of tax reform line. While the guidance gave us a benefit in 2018, unfortunately, other guidance takes away a different benefit in 2019. So you'll see that 2019 is more in line with the adjusted amounts in the yellow column. But again, it's very important to remind you that this line is mostly a book expense, not cash, because the additional taxes are nearly all offset by the use of our credits. In the end, tax reform has been a home run for Gallagher.
Finally, to clean energy. As I mentioned earlier, fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than we forecasted due to a cold last half of December. When you look at our full year 2018, we estimate that ideal weather patterns contributed about $8 million to our full year net earnings of $119 million. So now as we and our utility partners look out over 2019, we're not expecting increased production levels from another ideal weather year, rather, something closer to production levels we saw back in 2017. It's fantastic that we're still forecasting another year of over $100 million in net earnings, but we just don't see it as being amazing as it was in 2018.
Okay, let's flip to Page 5 of the CFO Commentary. You'll see that we've updated our roll-in revenue estimates for mergers that we have announced thus far this year. Here's why our first quarter was a little slow, but it's certainly not the case this year. For full year 2019, looks like we can do about $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of M&A with free cash and debt. That consists of $300 million of cash on hand, we'll generate another $700 million after our dividend here in 2019, plus another $600 million borrowing that I mentioned earlier. Of that, we use or will use about $500 million for mergers we have already announced and have included in our roll-in revenues in the table, meaning that we still have about $1 billion to fund additional M&A in 2019.
In 2018, our weighted average multiple was around 8.3x, and it equates to much lower than 8x when you factor in our tax credits, showing that we can execute our tuck-in merger strategy at fair pricing, which gives us a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple.
Okay, those are my comments. An excellent quarter to close out an outstanding year, and we're in a really terrific position to continue our success here in 2019.
Back to you, Pat."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
As I do each quarter, today I'm going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: number one is organic growth, number two is growing through mergers and acquisitions, number three is improving our productivity and quality and number 4 is maintaining our unique culture. The team once again executed on all 4, resulting in another great quarter and a fantastic year.
Let me start with some financial highlights for the quarter. Our core Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined to deliver 11% growth in revenue, 5.8% all-in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 45 basis points and we completed 19 tuck-in mergers during the quarter, representing about $90 million of annualized revenue. And let's not forget about clean energy, $22 million of after-tax earnings in the quarter, bringing the full year total to almost $119 million. Just a great performance by the team.
Now for some more detail on our results, starting with the Brokerage segment, organic. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.6% all in, reflecting strong base commission and fee growth of 5.9%. Combined, supplemental and contingent commission growth was 1.7%, light by about $2.5 million in the quarter, mostly related to catastrophe loss experience. This shortfall didn't move the organic needle much, but it did pull our Brokerage margin expansion down from 65 to 70 basis points to 46 basis points. Regardless, a really strong result by the Brokerage team in the face of a tough comparison from last year's fourth quarter.
Let me break down our fourth quarter organic growth around the world. First, our domestic property/casualty operations had a really great quarter with base organic of over 6%. Our domestic retail benefits operation was closer to 2%, which is good performance, given that the unit was up against the tough comparable of nearly 8% in the fourth quarter 2017. Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted 8% organic, Canada was up 6% and Australia and New Zealand grew around 9%. Property/casualty rates and exposure combined are trending higher across all major geographies and continued to be a modest tailwind to our organic growth. Similar to last quarter, these 2 factors added a little over a point to organic.
Let me give you some rate sound bites during the quarter, focusing on a few noteworthy lines of business. In our retail PC business, commercial auto and property lines are up about 5%, and workers' compensation is down a little less than a point. In our domestic wholesale operations, property and commercial auto lines are up 4%; casualty lines, up 3%; and workers' compensation, down over 3%. U.K. retail is flat or modestly positive across almost all lines with the exception of professional liability, which we see up over 5%. In Canada, property is up more than 4% while commercial auto and casualty lines are up less than 4%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand continue to show the strongest impact. Casualty and specialty lines are up over 5%, and property is up around 9%. Overall, the PC market remains stable, similar to past quarters, but we do see it trending just a little higher than, say, we saw in the fall of 2018. Regardless, it's a market that is good for brokers, it's good for carriers and, most importantly, it's good for our clients. Looking forward, 2019 Brokerage organic growth feels like it will be around 5%.
Next, let me talk about Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. 2018 was an outstanding merger and acquisition year. We completed 44 mergers, representing about $318 million of annualized revenues. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Looking toward 2019, our merger and acquisition momentum continues. So far this year, we have announced 7 mergers, representing about $130 million of annualized revenue. In addition, our internal M&A pipeline report shows around $350 million of revenues associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. While not all of these will close, the continued strength in our pipeline shows our ability to attract tuck-in merger partners at fair prices who are excited about our capabilities and believe in our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Moving to productivity and quality. As I mentioned earlier, lower contingent commissions tempered Brokerage margin expansion by about 20 basis points in the quarter. But even with the shortfall in contingents, adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 46 basis points in the quarter, a really nice result. The Brokerage team continues to work hard to find efficiencies across the organization and further leverage our scale, helping us become better, faster and deliver higher-quality service to our clients.
Next let me move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was a really strong 6.7%, domestic organic was 6% and international posted 11%. In the U.S., workers' compensation and general liability claim counts are moving higher and finished the year up around 3%. Our insurance carrier business once again grew nicely during the quarter as more and more insurance carriers realize that we can customize and handle claims more efficiently.
Outside the U.S., growth was excellent in Australia and the U.K., which reflects our ability to deliver superior claim outcomes for our clients anywhere around the globe. As we look forward, 2019 Risk Management segment organic growth feels like it will be in the 6% to 7% range.
Moving to mergers and acquisitions. Gallagher Bassett completed 2 mergers in the quarter, an Australian-based provider of worker risk management services and a U.K.-based provider of property repair services. These are 2 excellent examples of the type of specialized partners we're attracting to Gallagher Bassett.
In terms of margin, the Risk Management segment fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was -- increased by 17 basis points. This brought our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin to 17.4%, within our 17% to 17.5% expectation. Looking forward, we see margins in a similar range next year as the team leverages its scale through shared services, increases its utilization of our offshore and domestic service centers and invests in technology and analytics.
And finally, I'll touch on what truly distinguishes our franchise, and that's our culture. It is a culture that values teamwork, ethics, client service and a dedication to the communities we operate in. The core tenets of our culture, which have been part of this company for generations, are memorialized in The Gallagher Way, penned by my uncle in 1984. Every day, our colleagues get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. It is a culture that has also been recognized externally. This past year, we were the only insurance broker to be recognized by Forbes Magazine as the World's Best Employer. And for 7 straight years, we have been named The World's Most Ethical Company by The Ethisphere Institute. Awards and recognitions aren't everything. But I believe these continue to show that even as we grow and become more global, our unique Gallagher culture resonates with all of our offices.
Okay, an excellent quarter and a tremendous year on all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

Today, I'll highlight a couple of things in the earnings release and then move to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our website. But first, as Pat said, a great quarter to wrap up a fantastic year deserves special mention. I'd like to thank all of our worldwide professionals for such a strong finish. Okay, to the earnings release.
Pat hit the highlights of the Brokerage and Risk Management segments, so let's turn to Page 9, to the Corporate segment shortcut table. That's a little noisy, so let me break that down. First, you'll see that we had a terrific quarter for clean energy. Due to favorable December weather conditions, our clean energy earnings came through to post an additional $3 million of after-tax net earnings than we had forecasted during our December 11 Investor Day. That completely offset the slight shortfall in contingents that Pat mentioned earlier, in effect, a nice weather hedge for our total Corporate earnings. I know it isn't technically a hedge, but it certainly worked that way this quarter.
Second, you'll see that we had 2 favorable items that we have adjusted out. So looking at the last line in the fourth quarter table that's at the top of Page 9, that's the adjusted line, you'll see that our Corporate segment came in about $5 million better than the midpoint estimates we provided during our December IR Day. The first adjustment is the favorable impact of reorganizing our legal entity structure, a $22 million benefit from releasing the tax valuation allowance. It's not really a cash item this quarter, but it does help reduce our ongoing administrative cost. And it will reduce cash taxes paid over the next 10 years, it equates to a couple million dollars a year of cash savings going forward.
The second adjustment is an $8.9 million favorable impact from clarifying guidance issued last month related to the Tax Reform Act passed in December 2017. It clarifies how U.S. taxes -- how the U.S. taxes earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. I'll come back to the other Corporate segment line items in a few minutes when we get to the CFO Commentary.
Next, flip to Page 10 of the earnings release, the third item from the bottom called other. We did sell a small brokerage unit in January. We thought the product and customer service offering fit better with the buyer's underwriting business, so it ended up being a nice win-win for both of us.
Let's go now to the CFO Commentary document, to Page 2. We've now provided our first look at items for 2019. Two modeling notes: first, amortization expense. Please take a quick look at your Brokerage segment amortization picks. We're forecasting $74 million in the first quarter. And as the footnote says, you'll need to tick that up a couple million a quarter for M&A that we could do for the rest of the year, and that will get you close.
Second, the earnings from noncontrolling interest line. Our first quarter is when our Brokerage segment has the largest impact from earnings from noncontrolling interest. Please double check your models as this has caused some modeling noise in the past.
Let's now turn to Page 3, to the Corporate segment. Let me walk you through that page. First, the blue section is just a reprint of the Corporate shortcut tables from our earnings release this year. Next, we've added the yellow adjusted section to remove the favorable tax items I discussed with you a minute or so ago. We believe the yellow adjusted numbers are more helpful when comparing to both the gray section, and that's just a reprint of our estimates given last month during our December IR day, and in comparison to the pinkish section, which is our first estimates for 2019.
Let me take each line in that table. Interest and banking. Our fourth quarter came in better than our December estimates, call it $1 million dollars after-tax. Stronger cash flows in the fourth quarter kept us out of our line of credit. Our borrowings are a little bit lower. As for 2019, again in the pink column, you'll see that our estimates for interest expense are going up to reflect our additional $600 million of borrowings, as noted in Footnote 1 on that page and also in the 8-K we filed with our earnings release this afternoon. We'll use all of that for M&A, which I'll touch on later in my comments.
Moving down to the M&A expense line. M&A expenses ran a little hot in the fourth quarter, coming in about $4 million more than our estimates. It's simply more external legal and due diligence costs related to 2 international deals that we've recently announced and 1 larger domestic deal that we pulled the plug on in December.
Looking forward, we see 2019 more like the first 3 quarters of 2018 than we do the fourth quarter of '18. The Corporate line, adjusted fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than our December IR Day forecast. Looking forward, we again see 2019 being more consistent with adjusted 2018.
So let's go next to the impact of tax reform line. While the guidance gave us a benefit in 2018, unfortunately, other guidance takes away a different benefit in 2019. So you'll see that 2019 is more in line with the adjusted amounts in the yellow column. But again, it's very important to remind you that this line is mostly a book expense, not cash, because the additional taxes are nearly all offset by the use of our credits. In the end, tax reform has been a home run for Gallagher.
Finally, to clean energy. As I mentioned earlier, fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than we forecasted due to a cold last half of December. When you look at our full year 2018, we estimate that ideal weather patterns contributed about $8 million to our full year net earnings of $119 million. So now as we and our utility partners look out over 2019, we're not expecting increased production levels from another ideal weather year, rather, something closer to production levels we saw back in 2017. It's fantastic that we're still forecasting another year of over $100 million in net earnings, but we just don't see it as being amazing as it was in 2018.
Okay, let's flip to Page 5 of the CFO Commentary. You'll see that we've updated our roll-in revenue estimates for mergers that we have announced thus far this year. Here's why our first quarter was a little slow, but it's certainly not the case this year. For full year 2019, looks like we can do about $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of M&A with free cash and debt. That consists of $300 million of cash on hand, we'll generate another $700 million after our dividend here in 2019 plus another $600 million borrowing that I mentioned earlier. Of that, we use or will use about $500 million for mergers we have already announced and have included in our roll-in revenues in the table, meaning that we still have about $1 billion to fund additional M&A in 2019.
In 2018, our weighted average multiple was around 8.3x, and it equates to much lower than 8x when you factor in our tax credits, showing that we can execute our tuck-in merger strategy at fair pricing, which gives us a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple.
Okay, those are my comments. An excellent quarter to close out an outstanding year, and we're in a really terrific position to continue our success here in 2019.
Back to you, Pat."

We don't really cut back on those things that are building our franchise going forward. But rather, what we'll do is we'll be just a little bit slower to hire. And when you're having 10% of your workforce turn over every year, you can tighten your belt a little bit and reallocate work. And that tends to be what you can do in a recession. So the model is highly flexible to respond in a recession. And usually it's just a little tightening of the belt that allows us to get through just a modest recession."

I'm not going to change your systems. I just want you to send me the check every quarter and make sure you make as much of a margin as you can,"" that's not going to be somebody who's going to fit Gallagher. And so that's what we're doing every day, is trying to figure out who is going to fit. And then the second thing that I think we're pretty good at that is really important, is the entrepreneur going to stay? Because they're the connection to their people, and the people that are excited about joining us, because they are going to get capabilities and they are at a place that is stable and is not for sale, are the ones that fit. So yes, there's plenty of product out there. This is an incredible business. There's -- the baby boomers are looking at monetizing their life's work, and we're not just out buying baby boomers. And there are literally thousands of these agents and brokers that aren't even over $20 million of revenue. There's thousands of them. And so we offer, I think, a very, very stable home.

With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions. As we do each quarter, today Doug and I are going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those are #1, organic growth; #2, growing through mergers and acquisitions; 3, improving productivity and quality; and 4, maintaining our unique culture. The team delivered on all 4 of our operating priorities to be in the year resulting in a great first quarter.
Let me give you some highlights. Our core brokerage and risk management segments combined to deliver 14% growth in revenue, 5.5% all-in organic growth, an adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 75 basis points. We also completed 11 tuck-in mergers in the quarter and our culture was recognized again by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies. I couldn't be proud of the team just a great performance.
My comments today will be focused on revenue growth, insurance pricing, and our dynamic culture. Doug will go into greater detail on productivity, quality, green energy and capital management. 
So let me start with our brokerage segment. First quarter all-in organic growth was 5.7%, including base commission and fee growth pushing 5% and strong contingent and supplemental revenue growth.
Organic was solid across all of our divisions globally. 
Let me give you some more detail. In the U.S., our retail brokerage operations generated around 6% organic in the first quarter with benefits a bit lower, PC a bit higher. Domestic, retail PC pricing was positive across all our major lines of business, except for workers' compensation. For example, property and commercial auto pricing were up over 5%. And casualty and specialty lines were up a couple of points. Within our domestic wholesale PC business, organic was about 4% and relative to retail pricing similarly stronger across most lines of business.
Moving to the U.K. Our organic was around 5% in the quarter with retail a bit lower and wholesale a bit higher. Our retail PC pricing in the U.K. is up 3% on average with professional liability pricing up over 5% and low sales up a point or 2. The U.K. retail -- I'm sorry the U.K. specialty market is seeing rates up 5% on average and pricing on catastrophe exposed classes is up over 10%. 
Next in Australia and New Zealand. Organic was about 8%. Rates there continue to trend in the mid single digits across most lines. 
In total, I would characterize the market very similar to recent quarters, but we do see rate trending just a little higher than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
As we look forward, 2019 brokerage base commission and fee organic feels like it will be around 5%. 
Next let me talk about brokerage, merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 11 brokerage acquisitions at fair prices, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue. So far in the second quarter, we have completed 3 brokerage mergers, including Stackhouse Poland with estimated annual revenues of almost $80 million. 
I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
Looking forward, our merger and acquisition pipeline is very full. In addition to the previously announced JLT aerospace acquisition that we hope to close late in the second quarter, our pipeline has around $350 million of revenues associated with about 60 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.
While we won't close all these mergers, we continue to be the partner of choice for brokers that are excited about our capabilities, aligned with our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Next let me move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was a solid 4.1% with no significant variance between domestic and International operations. We recently announced our new GB specialty division, which is focused on the resolution of complex plans and construction, health care, transportation and products liability.
This has been an area of growth of Gallagher Bassett and the new GB specialty team will be showcased at the Annual RIMS Conference in Boston next week.
Also on display at RIMS  will be our new treatment of quality index and our smart claim benchmarking methodology. 2 recent examples of innovation that GB is utilizing to drive superior claim outcomes to our clients.
And finally, I'll touch on what really makes our company unique and that's our culture. It's a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people.
Just last month, Gallagher was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies, an award that underscores our commitment that ethical business standards and practices.
This is of our eighth year in a row of receiving the award, an accomplishment less than 40 companies globally can claim. And we were once again the sole insurance broker recognized. This distinction is a direct reflection of our 30,000 plus colleagues united working as a team grounded in the Gallagher way every day all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. 
Okay. An excellent quarter on all measures. I will stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

Okay. Let's turn to Page 2 of the earnings release to the brokerage segment. You'll see that we posted $1.45 of adjusted earnings per share. As you compare our results to your model, it looks like there are about 3 puts and takes compared to consensus. First, it looks like contingents came in better than most of you thought would add an additional $8 million or about $0.02 after incentive compensation taxes. However, there are 2 offsetting items. First, it looks like for M&A rollover revenues were above our March 12 guidance by about $8 million or $9 million.
And second, noncontrolling interest tax were lower than our March 12 guidance by about $2 million to $3 million.
Combined that $10 million to $12 million, we're about $0.03 after expenses and taxes going the other way. So net-net, these items about offset bringing us back to about $1.45 of EPS or even $1.46.
One last comment on Page 2 of the earnings release.
Only one significant non-GAAP adjustment this quarter. A onetime $0.17 net gain from divesting smaller brokerage operations in the first quarter. It's a bit of old news given we discussed the largest one during our January earnings release and conference call where you can see they're now. Otherwise, a very clean quarter. 
Next let's turn to Page 3 of the earnings release. The brokerage segment organic table at the top of the page and then go down a little bit to the contingent revenue section. That's where you'll see contingents been organically up $8 million in the first quarter as I just mentioned. About half of that arises because 2018 developed more favorably than previously estimated. The other half is due to new agreements and a slightly more bullish outlook for 2019 based on our view of premium growth and rate increases. Well remember that new GAAP accounting requires us to estimate these amounts many times mere a year or so before we receive them. So it does create a lot of estimation risk. Loss ratio is a lot decent now, but it does deteriorate over the year contingents might not develop we currently expect. 
Next let's turn to Page 4 to the brokerage EBITDAC margin table in the middle of the page. Terrific margin expansion this quarter, up by 61 basis point. Actually it would have been even better given stronger contingent commissions, but offsetting that is the roll in impact of M&A, which did compress margin expansion by about 60 basis points.
The dilutive impact of mergers on our first quarter might actually happen annually with first quarter now seasonally our largest. You will see margins are over 35% and then they drop into the mid-20s in later quarters. You can see that in last year numbers. Very few of our merger partners have that type of seasonality, especially in our P&C mergers.
they run annual margins that high. So most of them will naturally be dilutive to margin in the first quarter, but wouldn't have that impact on a full year basis. 
In the end, stronger contingent revenues offset by M&A roll-in margins about So being up 61 basis points feel about right when posting base organic growth of about 5%.
Still on Page 4, we're moving to the risk management segment organic growth table at the bottom of the page. You'll see that we posted 4.1% organic growth, that feels right for the full year. However, we feel a little lumpy. We see more like 2% in the second quarter because of its difficult comparison to last year's second quarter when we posted over 10% organic. So again, it will be a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but somewhere around 4% to 5% for the year.
Turning to Page 5 to the adjusted margin table at the bottom of the page. 17% margin it's up about 60 basis points and rises lower end of our 17% to 17.5% range for the full year. We still feel that range seems about right for the entire year. 
Turning to Page 6 the corporate segment table. Interest and banking line and the acquisition line right in line with the guidance we provided on our March 12 IR Day. Clean energy actually came in a little bit better than we thought at that time mostly due to better production in the last half of March than we saw in the first half of the month. 
And finally to the corporate line where tax reforms settling down. We have collapsed the line we previously called impact of U.S. tax reform into the corporate line. During our March IR Day, we forecasted those 2 lines when combined to $40 million after tax loss. You can see we came in about $4 million better, but much of that is timing of a couple of tax-related items. So when you get to the CFO commentary document, our full year 2019 forecast for this corporate line haven't changed that much. 
So let's go and shift to the CFO commentary document that can be found on our IR website to Page 2. 
You'll see that most of the first quarter items were in line with our March 12th forecast. And looking forward, foreign exchange integration and amortization are fairly straightforward. Then when you get to Page 5, that's where we provide our estimates for rollover revenues from M&A. As I mentioned before, please take an extra few minutes to tighten up your models for your role-in revenue And finally, cash and M&A. At March 31st, we have around $700 million of available cash on our balance sheet. About $350 million was used in early April to close on the Stackhouse merger leaving $350 million as free cash. That was expected free cash flow in the remainder of the year and maybe some more debt should bring our full M&A capacity to around $1.5 billion before using any stock. 
So those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter and we're in a terrific position to another successful year. Back to you, Pat"

In terms of London market and how we trade, we are confident from the beginning that the way with the wholesale business was run and managed was going to come through our view and it's just fine. And that's in fact what happened. So what you're going to see is business as usual, but it does get more costly operated in  England, regulatory pressure is greater and greater and that gives us opportunities on the M&A side and the team recruiting side. So really Gallagher is in a very good spot in London, around the U.K. and globally to take advantage of some of the dislocation."

Typically we've said rates and exposure has contributed something like 1% of our organic growth. This quarter, it was probably closer to 2. So when you hear my commentary on the rates around the world, don't take them the meaning that we're facing a farming hard market. Now there is offsets to that with. When DNO goes up, the worker's compensation is likely to go down. If you look at the last probably 11 or 12 years, and you look at the graphic that what's happened to PC rates, they'll go up to, they'll come down 3, they'll go up 4, they will 5 flat that is a really good market for us. I grew up in an environment where every 10 years there was total location. Rates were jumping 50% to 70%, insurance was a complete seller's market and clients were really unhappy. The market would then start to soften and anybody that had a license could beat you on a price sometimes very substantially just by getting to a market that nobody thought even had appetite. So with a market like this, our skill set really makes the difference. No one out there can just run to XYZ company, if this crazy logo, I mean, it does happen from time-to-time, but it's just not a general rule. So when we are working in the 2%, 5%, 3% up, 4% down environment, then the skill set makes all the difference in preparing the risk management approach for the client. So this is really good environment a little firmer and that's really what I mind that my remarks to say. Don't go out and say, waw, we're going into a higher market, a little firmer, and I think that's probably justified by capital losses and by some capacity shrinkage, particularly in the London market, and by other disciplined underwriters. You saw results. I mean, those guys are, they are smart underwriters."

It's not a big variance around the right So in our case, we might have several hundred or more contracts that all contribute, some of them bigger, some of them smaller to the contingent commission number so we're talking about a very small change estimate on a per contract basis. Looking forward, if we have good performance in 2018 on these contracts that developed a little bit better, it probably stands the reason that we might have a little bit better development on 2019 assuming we don't have loss ratios deteriorate subsequently between now and the end of the year. So as we ask towards -- as we stand here in the first quarter and when we're trying to estimate what we're going to get a year from now, we might be a little bit more optimistic today than we were a year ago at the same time. So may be if there are a couple of million bucks, but I don’t know if there is a large trend here. I think it's just more tightening up our estimates on a large variety of contracts."

And our creating journey uncreating some lower-cost labor locations. Right now, we have 6 locations around the world. We're pushing 5,000 employees there. And so as a result of that, we have a little bit of safety valve on wage inflation. So we think that our product activity lives not only using our off-shore centers of excellence, but also technology investments that we are making can help offset that natural wage inflation that you're seeing out there in the market. Competition for talent is getting tougher, but we do believe that we have a safety valve for that. So pressures down the margin, but we're going to come wage inflation. You're seeing in the real estate costs were going up. So that's in there where we have techniques in order to better utilize our real estate footprint. And then also just the amount of money that's necessary in order to have a rock-solid cyber platform in order to be able to deliver that technology needs, that's an expensive proposition. So looking at margin expansion, we have 5% organic growth that we can do 50 basis points of margin expansion. It's really good, especially when we're talking about 450 end terms that are coming in and we're talking left side where we were talking about wage inflation and we are talking about services are so necessary for our clients in the placement of their insurance and also paying their claims. That's really good work for us to that kind of margin expansion."

With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. As we do each quarter, today Doug and I are going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those are number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our productivity and quality; and four, maintaining our unique culture. The team delivered on all 4 of our operating priorities to begin the year, resulting in a great first quarter.
Let me give you some highlights. Our core brokerage and risk management segments combined to deliver 14% growth in revenue, 5.5% all-in organic growth, an adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 75 basis points. We also completed 11 tuck-in mergers in the quarter, and our culture was recognized again by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies. I couldn't be proud of the team, just a great performance.
My comments today will be focused on revenue growth, insurance pricing and our dynamic culture. Doug will go into greater detail on productivity, quality, clean energy and capital management. 
So let me start with our brokerage segment. First quarter all-in organic growth was 5.7% including base commission and fee growth pushing 5% and strong contingent and supplemental revenue growth. Organic was solid across all of our divisions globally. 
Let me give you some more detail. In the U.S., our retail brokerage operations generated around 6% organic in the first quarter with benefits a bit lower, PC a bit higher. Domestic retail PC pricing was positive across all our major lines of business, except for workers' compensation. For example, property and commercial auto pricing were up over 5%. And casualty and specialty lines were up a couple of points. Within our domestic wholesale PC business, organic was about 4% and relative to retail, pricing is similar or stronger across most lines of business.
Moving to the U.K. Our organic was around 5% in the quarter with retail a bit lower and wholesale a bit higher. Our retail PC pricing in the U.K. is up 3% on average with professional liability pricing up over 5% and most of the lines up 1 point or 2. The U.K. retail -- I'm sorry, the U.K. specialty market is seeing rates up 5% on average, and pricing on catastrophe-exposed classes is up over 10%. 
Next in Australia and New Zealand. Organic was about 8%. Rates there continue to trend in the mid-single digits across most lines. 
In total, I would characterize the market very similar to recent quarters, but we do see rate trending just a little higher than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018. As we look forward, 2019 brokerage base commission and fee organic feels like it will be around 5%. 
Next let me talk about brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 11 brokerage acquisitions at fair prices, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue. So far in the second quarter, we have completed 3 brokerage mergers, including Stackhouse Poland with estimated annual revenues of almost $80 million. 
I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
Looking forward, our merger and acquisition pipeline is very full. In addition to the previously announced JLT aerospace acquisition that we hope to close late in the second quarter, our pipeline has around $350 million of revenues associated with about 60 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. While we won't close all these mergers, we continue to be the partner of choice for brokers that are excited about our capabilities, aligned with our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Next let me move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was a solid 4.1% with no significant variance between domestic and international operations. We recently announced our new GB specialty division, which is focused on the resolution of complex claims in construction, health care, transportation and products liability.
This has been an area of growth for Gallagher Bassett, and the new GB specialty team will be showcased at the annual RIMS Conference in Boston next week.
Also on display at RIMS will be our new treatment quality index and our smart claim benchmarking methodology, 2 recent examples of innovation that GB is utilizing to drive superior claim outcomes for our clients.
And finally, I'll touch on what really makes our company unique, and that's our culture. It's a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people.
Just last month, Gallagher was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies, an award that underscores our commitment to ethical business standards and practices.
This is of our eighth year in a row receiving the award, an accomplishment less than 40 companies globally can claim. And we were once again the sole insurance broker recognized. This distinction is a direct reflection of our 30,000-plus colleagues united, working as a team, grounded in the Gallagher way. Every day, all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. 
Okay. An excellent quarter on all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

Gallagher & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top line results and a strong way to start off 2019. Today, I'll make a few comments referenced in the earnings release. I'll then move to the CFO commentary doc",1078,"Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top line results and a strong way to start off 2019. 
Today, I'll make a few comments referenced in the earnings release. I'll then move to the CFO commentary document we posted on our website, and then I'll wrap up with some comments on cash and M&A. 
Okay. Let's turn to Page 2 of the earnings release to the brokerage segment. You'll see that we posted $1.45 of adjusted earnings per share. As you compare our results to your model, it looks like there are about 3 puts and takes compared to consensus. First, it looks like contingents came in better than most of you thought, call it an additional $8 million or about $0.02 after incentive compensation and taxes. However, there are 2 offsetting items. First, it looks like your picks for M&A rollover revenues were above our March 12 guidance by about $8 million or $9 million. And second, noncontrolling interest picks were lower than our March 12 guidance by about $2 million to $3 million. Combined, that's $10 million to $12 million or about $0.03 after expenses and taxes going the other way. So net-net, these items about offset, bringing us back to about $1.45 of EPS or even $1.46.
One last comment on Page 2 of the earnings release. Only one significant non-GAAP adjustment this quarter, a onetime $0.17 net gain from divesting of some smaller brokerage operations in the first quarter. It's a bit of old news given we discussed the largest one during our January earnings release and conference call but you can see it there now. Otherwise, a very clean quarter. 
Next let's turn to Page 3 of the earnings release, to the brokerage segment organic table at the top of the page, and then go down a little bit to the contingent revenue section. That's where you'll see contingents being organically up $8 million in the first quarter as I just mentioned. About half of that arises because 2018 developed more favorably than previously estimated. The other half is due to new agreements and a slightly more bullish outlook for 2019 based on our view of premium growth and rate increases. But remember that new GAAP accounting requires us to estimate these amounts many times a year or so before we receive them. So it does create a lot of estimation risk. Loss ratios look decent now, but if those deteriorate over the year, contingents might not develop as we currently expect. 
Next let's turn to Page 4, to the brokerage EBITDAC margin table in the middle of the page. Terrific margin expansion this quarter, up by 61 basis point. Actually, it would have been even better given stronger contingent commissions, but offsetting that is the roll-in impact of M&A, which did compress margin expansion by about 60 basis points.
The dilutive impact of mergers on our first quarter may actually happen annually. With first quarter now seasonally our largest, you'll see margins are over 35%, and then they drop into the mid-20s in later quarters. You can see that in last year's numbers. Very few of our merger partners have that type of seasonality, especially in our P&C mergers, nor do they run annual margins that high. So most of them will naturally be dilutive to margin in the first quarter but wouldn't have that impact on a full year basis. 
In the end, stronger contingent revenues offset by M&A roll-in margins about wash. So being up 61 basis points feels about right when posting base organic growth of about 5%.
Still on Page 4 but moving to the risk management segment organic growth table at the bottom of the page. You'll see that we posted 4.1% organic growth. That feels right for the full year. However, we see a little lumpy. We see more like 2% in the second quarter because of a difficult comparison to last year's second quarter when we posted over 10% organic. So again, it will be a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter but somewhere around 4% to 5% for the year.
Turning to Page 5, to the adjusted margin table at the bottom of the page. 17 points of margin, add up over 60 basis points, and right at the lower end of our 17% to 17.5% range for the full year. We still feel that, that range seems about right for an entire year. 
Turning to Page 6, to the corporate segment table. Interest and banking line and the acquisition line, right in line with the guidance we provided on our March 12 IR Day. Clean energy actually came in a little better than we thought at that time mostly due to better production in the last half of March than we saw in the first half of the month. 
And finally to the corporate line. With tax reforms settling down, we have collapsed the line we previously called impact of U.S. tax reform into the corporate line. During our March IR Day, we forecasted those 2 lines combined to a $14 million after-tax loss. You can see we came in about $4 million better, but much of that is timing of a couple of tax-related items. So when you get to the CFO commentary document, our full year 2019 forecast for this corporate line hasn't changed that much. 
So let's go ahead and shift to the CFO commentary document that can be found on our IR website, to Page 2. 
You'll see that most of the first quarter items were in line with our March 12 forecast. And looking forward, foreign exchange integration and amortization are fairly straightforward. Then when you get to Page 5, that's where we provide our estimate for rollover revenues from M&A. As I mentioned before, please take an extra few minutes to tighten up your models for your roll-in revenue picks. And finally, cash and M&A. At March 31, we have around $700 million of available cash on our balance sheet. About $350 million was used in early April to close on the Stackhouse merger, leaving $350 million as free cash. That plus expected free cash for the remainder of the year and maybe some more debt should bring our full M&A capacity to around $1.5 billion before using any stock. 
So those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter, and we're in a terrific position for another successful year. Back to you, Pat."

In terms of the London market and how we trade, we are confident from the beginning that the way the wholesale business was run and managed was going to come through review, and it's just fine. And that's in fact what happened. So what you're going to see is business as usual, but it does get more costly to operate in London. Regulatory pressure is greater and greater, and that gives us opportunities on the M&A side and the team recruiting side. So really Gallagher is in a very good spot in London, around the U.K. and globally to take advantage of some of the dislocation."

Typically, we've said rate and exposure has contributed something like 1% of our organic growth. This quarter, it was probably closer to 2%. So when you hear my commentary on the rates around the world, don't take them to mean that we're facing a firming, hard market. There's offsets to that. When D&O goes up, workers' compensation is likely to go down. If you look at the last probably 11 or 12 years and you look at a graphic of what's happened to PC rates, they'll go up 2%, they'll come down 3%, they'll go up 4%, they'll be 5% flat, that is a really good market for us. I grew up in an environment where every 10 years there was total dislocation. Rates were jumping 50% to 70%. 
Insurance was a complete sellers' market, and clients were really unhappy. The market would then start to soften, and anybody that had a license could beat you on a price sometimes very substantially just by getting to a market that nobody thought even had appetite. So with a market like this, our skill set really makes the difference. No one out there can just run to XYZ company, if this crazy [ logo ], I mean it does happen from time to time, but it's just not a general rule. So when we're working in the 2%, 5%, 3% up, 4% down environment, then the skill set makes all the difference in preparing the risk management approach for the client. 
So this is really a good environment, a little firmer, and that's really what I want in my remarks to say. Don't go out and say, wow, we're going into a hard market. A little firmer, and I think that's probably justified by cat losses and by some capacity shrinkage, particularly in the London market, and by other disciplined underwriters. You saw Travelers' results. I mean those guys are -- they're smart underwriters."

Second of all, in our case, we might have several hundred or more contracts that all contribute, some of them bigger, some of them smaller, to the contingent commission number. So we're talking about a very small change in estimate on a per contract basis. Looking forward, if we have good performance in 2018 on these contracts that developed a little bit better, it probably stands to reason that we might have a little bit better development on 2019 assuming we don't have loss ratios deteriorate substantially between now and the end of the year. 
So as we ask -- or as we stand here in the first quarter and we're trying to estimate what we're going to get a year from now, we might be a little bit more optimistic today than we were a year ago at this same time.

Right now, we have 6 locations around the world. We're pushing 5,000 employees there. And so as a result of that, we have a little bit of a safety valve on wage inflation. So we think that our productivity lifts not only using our off-shore centers of excellence but also through technology investments that we're making can help offset that natural wage inflation that you're seeing out there in the market. 
Competition for talent is getting tougher, but we do believe that we have a safety valve for that. So pressures on the margin aren't going to come from wage inflation. You're seeing the real estate costs are going up. So that's in there, but we have techniques in order to better utilize our real estate footprint. And then also just the amount of money that's necessary in order to have a rock-solid cyber platform in order to be able to deliver the technology needs, that's an expensive proposition in itself. So looking at margin expansion, we have 5% organic growth that we can do 50 basis points of margin expansion. It's really good especially when we're talking about 450 interns that are coming in. We're talking about cyber. We're talking about wage inflation.

You also have the whole distracted driver thing, which is really driving a big part of the auto market being very tough. But they're also bleeding over into some of the losses in the comp world. 
And so I think that's a natural thing. When we go into some form of a recession, our claim counts generally drop pretty substantially because our clients are reducing workloads and closing down shifts. Now shifts are pretty robust, and you have a little bit more -- and hopefully, our clients' loss control that we assist on can help mitigate that.

The other thing is I think you're going to find more and more carriers and captives outsourcing their work either in lines of cover that they want to get into, geographies they want to get into and in some instances, full-on situations like their entire risk management book. It's becoming a much more relevant approach.

With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. As we do each quarter, today Doug and I are going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those are number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our productivity and quality; and four, maintaining our unique culture. The team delivered on all 4 of our operating priorities to begin the year, resulting in a great first quarter.
Let me give you some highlights. Our core brokerage and risk management segments combined to deliver 14% growth in revenue, 5.5% all-in organic growth, an adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 75 basis points. We also completed 11 tuck-in mergers in the quarter, and our culture was recognized again by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies. I couldn't be prouder of the team, just a great performance.
My comments today will be focused on revenue growth, insurance pricing and our dynamic culture. Doug will go into greater detail on productivity, quality, clean energy and capital management. 
So let me start with our brokerage segment. First quarter all-in organic growth was 5.7% including base commission and fee growth pushing 5% and strong contingent and supplemental revenue growth. Organic was solid across all of our divisions globally. 
Let me give you some more detail. In the U.S., our retail brokerage operations generated around 6% organic in the first quarter with benefits a bit lower, PC a bit higher. Domestic retail PC pricing was positive across all our major lines of business, except for workers' compensation. For example, property and commercial auto pricing were up over 5%. And casualty and specialty lines were up a couple of points. Within our domestic wholesale PC business, organic was about 4% and relative to retail, pricing is similar or stronger across most lines of business.
Moving to the U.K. Our organic was around 5% in the quarter with retail a bit lower and wholesale a bit higher. Our retail PC pricing in the U.K. is up 3% on average with professional liability pricing up over 5% and most of the lines up 1 point or 2. The U.K. retail -- I'm sorry, the U.K. specialty market is seeing rates up 5% on average, and pricing on catastrophe-exposed classes is up over 10%. 
Next in Australia and New Zealand. Organic was about 8%. Rates there continue to trend in the mid-single digits across most lines. 
In total, I would characterize the market very similar to recent quarters, but we do see rate trending just a little higher than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018. As we look forward, 2019 brokerage base commission and fee organic feels like it will be around 5%. 
Next let me talk about brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 11 brokerage acquisitions at fair prices, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue. So far in the second quarter, we have completed 3 brokerage mergers, including Stackhouse Poland with estimated annual revenues of almost $80 million. 
I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
Looking forward, our merger and acquisition pipeline is very full. In addition to the previously announced JLT aerospace acquisition that we hope to close late in the second quarter, our pipeline has around $350 million of revenues associated with about 60 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. While we won't close all these mergers, we continue to be the partner of choice for brokers that are excited about our capabilities, aligned with our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Next let me move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was a solid 4.1% with no significant variance between domestic and international operations. We recently announced our new GB specialty division, which is focused on the resolution of complex claims in construction, health care, transportation and products liability.
This has been an area of growth for Gallagher Bassett, and the new GB specialty team will be showcased at the annual RIMS Conference in Boston next week.
Also on display at RIMS will be our new treatment quality index and our smart claim benchmarking methodology, 2 recent examples of innovation that GB is utilizing to drive superior claim outcomes for our clients.
And finally, I'll touch on what really makes our company unique, and that's our culture. It's a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people.
Just last month, Gallagher was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies, an award that underscores our commitment to ethical business standards and practices.
This is of our eighth year in a row receiving the award, an accomplishment less than 40 companies globally can claim. And we were once again the sole insurance broker recognized. This distinction is a direct reflection of our 30,000-plus colleagues united, working as a team, grounded in the Gallagher way. Every day, all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. 
Okay. An excellent quarter on all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top line results and a strong way to start off 2019. 
Today, I'll make a few comments referencing the earnings release. I'll then move to the CFO commentary document we posted on our website, and then I'll wrap up with some comments on cash and M&A. 
Okay. Let's turn to Page 2 of the earnings release to the brokerage segment. You'll see that we posted $1.45 of adjusted earnings per share. As you compare our results to your models, it looks like there are about 3 puts and takes compared to consensus. First, it looks like contingents came in better than most of you thought, call it an additional $8 million or about $0.02 after incentive compensation and taxes. However, there are 2 offsetting items. First, it looks like your picks for M&A rollover revenues were above our March 12 guidance by about $8 million or $9 million. And second, noncontrolling interest picks were lower than our March 12 guidance by about $2 million to $3 million. Combined, that's $10 million to $12 million or about $0.03 after expenses and taxes going the other way. So net-net, these items about offset, bringing us back to about $1.45 of EPS or even $1.46.
One last comment on Page 2 of the earnings release. Only one significant non-GAAP adjustment this quarter, a onetime $0.17 net gain from divesting of some smaller brokerage operations in the first quarter. It's a bit of old news given we discussed the largest one during our January earnings release and conference call but you can see it there now. Otherwise, a very clean quarter. 
Next let's turn to Page 3 of the earnings release, to the brokerage segment organic table at the top of the page, and then go down a little bit to the contingent revenue section. That's where you'll see contingents being organically up $8 million in the first quarter as I just mentioned. About half of that arises because 2018 developed more favorably than previously estimated. The other half is due to new agreements and a slightly more bullish outlook for 2019 based on our view of premium growth and rate increases. But remember that new GAAP accounting requires us to estimate these amounts many times a year or so before we receive them. So it does create a lot of estimation risk. Loss ratios look decent now, but if those deteriorate over the year, contingents might not develop as we currently expect. 
Next let's turn to Page 4, to the brokerage EBITDAC margin table in the middle of the page. Terrific margin expansion this quarter, up by 61 basis points. Actually, it would have been even better given stronger contingent commissions, but offsetting that is the roll-in impact of M&A, which did compress margin expansion by about 60 basis points.
The dilutive impact of mergers on our first quarter may actually happen annually. With first quarter now seasonally our largest, you'll see margins are over 35%, and then they drop into the mid-20s in later quarters. You can see that in last year's numbers. Very few of our merger partners have that type of seasonality, especially in our P&C mergers, nor do they run annual margins that high. So most of them will naturally be dilutive to margin in the first quarter but wouldn't have that impact on a full year basis. 
In the end, stronger contingent revenues offset by M&A roll-in margins about wash. So being up 61 basis points feels about right when posting base organic growth of about 5%.
Still on Page 4 but moving to the risk management segment organic growth table at the bottom of the page. You'll see that we posted 4.1% organic growth. That feels right for the full year. However, we see a little lumpy. We see more like 2% in the second quarter because of a difficult comparison to last year's second quarter when we posted over 10% organic. So again, it will be a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter but somewhere around 4% to 5% for the year.
Turning to Page 5, to the adjusted margin table at the bottom of the page. 17 points of margin, that's up over 60 basis points, and right at the lower end of our 17% to 17.5% range for the full year. We still feel that, that range seems about right for an entire year. 
Turning to Page 6, to the corporate segment table. Interest and banking line and the acquisition line, right in line with the guidance we provided at our March 12 IR Day. Clean energy actually came in a little better than we thought at that time mostly due to better production in the last half of March than we saw in the first half of the month. 
And finally to the corporate line. With tax reforms settling down, we have collapsed the line we previously called impact of U.S. tax reform into the corporate line. During our March IR Day, we forecasted those 2 lines combined to a $14 million after-tax loss. You can see we came in about $4 million better, but much of that is timing of a couple of tax-related items. So when you get to the CFO commentary document, our full year 2019 forecast for this corporate line hasn't changed that much. 
So let's go ahead and shift to the CFO commentary document that can be found on our IR website, to Page 2. 
You'll see that most of the first quarter items were in line with our March 12 forecast. And looking forward, foreign exchange integration and amortization are fairly straightforward. Then when you get to Page 5, that's where we provide our estimate for rollover revenues from M&A. As I mentioned before, please take an extra few minutes to tighten up your models for your roll-in revenue picks. And finally, cash and M&A. At March 31, we have around $700 million of available cash on our balance sheet. About $350 million was used in early April to close on the Stackhouse merger, leaving $350 million as free cash. That plus expected free cash for the remainder of the year and maybe some more debt should bring our full M&A capacity to around $1.5 billion before using any stock. 
So those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter, and we're in a terrific position for another successful year. Back to you, Pat."

In this case, the acquisitions that are rolling in right now don't have big seasonality in them like we had last year in the third quarter.

In terms of the London market and how we trade, we are confident from the beginning that the way the wholesale business was run and managed was going to come through review just fine. And that's in fact what happened. So what you're going to see is business as usual, but it does get more costly to operate in London. Regulatory pressure is greater and greater, and that gives us opportunities on the M&A side and the team recruiting side.

Typically, we've said rate and exposure has contributed something like 1% of our organic growth. This quarter, it was probably closer to 2%. So when you hear my commentary on the rates around the world, don't take them to mean that we're facing a firming, hard market. There's offsets to that. When D&O goes up, workers' compensation is likely to go down. If you look at the last probably 11 or 12 years and you look at a graphic of what's happened to PC rates, they'll go up 2%, they'll come down 3%, they'll go up 4%, they'll be 5% flat, that is a really good market for us. I grew up in an environment where every 10 years there was total dislocation, rates were jumping 50% to 70%, 
insurance was a complete sellers' market and clients were really unhappy. The market would then start to soften, and anybody that had a license could beat you on a price sometimes very substantially just by getting to a market that nobody thought even had appetite. So with a market like this, our skill set really makes a difference. No one out there can just run to XYZ company, get this crazy [ logo ], I mean it does happen from time to time, but it's just not a general rule. So when we're working in the 2%, 5%, 3% up, 4% down environment, then the skill set makes all the difference in preparing the risk management approach for the client. 
So this is really a good environment, a little firmer, and that's really what I want in my remarks to say. Don't go out and say, wow, we're going into a hard market. A little firmer, and I think that's probably justified by cat losses and by some capacity shrinkage, in particular, in the London market, and by other disciplined underwriters. You saw Travelers' results. I mean those guys are -- they're smart underwriters."

So when we're talking about tightening up a $90 million estimate by $3 million or something like that is really what's happening here. It's not a big variance around the pack, right? 
Second of all, in our case, we might have several hundred or more contracts that all contribute, some of them bigger, some of them smaller, to the contingent commission number. So we're talking about a very small change in estimate on a per contract basis. Looking forward, if we had good performance in 2018 on these contracts that developed a little bit better, it probably stands to reason that we might have a little bit better development on 2019 assuming we don't have loss ratios deteriorate substantially between now and the end of the year. 
So as we ask -- or as we stand here in the first quarter and we're trying to estimate what we're going to get a year from now, we might be a little bit more optimistic today than we were a year ago at this same time. So maybe it's a couple of million bucks, but I don’t know if there's a large trend here. I think it's just more just tightening up our estimates on a large variety of contracts."

So we think that our productivity lifts not only using our off-shore centers of excellence but also through technology investments that we're making can help offset that natural wage inflation that you're seeing out there in the market. 
Competition for talent is getting tougher, but we do believe that we have a safety valve for that. So pressures on the margin are going to come from wage inflation. You're seeing the real estate costs are going up. So that's in there, but we have techniques in order to better utilize our real estate footprint. And then also just the amount of money that's necessary in order to have a rock-solid cyber platform in order to be able to deliver the technology needs, that's an expensive proposition in itself. So looking at margin expansion, when we have 5% organic growth if we can do 50 basis points of margin expansion it's really good, especially when we're talking about 450 interns that are coming in. We're talking about cyber. We're talking about wage inflation. We're talking about other services that are so necessary for our clients in the placement of their insurance and then also paying their claims.

With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions. As we do each quarter, today Doug and I are going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those are number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our productivity and quality; and four, maintaining our unique culture. The team delivered on all 4 of our operating priorities to begin the year, resulting in a great first quarter.
Let me give you some highlights. Our core brokerage and risk management segments combined to deliver 14% growth in revenue, 5.5% all-in organic growth, an adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 75 basis points. We also completed 11 tuck-in mergers in the quarter, and our culture was recognized again by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies. I couldn't be prouder of the team, just a great performance. My comments today will be focused on revenue growth, insurance pricing and our dynamic culture. Doug will go into greater detail on productivity, quality, clean energy and capital management. 
So let me start with our brokerage segment. First quarter all-in organic growth was 5.7% including base commission and fee growth pushing 5% and strong contingent and supplemental revenue growth. Organic was solid across all of our divisions globally. 
Let me give you some more detail. In the U.S., our retail brokerage operations generated around 6% organic in the first quarter with benefits a bit lower, PC a bit higher. Domestic retail PC pricing was positive across all our major lines of business, except for workers' compensation. For example, property and commercial auto pricing were up over 5%. And casualty and specialty lines were up a couple of points. Within our domestic wholesale PC business, organic was about 4% and relative to retail, pricing is similar or stronger across most lines of business.
Moving to the U.K. Our organic was around 5% in the quarter with retail a bit lower and wholesale a bit higher. Our retail PC pricing in the U.K. is up 3% on average with professional liability pricing up over 5% and most of the lines up 1 point or 2. The U.K. retail -- I'm sorry, the U.K. specialty market is seeing rates up 5% on average, and pricing on catastrophe-exposed classes is up over 10%. 
Next in Australia and New Zealand. Organic was about 8%. Rates there continue to trend in the mid-single digits across most lines. 
In total, I would characterize the market very similar to recent quarters, but we do see rate trending just a little higher than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018. As we look forward, 2019 brokerage base commission and fee organic feels like it will be around 5%. 
Next let me talk about brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 11 brokerage acquisitions at fair prices, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue. So far in the second quarter, we have completed 3 brokerage mergers, including Stackhouse Poland with estimated annual revenues of almost $80 million. 
I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
Looking forward, our merger and acquisition pipeline is very full. In addition to the previously announced JLT aerospace acquisition that we hope to close late in the second quarter, our pipeline has around $350 million of revenues associated with about 60 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. While we won't close all these mergers, we continue to be the partner of choice for brokers that are excited about our capabilities, aligned with our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.
Next let me move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was a solid 4.1% with no significant variance between domestic and international operations. We recently announced our new GB specialty division, which is focused on the resolution of complex claims in construction, health care, transportation and products liability. This has been an area of growth for Gallagher Bassett, and the new GB specialty team will be showcased at the annual RIMS Conference in Boston next week. Also on display at RIMS will be our new treatment quality index and our smart claim benchmarking methodology, 2 recent examples of innovation that GB is utilizing to drive superior claim outcomes for our clients.
And finally, I'll touch on what really makes our company unique, and that's our culture. It's a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people. Just last month, Gallagher was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies, an award that underscores our commitment to ethical business standards and practices. This is of our eighth year in a row receiving the award, an accomplishment less than 40 companies globally can claim. And we were once again the sole insurance broker recognized. This distinction is a direct reflection of our 30,000-plus colleagues united, working as a team, grounded in the Gallagher way. Every day, all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture. Okay. An excellent quarter on all measures. 
I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top line results and a strong way to start off 2019. 
Today, I'll make a few comments referencing the earnings release. I'll then move to the CFO commentary document we posted on our website, and then I'll wrap up with some comments on cash and M&A. 
Okay. Let's turn to Page 2 of the earnings release to the brokerage segment. You'll see that we posted $1.45 of adjusted earnings per share. As you compare our results to your models, it looks like there are about 3 puts and takes compared to consensus. First, it looks like contingents came in better than most of you thought, call it an additional $8 million or about $0.02 after incentive compensation and taxes. However, there are 2 offsetting items. First, it looks like your picks for M&A rollover revenues were above our March 12 guidance by about $8 million or $9 million. And second, noncontrolling interest picks were lower than our March 12 guidance by about $2 million to $3 million. Combined, that's $10 million to $12 million or about $0.03 after expenses and taxes going the other way. So net-net, these items about offset, bringing us back to about $1.45 of EPS or even $1.46. One last comment on Page 2 of the earnings release. Only one significant non-GAAP adjustment this quarter, a onetime $0.17 net gain from divesting of some smaller brokerage operations in the first quarter. It's a bit of old news given we discussed the largest one during our January earnings release and conference call but you can see it there now. Otherwise, a very clean quarter. 
Next let's turn to Page 3 of the earnings release, to the brokerage segment organic table at the top of the page, and then go down a little bit to the contingent revenue section. That's where you'll see contingents being organically up $8 million in the first quarter as I just mentioned. About half of that arises because 2018 developed more favorably than previously estimated. The other half is due to new agreements and a slightly more bullish outlook for 2019 based on our view of premium growth and rate increases. But remember that new GAAP accounting requires us to estimate these amounts many times a year or so before we receive them. So it does create a lot of estimation risk. Loss ratios look decent now, but if those deteriorate over the year, contingents might not develop as we currently expect. 
Next let's turn to Page 4, to the brokerage EBITDAC margin table in the middle of the page. Terrific margin expansion this quarter, up by 61 basis points. Actually, it would have been even better given stronger contingent commissions, but offsetting that is the roll-in impact of M&A, which did compress margin expansion by about 60 basis points. The dilutive impact of mergers on our first quarter may actually happen annually. With first quarter now seasonally our largest, you'll see margins are over 35%, and then they drop into the mid-20s in later quarters. You can see that in last year's numbers. Very few of our merger partners have that type of seasonality, especially in our P&C mergers, nor do they run annual margins that high. So most of them will naturally be dilutive to margin in the first quarter but wouldn't have that impact on a full year basis. In the end, stronger contingent revenues offset by M&A roll-in margins about wash. So being up 61 basis points feels about right when posting base organic growth of about 5%.
Still on Page 4 but moving to the risk management segment organic growth table at the bottom of the page. You'll see that we posted 4.1% organic growth. That feels right for the full year. However, we see a little lumpy. We see more like 2% in the second quarter because of a difficult comparison to last year's second quarter when we posted over 10% organic. So again, it will be a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter but somewhere around 4% to 5% for the year.
Turning to Page 5, to the adjusted margin table at the bottom of the page. 17 points of margin, that's up over 60 basis points, and right at the lower end of our 17% to 17.5% range for the full year. We still feel that, that range seems about right for an entire year. 
Turning to Page 6, to the corporate segment table. Interest and banking line and the acquisition line, right in line with the guidance we provided at our March 12 IR Day. Clean energy actually came in a little better than we thought at that time mostly due to better production in the last half of March than we saw in the first half of the month. And finally to the corporate line. With tax reforms settling down, we have collapsed the line we previously called impact of U.S. tax reform into the corporate line. During our March IR Day, we forecasted those 2 lines combined to a $14 million after-tax loss. You can see we came in about $4 million better, but much of that is timing of a couple of tax-related items. So when you get to the CFO commentary document, our full year 2019 forecast for this corporate line hasn't changed that much. 
So let's go ahead and shift to the CFO commentary document that can be found on our IR website, to Page 2. You'll see that most of the first quarter items were in line with our March 12 forecast. And looking forward, foreign exchange integration and amortization are fairly straightforward. Then when you get to Page 5, that's where we provide our estimate for rollover revenues from M&A. As I mentioned before, please take an extra few minutes to tighten up your models for your roll-in revenue picks. And finally, cash and M&A. At March 31, we have around $700 million of available cash on our balance sheet. About $350 million was used in early April to close on the Stackhouse merger, leaving $350 million as free cash. That plus expected free cash for the remainder of the year and maybe some more debt should bring our full M&A capacity to around $1.5 billion before using any stock. 
So those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter, and we're in a terrific position for another successful year. Back to you, Pat."

In this case, the acquisitions that are rolling in right now don't have big seasonality in them like we had last year in the third quarter. So because we posted nearly 36 points of margin this quarter, the impact will be more dramatic in the first quarter. When you get to the second and third quarter, maybe it's 10 basis points, something like that."

Typically, we've said rate and exposure has contributed something like 1% of our organic growth. This quarter, it was probably closer to 2%. So when you hear my commentary on the rates around the world, don't take them to mean that we're facing a firming, hard market. There's offsets to that. When D&O goes up, workers' compensation is likely to go down. If you look at the last probably 11 or 12 years and you look at a graphic of what's happened to PC rates, they'll go up 2%, they'll come down 3%, they'll go up 4%, they'll be 5% flat, that is a really good market for us. I grew up in an environment where every 10 years there was total dislocation, rates were jumping 50% to 70%, 
insurance was a complete sellers' market and clients were really unhappy. The market would then start to soften, and anybody that had a license could beat you on a price sometimes very substantially just by getting to a market that nobody thought even had appetite. So with a market like this, our skill set really makes a difference. No one out there can just run to XYZ company, get this crazy [ logo ], I mean it does happen from time to time, but it's just not a general rule. So when we're working in the 2%, 5%, 3% up, 4% down environment, then the skill set makes all the difference in preparing the risk management approach for the client. 
So this is really a good environment, a little firmer, and that's really what I want in my remarks to say. Don't go out and say, wow, we're going into a hard market. A little firmer, and I think that's probably justified by cat losses and by some capacity shrinkage, in particular, in the London market, and by other disciplined underwriters. You saw Travelers' results. I mean those guys are -- they're smart underwriters."

Second of all, in our case, we might have several hundred or more contracts that all contribute, some of them bigger, some of them smaller, to the contingent commission number. So we're talking about a very small change in estimate on a per contract basis. Looking forward, if we had good performance in 2018 on these contracts that developed a little bit better, it probably stands to reason that we might have a little bit better development on 2019 assuming we don't have loss ratios deteriorate substantially between now and the end of the year. 
So as we ask -- or as we stand here in the first quarter and we're trying to estimate what we're going to get a year from now, we might be a little bit more optimistic today than we were a year ago at this same time.

So we think that our productivity lifts not only using our off-shore centers of excellence but also through technology investments that we're making can help offset that natural wage inflation that you're seeing out there in the market. 
Competition for talent is getting tougher, but we do believe that we have a safety valve for that. So pressures on the margin are going to come from wage inflation. You're seeing the real estate costs are going up. So that's in there, but we have techniques in order to better utilize our real estate footprint. And then also just the amount of money that's necessary in order to have a rock-solid cyber platform in order to be able to deliver the technology needs, that's an expensive proposition in itself. So looking at margin expansion, when we have 5% organic growth if we can do 50 basis points of margin expansion it's really good, especially when we're talking about 450 interns that are coming in. We're talking about cyber. We're talking about wage inflation.

With me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Today, as we do each quarter, Doug and I are going to report on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; number three, improving our productivity and quality; and number four, maintaining our unique culture. Once again, the team delivered on all 4 of our strategic priorities, and I couldn't be more pleased. We really do have some terrific momentum. Let me give you some second quarter financial highlights for our combined core Brokerage and Risk Management segments: 12% growth in revenues; 5.3% all-in organic growth; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 49 basis points; and we completed 13 mergers with about $195 million of estimated annualized revenues. Just another outstanding quarter for the team. Let me break down our results by segment.
Our Brokerage segment second quarter organic was 5.8% all-in. There was some geography change between base and supplementals in the quarter so think of base organic more like 5.9% and organic for contingents and supplementals combined of about 4.5%., a really nice quarter. All of our divisions globally contributed. Our domestic retail brokerage operations had a great quarter with organic of about 5%. PC operations were slightly better than that, and our benefits operations a bit below. Our U.S. wholesale and program business had an excellent base organic quarter posting more than 5% with contingents and supplemental revenue growth above that. Internationally, our brokerage operations combined to post about 8% organic on very broad-based strength in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Just fantastic results wherever I look in our business.
Moving on to the rate environment. Our internal data and our internal midyear rate survey are indicating a trend of increasing property/casualty pricing. Almost 75% of our producers surveyed indicated rates increased during the second quarter renewals, called approaching about 5% with international a bit higher and domestic a bit below that. What caught my attention though is that about 15% of our surveyed producers indicated they were seeing rates of more than 10%, very few indicated that level of increase last year. Let me give you some more detail by geography. 
I'll start in the U.S. Rate overall is up about 4% in our retail operations, with the greatest increases across commercial auto, property and umbrella. Most other casualty lines are flat to up a few points, while workers' compensation rates remained in negative territory, down about 3%. Staying in the U.S., pure rate within our wholesale operations RPS is up 5% to 6%, with price increases in low double digits for many property-related lines, especially on large or loss impacted accounts. Additionally, medical malpractice, general liability and umbrella are experiencing average price increases of about 5%, while comp, casualty and some professional lines are closer to flat. 
Let me move to the U.K. Overall pricing is up about 5%. However, a different environment in retail and our specialty operations. U.K. retail pricing is up about 3%, while pricing is increasing in our U.K. wholesale operations by almost 8%. Here it seem to be pushing for more rate in casualty-oriented lines, such as D&O and E&O and general liability, in addition to the property.
In Canada, pricing is up 4.5% with property, auto and medical malpractice rate increases in the high single digits. Most other casualty lines are closer to flat. 
And finally, in Australia and New Zealand, pricing is up around 7%, which is very similar to what we have been seeing for the past 2 years. 
So to sum it up, around the world, property/casualty rates are up close to 5% and exposures are still growing. This is when we excel. Our talented production staff is fully engaged helping clients and prospects mitigate the challenges of our an increasing rate environment.
Next, let me talk about Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 13 Brokerage acquisitions, which should add about  $195 million of estimated annualized revenue. I was in the U.K. just 3 weeks ago and was able to meet with our new Stackhouse Poland and aerospace colleagues. I couldn't be more excited about them joining our team. Together, these 2 mergers account for about 75% of our acquired revenues this quarter and give us a top-notch U.K. high net worth business and make us an industry leader in aerospace brokerage overnight. The other 11 mergers average about $5 million in annual revenues, which is more consistent with our historical tuck-in merger and acquisition strategy. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
As I look at our merger and acquisition pipeline, I see mor than $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed upon or being prepared. None of these 50 brokerage mergers have more than  $40 million of annual revenues. We know that not all these transactions will close, but it illustrates our pipeline is still very strong and full of small tuck-in opportunities run by entrepreneurs with excellent sales skills and client relationships. 
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Second quarter organic growth was 3%, in line with the estimate we provided at our Investor Day in June. Recall we posted over 10% last year in the second quarter so it made for a difficult comparison this year, but still very respectable. In the U.S., claim counts are increasing year-over-year as our clients' businesses grow. Call claim counts up about 2%. Our expanded specialty offerings are generating encouraging new business leads and wins, while our insurance carrier business continues its positive momentum. In fact, last year alone, we paid out claims totaling over  $1.5 billion on behalf of our insurance carrier clients. Growth in these areas has been driven by investments in analytics and innovative technologies that are delivering positive claim outcome for our clients.
Outside the U.S., growth was strong in the U.K. while Australia was weaker due to lower performance bonus fees, which can be lumpy from year to year. Looking forward, we are expecting stronger organic growth in the second half of 2019 due to some new client wins, and we think organic for the full year should be in the mid-single digit range.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on Gallagher's unique culture. Our culture is really about our colleagues and the rock-solid foundation and they form based on every interaction we have with clients, underwriters and with each other across divisions and around the world. Our culture makes our franchise distinctive, and it's why we are constantly looking for the right people to join us whether through new hires, mergers and acquisitions or internship program. Next month, we will conclude our 54th year of the Gallagher Summer Internship Program. This rigorous 2-month program for nearly 500 young men and women is an essential investment in our future to ensure our unique culture thrives for many years to come. 
Okay, a great first half, which bodes work for another excellent year. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top and bottom line results. Combined with terrific first quarter, it puts us in a great spot halfway through the year. Today, I will amplify a few comments that Pat made from the earnings release. I'll move to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our website, and then I'll conclude my usual comments on cash and M&A. 
All right. To the Brokerage Segment, organic growth on Page 3 of the earnings release. A great quarter of upper 5%, nearly 6%. As we look forward, we see it more like 5% than 6% as we had a really strong third quarter last year so that creates a tough compare this year. As for Brokerage margin, for the quarter, we delivered about 50 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Looking forward, that seems about right in this environment. Organic up 5% should yield about 50 basis points. 
Risk Management. We posted 3% organic growth and 17.5% adjusted margins this quarter. That's right in line with what we forecasted at our June IR day and great performance by the team, especially considering the second quarter 2018. As Pat said, we posted over 10% organic and 17.6% in adjusted margins. 
Looking towards the second half at our Risk Management segment, we're seeing organic of over 5% and margins still north of 17%. 
As for the Corporate segment, turn to the table at the top of Page 7 of the earnings release. Relative to the midpoint of the range we provided at our June IR day, interest expense came in a little lower due to stronger cash flows. Clean energy earning a little higher, I'll add some flavor to that when we get to the CFO Commentary. Acquisition expense a little higher due to the JLT aviation transaction. And in corporate expenses, about  $3 million lower due to 3 items: a onetime refund of some ex-pat taxes; we had an FX adjustment; and a little more tax benefit due to option exercises, each about  $1 million. 
Let's turn out the rest CFO Commentary document like we said that is found on our IR website. Go to Page 2. Relative to the arguments we gave in our June IR day, most of the items pretty much still in line, except for the noncash items: that's amortization and depreciation coming in a touch better. That's simply because we were just a little conservative when we were making our initial estimates on the aviation business that had closed just 12 days earlier on June 1. 
Next, turn to Page 3. Again, we're on the CFO Commentary document. Looking out towards the third and the fourth quarter, our estimates for interest, M&A cost corporate expenses are still consistent with what we provided in June. As for clean energy, while we posted better than our midpoint estimates in the second quarter, we're widening our range for the next couple of quarters. There's 3 reasons for that: we're not seeing the extreme weather like we have last year; 1 host utility had a fire, taking the plant offline for several months; and we are feeling the impact of lower natural gas prices. So there is a lower side scenario leaving us to drop the lower end of the range by about  $5 million. That said, we're still on track to produce over  $200 million of tax credit this year and at June 30, we have nearly  $950 million of carryforward credits. So we are clearly in a terrific position to have very low cash taxes paid well into the mid- to late 2020s.
One operational comment before we get to cash and M&A. You'll see in our earnings release that we took about a $7.2 million or  $0.04 after-tax charge for severance this quarter. We're seeing some real opportunities to bring efficiencies and productivity lift to our back-office support layers. We've started the transformation journey similar to what we did with our middle office layers: centralization standardization, automation and further use of our centers of excellence, all focused on lowering costs and improving quality. The charge we took this quarter is the first step in the transformation journey. I'll have a more detailed update on our September IR day. But needless to say, we are excited about some early views of the opportunity. And finally, as far cash and M&A. At June 30, we have about  $250 million of available cash on our balance sheet. That plus expected free cash flow for the remainder of the year and some more debt should bring our full year M&A capacity to around about  $1.5 billion before using any stock. So okay. Those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter, a truly excellent first half. We're in a great spot for another successful year. Back to you, Pat."

First of all, I think it was 15% of those surveyed said they are seeing rates move in even higher than the 5%. So figure that rates are approaching that 5% number with workers' comp being soft in the meantime. But remember, and I put this in my prepared remarks, our job is to mitigate that. That's what we do for our clients. So if you take a look at our results for the quarter, all-in exposure units and rate contributed about 2% to organic. Now that is up 1 point. Historically, and even through the first quarter, we would've told you it was closer to 1%. So we did get a 1% additional lift from exposures and rate. In terms of accounts moving back and forth between commissions and fees and what that does to the P&L, you'll recall that since 2006, with our friends, the Attorneys Generals, we've been transparent in particular here in the United States, so everybody this buy from us knows exactly what we're making and they can choose to either pay us by fee or they can choose to pay as by commission and a good 80%-plus choose to use the commission vehicle and do allow us to take supplementals and contingents. Of course, supplementals and contingents are very important because they are very profitable. But having the base commissions and fees up about 5.9%, these are benefits then closer to 5, is still good work for the team. So tell me get half of them? About 3% in the first quarter in the first quarter, so we would have -- we didn't survey them, probably rid of some."

With me today is Doug Howell, our CFO; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Today, as we do each quarter, Doug and I are going to report on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; number three, improving our productivity and quality; and number four, maintaining our unique culture. Once again, the team delivered on all 4 of our strategic priorities, and I couldn't be more pleased. We really do have some terrific momentum.
Let me give you some second quarter financial highlights for our combined core Brokerage and Risk Management segments: 12% growth in revenues, 5.3% all-in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 49 basis points and we completed 13 mergers with about $195 million of estimated annualized revenues. Just another outstanding quarter for the team. Let me break down our results by segment.
Our Brokerage segment second quarter organic was 5.8% all-in. There was some geography change between base and supplementals in the quarter, so think of base organic more like 5.9% and organic for contingents and supplementals combined of about 4.5%, a really nice quarter.
All of our divisions globally contributed. Our domestic retail brokerage operations had a great quarter with organic of about 5%. PC operations were slightly better than that, and our benefits operations a bit below. Our U.S. wholesale and program business had an excellent base organic quarter, posting more than 5% with contingents and supplemental revenue growth above that. Internationally, our brokerage operations combined to post about 8% organic on very broad-based strength in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Just fantastic results wherever I look in our business.
Moving on to the rate environment. Our internal data and our internal midyear rate survey are indicating a trend of increasing property/casualty pricing. Almost 75% of our producers surveyed indicated rates increase during the second quarter renewals, [indiscernible] approaching about 5% with international a bit higher and domestic a bit below that. What caught my attention though is that about 15% of our surveyed producers indicated they were seeing rates of more than 10%, very few indicated that level of increase last year.
Let me give you some more detail by geography. 
I'll start in the U.S. Rate overall is up about 4% in our retail operations, with the greatest increases across commercial auto, property and umbrella. Most other casualty lines are flat to up a few points, while workers' compensation rates remain a negative territory, down about 3%. Staying in the U.S., [indiscernible] rate within our wholesale operations RPS is up 5% to 6%, with price increases in low double digits for many property-related lines, especially on large or loss-impacted accounts. Additionally, medical malpractice, general liability and umbrella are experiencing average price increases of about 5%, while comp, casualty and some professional lines are closer to flat.
Let me move to the U.K. Overall pricing is up about 5%. However, a different environment in retail and our specialty operations. U.K. retail pricing is up about 3%, while pricing is increasing in our U.K. wholesale operations by almost 8%. Here it seemed to be pushing for more rate in casualty-oriented lines, such as D&O and E&O and general liability, in addition to the property.
In Canada, pricing is up 4.5% with property, auto and medical malpractice rate increases in the high single digits. Most other casualty lines are closer to flat.
And finally, in Australia and New Zealand, pricing is up around 7%, which is very similar to what we have been seeing for the past 2 years.
So to sum it up, around the world, property/casualty rates are up close to 5%, and exposures are still growing. This is when we excel. Our talented production staff is fully engaged helping clients and prospects mitigate the challenges of an increasing rate environment.
Next let me talk about Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 13 Brokerage acquisitions, which should add about  $195 million of estimated annualized revenue. I was in the U.K. just 3 weeks ago and was able to meet with our new Stackhouse Poland and aerospace colleagues. I couldn't be more excited about them joining our team. Together, these 2 mergers account for about 75% of acquired revenues this quarter and give us a top-notch U.K. high net worth business and make us an industry leader in aerospace brokerage overnight. The other 11 mergers average about $5 million in annual revenues, which is more consistent with our historical tuck-in merger and acquisition strategy. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
As I look at our merger and acquisition pipeline, I see more than $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed upon or being prepared. None of these 50 brokerage mergers have more than  $40 million of annual revenues. We know that not all these transactions will close, but it illustrates our pipeline is still very strong and full of small tuck-in opportunities run by entrepreneurs with excellent sales skills and client relationships.
Next I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Second quarter organic growth was 3%, in line with the estimate we provided at our Investor Day in June. Recall, we posted over 10% last year in the second quarter, so it made for a difficult comparison this year, but still very respectable. In the U.S., claim counts are increasing year-over-year as our clients' businesses grow. Call claim counts up about 2%. Our expanded specialty offerings are generating encouraging new business leads and wins, while our insurance carrier business continues its positive momentum. In fact, last year alone, we paid out claims totaling over  $1.5 billion on behalf of our insurance carrier clients. Growth in these areas has been driven by investments in analytics and innovative technologies that are delivering positive claim outcomes for our clients.
Outside the U.S., growth was strong in the U.K. while Australia was weaker due to lower performance bonus fees, which can be lumpy from year to year. Looking forward, we are expecting stronger organic growth in the second half of 2019 due to some new client wins, and we think organic for the full year should be in the mid-single digit range.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on Gallagher's unique culture. Our culture is really about our colleagues and the rock-solid foundation they form based on every interaction we have with clients, with underwriters and with each other across divisions and around the world. Our culture makes our franchise distinctive, and it's why we are constantly looking for the right people to join us whether through new hires, mergers and acquisitions or internship program. Next month, we will conclude our 54th year of the Gallagher Summer Internship Program. This rigorous 2-month program for nearly 500 young men and women is an essential investment in our future to ensure our unique culture thrives for many years to come.
Okay, a great first half, which bodes well for another excellent year. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"
252186,629072030,1780034,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J.

As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top and bottom line results. Combining with a terrific first quarter, it puts us in a great spot halfway through the year. Today, I'll amplify a few comments that Pat made from the earnings release. I'll move to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our website, and then I'll conclude with my usual comments on cash and M&A.
All right. To the Brokerage segment, organic growth on Page 3 of the earnings release. A great quarter at upper 5%, nearly 6%. As we look forward, we see it more like 5% than 6% as we had a really strong third quarter last year, so that creates a tough compare this year. As for Brokerage margin, for the quarter, we delivered about 50 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Looking forward, that seems about right in this environment. Organic up 5% should yield about 50 basis points. 
Risk Management. We posted 3% organic growth and 17.5% adjusted margins this quarter. That's right in line with what we forecasted at our June IR day and great performance by the team, especially considering the second quarter 2018. As Pat said, we posted over 10% organic and 17.6% in adjusted margins. 
Looking towards the second half, at our Risk Management segment, we're seeing organic over 5% and margins still north of 17%.
As for the Corporate segment, turn to the table at the top of Page 7 of the earnings release. Relative to the midpoint of the range we provided at our June IR day, interest expense came in a little lower due to stronger cash flows; clean energy earnings, a little higher, I'll add some flavor to that when we get to the CFO Commentary; acquisition expense, a little higher due to the JLT aviation transaction. And in corporate expenses, about  $3 million lower due to 3 items, a onetime refund of some ex-pact taxes, we had an FX adjustment and a little more tax benefit due to option exercises, each about  $1 million.
Let's turn now to the CFO Commentary document like we said that's found on our IR website. Go to Page 2. Relative to the ultimates we gave at our June IR day, most of the items pretty much still in line, except for the noncash items that's amortization and depreciation coming in a touch better. That's simply because we were just a little conservative when we were making our initial estimates on the aviation business that had closed just 12 days earlier on June 1.
Next turn to Page 3. Again, we're on the CFO Commentary document. Looking out towards the third and the fourth quarter, our estimates for interest, M&A cost and corporate expenses are still consistent with what we provided in June. As for clean energy, while we posted better than our midpoint estimates in the second quarter, we're widening our range for the next couple of quarters. There's 3 reasons for that: we're not seeing the extreme weather like we have last year; one host utility had a fire, taking the plant offline for several months; and we are feeling the impact of lower natural gas prices. So there is a lower-side scenario, leaving us to drop to lower end of the range by about  $5 million. That said, we're still on track to produce over  $200 million of tax credit this year. And at June 30, we have nearly  $950 million of carryforward credits. So we are clearly in a terrific position to have very low cash taxes paid well into the mid- to late 2020s.
One operational comment before we get to cash and M&A. You'll see in our earnings release that we took about a $7.2 million or  $0.04 after-tax charge for severance this quarter. We're seeing some real opportunities to bring efficiencies and productivity lift to our back-office support layers. We've started a transformation journey similar to what we did with our middle office layers: centralization standardization, automation and further use of our centers of excellence, all focused on lowering costs and improving quality. The charge we took this quarter is the first step in that transformation journey. I'll have a more detailed update at our September IR day. But needless to say, we are excited about some early views of the opportunity.
And finally, as far cash and M&A. At June 30, we have about  $250 million of available cash on our balance sheet. That plus expected free cash flow for the remainder of the year and some more debt should bring our full year M&A capacity to around about $1.5 billion before using any stock.
So okay. Those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter, a truly excellent first half. We're in a great spot for another successful year. Back to you, Pat."

Well, that's a lot of questions, Mike. Let me jump in and try and get through them and do my best. First of all, I think it was 15% of those surveyed who said they are seeing rates move even higher than the 5%. So figure that rates are approaching that 5% number with workers' comp being soft in the meantime. But remember, and I put this in my prepared remarks, our job is to mitigate that. That's what we do for our clients. So if you take a look at our results for the quarter, all-in exposure units and rate contributed about 2% to organic. Now that is up 1 point. Historically, and even through the first quarter, we would've told you it was closer to 1%. So we did get a 1% additional lift from exposures and rate. In terms of accounts moving back and forth between commissions and fees and what that does to the P&L, you'll recall that since 2006, with our friends, the Attorneys Generals, we've been transparent, in particular here in the United States, so everybody that's buying from us knows exactly what we're making, and they can choose to either pay us by fee, or they can choose to pay us by commission. And a good 80%-plus choose to use the commission vehicle and do allow us to take supplementals and contingents. Of course, supplementals and contingents are very important because they are very profitable. But having the base commissions and fees up about 5.9%, [indiscernible] benefits then closer to 5% is still good work for the team. So tell me did I get half of them?"

With me today is Doug Howell, our CFO; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Today, as we do each quarter, Doug and I are going to report on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; number three, improving our productivity and quality; and number four, maintaining our unique culture. Once again, the team delivered on all 4 of our strategic priorities, and I couldn't be more pleased. We really do have some terrific momentum.
Let me give you some second quarter financial highlights for our combined core Brokerage and Risk Management segments: 12% growth in revenues, 5.3% all-in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 49 basis points and we completed 13 mergers with about $195 million of estimated annualized revenues. Just another outstanding quarter for the team. Let me break down our results by segment.
Our Brokerage segment second quarter organic was 5.8% all-in. There was some geography change between base and supplementals in the quarter, so think of base organic more like 5.9% and organic for contingents and supplementals combined of about 4.5%, a really nice quarter.
All of our divisions globally contributed. Our domestic retail brokerage operations had a great quarter with organic of about 5%. PC operations were slightly better than that, and our benefits operations a bit below. Our U.S. wholesale and program business had an excellent base organic quarter, posting more than 5% with contingents and supplemental revenue growth above that. Internationally, our brokerage operations combined to post about 8% organic on very broad-based strength in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Just fantastic results wherever I look in our business.
Moving on to the rate environment. Our internal data and our internal midyear rate survey are indicating a trend of increasing property/casualty pricing. Almost 75% of our producers surveyed indicated rates increase during the second quarter renewals, [ calling it ] approaching about 5% with international a bit higher and domestic a bit below that. What caught my attention though is that about 15% of our surveyed producers indicated they were seeing rates up more than 10%, very few indicated that level of increase last year.
Let me give you some more detail by geography. 
I'll start in the U.S. Rate overall is up about 4% in our retail operations, with the greatest increases across commercial auto, property and umbrella. Most other casualty lines are flat to up a few points, while workers' compensation rates remain in negative territory, down about 3%. Staying in the U.S., pure rate within our wholesale operations RPS is up 5% to 6%, with price increases in low double digits for many property-related lines, especially on large or loss-impacted accounts. Additionally, medical malpractice, general liability and umbrella are experiencing average price increases of about 5%, while comp, casualty and some professional lines are closer to flat.
Let me move to the U.K. Overall pricing is up about 5%. However, a different environment in retail and our specialty operations. U.K. retail pricing is up about 3%, while pricing is increasing in our U.K. wholesale operations by almost 8%. Here it seemed to be pushing for more rate in casualty-oriented lines, such as D&O and E&O and general liability, in addition to the property.
In Canada, pricing is up 4.5% with property, auto and medical malpractice rate increases in the high single digits. Most other casualty lines are closer to flat.
And finally, in Australia and New Zealand, pricing is up around 7%, which is very similar to what we have been seeing for the past 2 years.
So to sum it up, around the world, property/casualty rates are up close to 5%, and exposures are still growing. This is when we excel. Our talented production staff is fully engaged helping clients and prospects mitigate the challenges of an increasing rate environment.
Next let me talk about Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 13 Brokerage acquisitions, which should add about  $195 million of estimated annualized revenue. I was in the U.K. just 3 weeks ago and was able to meet with our new Stackhouse Poland and aerospace colleagues. I couldn't be more excited about them joining our team. Together, these 2 mergers account for about 75% of acquired revenues this quarter and give us a top-notch U.K. high net worth business and make us an industry leader in aerospace brokerage overnight. The other 11 mergers average about $5 million in annual revenues, which is more consistent with our historical tuck-in merger and acquisition strategy. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
As I look at our merger and acquisition pipeline, I see more than $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed upon or being prepared. None of these 50 brokerage mergers have more than  $40 million of annual revenues. We know that not all these transactions will close, but it illustrates our pipeline is still very strong and full of small tuck-in opportunities run by entrepreneurs with excellent sales skills and client relationships.
Next I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Second quarter organic growth was 3%, in line with the estimate we provided at our Investor Day in June. Recall, we posted over 10% last year in the second quarter, so it made for a difficult comparison this year, but still very respectable. In the U.S., claim counts are increasing year-over-year as our clients' businesses grow. Call claim counts up about 2%. Our expanded specialty offerings are generating encouraging new business leads and wins, while our insurance carrier business continues its positive momentum. In fact, last year alone, we paid out claims totaling over  $1.5 billion on behalf of our insurance carrier clients. Growth in these areas has been driven by investments in analytics and innovative technologies that are delivering positive claim outcomes for our clients.
Outside the U.S., growth was strong in the U.K. while Australia was weaker due to lower performance bonus fees, which can be lumpy from year to year. Looking forward, we are expecting stronger organic growth in the second half of 2019 due to some new client wins, and we think organic for the full year should be in the mid-single digit range.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on Gallagher's unique culture. Our culture is really about our colleagues and the rock-solid foundation they form based on every interaction we have with clients, with underwriters and with each other across divisions and around the world. Our culture makes our franchise distinctive, and it's why we are constantly looking for the right people to join us whether through new hires, mergers and acquisitions or internship program. Next month, we will conclude our 54th year of the Gallagher Summer Internship Program. This rigorous 2-month program for nearly 500 young men and women is an essential investment in our future to ensure our unique culture thrives for many years to come.
Okay, a great first half, which bodes well for another excellent year. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top and bottom line results. Combining with a terrific first quarter, it puts us in a great spot halfway through the year. Today, I'll amplify a few comments that Pat made from the earnings release. I'll move to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our website, and then I'll conclude with my usual comments on cash and M&A.
All right. To the Brokerage segment, organic growth on Page 3 of the earnings release. A great quarter at upper 5%, nearly 6%. As we look forward, we see it more like 5% than 6% as we had a really strong third quarter last year, so that creates a tough compare this year. As for Brokerage margin, for the quarter, we delivered about 50 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Looking forward, that seems about right in this environment. Organic up 5% should yield about 50 basis points. 
Risk Management. We posted 3% organic growth and 17.5% adjusted margins this quarter. That's right in line with what we forecasted at our June IR day and great performance by the team, especially considering the second quarter 2018. As Pat said, we posted over 10% organic and 17.6% in adjusted margins. 
Looking towards the second half, at our Risk Management segment, we're seeing organic over 5% and margins still north of 17%.
As for the Corporate segment, turn to the table at the top of Page 7 of the earnings release. Relative to the midpoint of the range we provided at our June IR day, interest expense came in a little lower due to stronger cash flows; clean energy earnings, a little higher, I'll add some flavor to that when we get to the CFO Commentary; acquisition expense, a little higher due to the JLT aviation transaction. And in corporate expenses, about  $3 million lower due to 3 items, a onetime refund of some expat taxes, we had an FX adjustment and a little more tax benefit due to option exercises, each about  $1 million.
Let's turn now to the CFO Commentary document like we said that's found on our IR website. Go to Page 2. Relative to the estimates we gave at our June IR day, most of the items pretty much still in line, except for the noncash items that's amortization and depreciation coming in a touch better. That's simply because we were just a little conservative when we were making our initial estimates on the aviation business that had closed just 12 days earlier on June 1.
Next turn to Page 3. Again, we're on the CFO Commentary document. Looking out towards the third and the fourth quarter, our estimates for interest, M&A cost and corporate expenses are still consistent with what we provided in June. As for clean energy, while we posted better than our midpoint estimates in the second quarter, we're widening our range for the next couple of quarters. There's 3 reasons for that: we're not seeing the extreme weather like we have last year; one host utility had a fire, taking the plant offline for several months; and we are feeling the impact of lower natural gas prices. So there is a lower-side scenario, leading us to drop the lower end of the range by about  $5 million. That said, we're still on track to produce over  $200 million of tax credit this year. And at June 30, we have nearly  $950 million of carryforward credits. So we are clearly in a terrific position to have very low cash taxes paid well into the mid- to late 2020s.
One operational comment before we get to cash and M&A. You'll see in our earnings release that we took about a $7.2 million or  $0.04 after-tax charge for severance this quarter. We're seeing some real opportunities to bring efficiencies and productivity lift to our back-office support layers. We've started a transformation journey similar to what we did with our middle office layers: centralization standardization, automation and further use of our centers of excellence, all focused on lowering costs and improving quality. The charge we took this quarter is the first step in that transformation journey. I'll have a more detailed update at our September IR day. But needless to say, we are excited about some early views of the opportunity.
And finally, as far cash and M&A. At June 30, we have about  $250 million of available cash on our balance sheet. That plus expected free cash flow for the remainder of the year and some more debt should bring our full year M&A capacity to around about $1.5 billion before using any stock.
So okay. Those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter, a truly excellent first half. We're in a great spot for another successful year. Back to you, Pat."

Well, that's a lot of questions, Mike. Let me jump in and try and get through them and do my best. First of all, I think it was 15% of those surveyed who said they are seeing rates move even higher than the 5%. So figure that rates are approaching that 5% number with workers' comp being soft in the meantime. But remember, and I put this in my prepared remarks, our job is to mitigate that. That's what we do for our clients. So if you take a look at our results for the quarter, all-in exposure units and rate contributed about 2% to organic. Now that is up 1 point. Historically, and even through the first quarter, we would've told you it was closer to 1%. So we did get a 1% additional lift from exposures and rate. In terms of accounts moving back and forth between commissions and fees and what that does to the P&L, you'll recall that since 2006, with our friends, the Attorneys Generals, we've been transparent, in particular here in the United States, so everybody that's buying from us knows exactly what we're making, and they can choose to either pay us by fee, or they can choose to pay us by commission. And a good 80%-plus choose to use the commission vehicle and do allow us to take supplementals and contingents. Of course, supplementals and contingents are very important because they are very profitable. But having the base commissions and fees up about 5.9%, [ if we saw ] benefits then closer to 5% is still good work for the team. So tell me did I get half of them?"

The difference between a private transaction to perpetuate your agency. Remember, most of our acquisitions are small, $5 million, $6 million,  $7 million, $8 million. And what you can get by selling to a strategic is getting to be like a 50% differential, which is taking owners and saying, ""Really, if I'm going to perpetuate to my younger teammates, I'm going to take a 50% cut, a haircut? I don't think so."" So I think that's bringing a lot more potential sellers to the table. And prices are up as well. And I think the advisers out there are saying, ""Look, we haven't seen multiples at this height, especially for a large deal, in a long, long time."" The banks did this 20 years ago. But you might want to move while the opportunity is there, which is, again, good for us. That makes our pipeline longer. We can be very discerning. We only want -- look, 90% of our due diligence is on culture. We only want people that are going to fit from day 1. And we got lots of opportunities to look."

I think we can do $1.5 billion of deals this year without issuing stock, but I don't think that we would hesitate to use a little stock in an acquisition. If we get down to the end of the year, we need to do a $100 million or $200 million of stock. Or at first quarter next year, we'll probably do that. I mean, if you're still buying in that 8x range on the smaller deals, then we would issue some shares directly to the sellers. I think that's still good value creation.

With me today is Doug Howell, our CFO; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Today, as we do each quarter, Doug and I are going to report on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value: number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; number three, improving our productivity and quality; and number four, maintaining our unique culture. Once again, the team delivered on all 4 of our strategic priorities, and I couldn't be more pleased. We really do have some terrific momentum.
Let me give you some second quarter financial highlights for our combined core Brokerage and Risk Management segments: 12% growth in revenues, 5.3% all-in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 49 basis points and we completed 13 mergers with about $195 million of estimated annualized revenues. Just another outstanding quarter for the team. Let me break down our results by segment.
Our Brokerage segment second quarter organic was 5.8% all-in. There was some geography change between base and supplementals in the quarter, so think of base organic more like 5.9% and organic for contingents and supplementals combined of about 4.5%, a really nice quarter.
All of our divisions globally contributed. Our domestic retail brokerage operations had a great quarter with organic of about 5%. PC operations were slightly better than that, and our benefits operations a bit below. Our U.S. wholesale and program business had an excellent base organic quarter, posting more than 5% with contingents and supplemental revenue growth above that. Internationally, our brokerage operations combined to post about 8% organic on very broad-based strength in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Just fantastic results wherever I look in our business.
Moving on to the rate environment. Our internal data and our internal midyear rate survey are indicating a trend of increasing property/casualty pricing. Almost 75% of our producers surveyed indicated rates increase during the second quarter renewals, [ calling it ] approaching about 5% with international a bit higher and domestic a bit below that. What caught my attention though is that about 15% of our surveyed producers indicated they were seeing rates up more than 10%, very few indicated that level of increase last year.
Let me give you some more detail by geography. 
I'll start in the U.S. Rate overall is up about 4% in our retail operations, with the greatest increases across commercial auto, property and umbrella. Most other casualty lines are flat to up a few points, while workers' compensation rates remain in negative territory, down about 3%. Staying in the U.S., pure rate within our wholesale operations RPS is up 5% to 6%, with price increases in low double digits for many property-related lines, especially on large or loss-impacted accounts. Additionally, medical malpractice, general liability and umbrella are experiencing average price increases of about 5%, while comp, casualty and some professional lines are closer to flat.
Let me move to the U.K. Overall pricing is up about 5%. However, a different environment in retail and our specialty operations. U.K. retail pricing is up about 3%, while pricing is increasing in our U.K. wholesale operations by almost 8%. Here it seemed to be pushing for more rate in casualty-oriented lines, such as D&O and E&O and general liability, in addition to the property.
In Canada, pricing is up 4.5% with property, auto and medical malpractice rate increases in the high single digits. Most other casualty lines are closer to flat.
And finally, in Australia and New Zealand, pricing is up around 7%, which is very similar to what we have been seeing for the past 2 years.
So to sum it up, around the world, property/casualty rates are up close to 5%, and exposures are still growing. This is when we excel. Our talented production staff is fully engaged helping clients and prospects mitigate the challenges of an increasing rate environment.
Next let me talk about Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 13 Brokerage acquisitions, which should add about  $195 million of estimated annualized revenue. I was in the U.K. just 3 weeks ago and was able to meet with our new Stackhouse Poland and aerospace colleagues. I couldn't be more excited about them joining our team. Together, these 2 mergers account for about 75% of acquired revenues this quarter and give us a top-notch U.K. high net worth business and make us an industry leader in aerospace brokerage overnight. The other 11 mergers average about $5 million in annual revenues, which is more consistent with our historical tuck-in merger and acquisition strategy. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
As I look at our merger and acquisition pipeline, I see more than $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed upon or being prepared. None of these 50 brokerage mergers have more than  $40 million of annual revenues. We know that not all these transactions will close, but it illustrates our pipeline is still very strong and full of small tuck-in opportunities run by entrepreneurs with excellent sales skills and client relationships.
Next I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Second quarter organic growth was 3%, in line with the estimate we provided at our Investor Day in June. Recall, we posted over 10% last year in the second quarter, so it made for a difficult comparison this year, but still very respectable. In the U.S., claim counts are increasing year-over-year as our clients' businesses grow. Call claim counts up about 2%. Our expanded specialty offerings are generating encouraging new business leads and wins, while our insurance carrier business continues its positive momentum. In fact, last year alone, we paid out claims totaling over  $1.5 billion on behalf of our insurance carrier clients. Growth in these areas has been driven by investments in analytics and innovative technologies that are delivering positive claim outcomes for our clients.
Outside the U.S., growth was strong in the U.K. while Australia was weaker due to lower performance bonus fees, which can be lumpy from year to year. Looking forward, we are expecting stronger organic growth in the second half of 2019 due to some new client wins, and we think organic for the full year should be in the mid-single-digit range.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on Gallagher's unique culture. Our culture is really about our colleagues and the rock-solid foundation they form based on every interaction we have with clients, with underwriters and with each other across divisions and around the world. Our culture makes our franchise distinctive, and it's why we are constantly looking for the right people to join us whether through new hires, mergers and acquisitions or internship program. Next month, we will conclude our 54th year of the Gallagher Summer Internship Program. This rigorous 2-month program for nearly 500 young men and women is an essential investment in our future to ensure our unique culture thrives for many years to come.
Okay, a great first half, which bodes well for another excellent year. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"
252186,629072030,1781297,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J.

As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top and bottom line results. Combining with a terrific first quarter, it puts us in a great spot halfway through the year. Today, I'll amplify a few comments that Pat made from the earnings release. I'll move to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our website, and then I'll conclude with my usual comments on cash and M&A.
All right. To the Brokerage segment, organic growth on Page 3 of the earnings release. A great quarter at upper 5%, nearly 6%. As we look forward, we see it more like 5% than 6% as we had a really strong third quarter last year, so that creates a tough compare this year. As for Brokerage margin, for the quarter, we delivered about 50 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Looking forward, that seems about right in this environment. Organic up 5% should yield about 50 basis points. 
Risk Management. We posted 3% organic growth and 17.5% adjusted margins this quarter. That's right in line with what we forecasted at our June IR day and great performance by the team, especially considering the second quarter 2018. As Pat said, we posted over 10% organic and 17.6% in adjusted margins. 
Looking towards the second half, at our Risk Management segment, we're seeing organic over 5% and margins still north of 17%.
As for the Corporate segment, turn to the table at the top of Page 7 of the earnings release. Relative to the midpoint of the range we provided at our June IR day, interest expense came in a little lower due to stronger cash flows; clean energy earnings, a little higher, I'll add some flavor to that when we get to the CFO Commentary; acquisition expense, a little higher due to the JLT aviation transaction. And in corporate expenses, about  $3 million lower due to 3 items, a onetime refund of some expat taxes, we had an FX adjustment and a little more tax benefit due to option exercises, each about  $1 million.
Let's turn now to the CFO Commentary document like we said that's found on our IR website. Go to Page 2. Relative to the estimates we gave at our June IR day, most of the items pretty much still in line, except for the noncash items that's amortization and depreciation coming in a touch better. That's simply because we were just a little conservative when we were making our initial estimates on the aviation business that had closed just 12 days earlier on June 1.
Next turn to Page 3. Again, we're on the CFO Commentary document. Looking out towards the third and the fourth quarter, our estimates for interest, M&A cost and corporate expenses are still consistent with what we provided in June. As for clean energy, while we posted better than our midpoint estimates in the second quarter, we're widening our range for the next couple of quarters. There's 3 reasons for that: we're not seeing the extreme weather like we have last year; one host utility had a fire, taking the plant offline for several months; and we are feeling the impact of lower natural gas prices. So there is a lower-side scenario, leading us to drop the lower end of the range by about  $5 million. That said, we're still on track to produce over  $200 million of tax credit this year. And at June 30, we have nearly  $950 million of carryforward credits. So we are clearly in a terrific position to have very low cash taxes paid well into the mid- to late 2020s.
One operational comment before we get to cash and M&A. You'll see in our earnings release that we took about a $7.2 million or  $0.04 after-tax charge for severance this quarter. We're seeing some real opportunities to bring efficiencies and productivity lift to our back-office support layers. We've started a transformation journey similar to what we did with our middle office layers: centralization standardization, automation and further use of our centers of excellence, all focused on lowering costs and improving quality. The charge we took this quarter is the first step in that transformation journey. I'll have a more detailed update at our September IR day. But needless to say, we are excited about some early views of the opportunity.
And finally, as far cash and M&A. At June 30, we have about  $250 million of available cash on our balance sheet. That plus expected free cash flow for the remainder of the year and some more debt should bring our full year M&A capacity to around about $1.5 billion before using any stock.
So okay. Those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter, a truly excellent first half. We're in a great spot for another successful year. Back to you, Pat."

Well, that's a lot of questions, Mike. Let me jump in and try and get through them and do my best.

Well, that's a lot of questions, Mike. Let me jump in and try and get through them and do my best. First of all, I think it was 15% of those surveyed who said they are seeing rates move even higher than the 5%. So figure that rates are approaching that 5% number with workers' comp being soft in the meantime. But remember, and I put this in my prepared remarks, our job is to mitigate that. That's what we do for our clients. So if you take a look at our results for the quarter, all-in exposure units and rate contributed about 2% to organic. Now that is up 1 point. Historically, and even through the first quarter, we would've told you it was closer to 1%. So we did get a 1% additional lift from exposures and rate. In terms of accounts moving back and forth between commissions and fees and what that does to the P&L, you'll recall that since 2006, with our friends, the Attorneys Generals, we've been transparent, in particular here in the United States, so everybody that's buying from us knows exactly what we're making, and they can choose to either pay us by fee, or they can choose to pay us by commission. And a good 80%-plus choose to use the commission vehicle and do allow us to take supplementals and contingents. Of course, supplementals and contingents are very important because they are very profitable. But having the base commissions and fees up about 5.9%, [ if we saw ] benefits then closer to 5% is still good work for the team. So tell me did I get half of them?"

The second half of your question is in terms of the opportunity for us to take a little severance this quarter and maybe restructure some of our positions. That does show us an opportunity, but it's more of a long-term play, Elyse. I think we got raises coming up in the second half of the year, so that will help that.

So what suggestions do you have? Now in some instances, there's not much you can do, which is why some of it will flow through and why we see about 2% hitting the books right now. There's not much if you've got already a very high deductible for property and the property is going to go up 7% or 8%. You're not going to get much savings taking your deductible up another $100,000. It's the bigger part of the exposure that they want the rate at, and they're going to get it. These -- I can't give you a percentage of which of our clients drop cover, but we do keep -- we do try to keep an eye on terms and cost. And by and large, our people are doing a really good job of, number one, getting out and explaining that the pricing dynamic is a little bit different; and number two, I'll be back to you with suggestions."

I don't think so."" So I think that's bringing a lot more potential sellers to the table. And prices are up as well. And I think the advisers out there are saying, ""Look, we haven't seen multiples at this height, especially for a large deal, in a long, long time."" The banks did this 20 years ago.

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Let me just start by saying we had another e",1116,"Thank you, Devon. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
Let me just start by saying we had another excellent quarter. Our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments delivered 13% growth in revenues, 5.8% all-in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 66 basis points and we completed 14 merges with about $85 million of estimated annualized revenues, just a terrific quarter by the team. 
Today, Doug and I are going to spend our time focused on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. First, organic growth. I'll review organic by geography, comment on the pricing environment and give you some insight regarding exposures; second, going through mergers and acquisitions; third, productivity and quality, Doug will hit this topic after my remarks; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture. 
Okay, to organic. Let me start with the Brokerage segment. Third quarter organic was 5.8% all-in, which is similar to our organic performance through the first 6 months of 2019. I'm very pleased that all of our divisions globally contributed to this result. For example, our domestic retail PC operations had another strong quarter, with organic of about 5%. Our wholesale operations had an excellent quarter, posting about 6.5% organic. This includes over 10% in our domestic open brokerage applications. Our benefits operation also has a strong showing this quarter, posting base organic of about 4.5%. And then internationally, our retail brokerage operations combined to post 7% organic, with Canada more than 10%; Australia and New Zealand up about 6%; and the U.K., up 5%. Another really strong quarter of production by the team. 
Let me move to the rate environment. We've been hearing a consistent message, whether it's from our carrier partners at the CIB and the WSIA conferences or from our global leaders during our strategic planning sessions. Rates continue to increase across nearly all areas of the market. Our own internal data also points to increasing PC rate environment, with global PC pricing up about 5%, which is a bit stronger than what we saw in our midyear internal pricing survey. Let me break out what we are seeing. I'll start in the U.S. Rate overall is up around 5% in our retail operations, with workers' compensation all-in line not showing incremental pricing strength relative to the second quarter. Within our domestic wholesale brokerage operations, pricing is approaching 6%. Moving to the U.K. U.K. retail pricing is up over 3%, a touch higher than the second quarter. And the U.K. wholesale operations pricing is approaching double digits across many lines. In Canada, pricing is up around 8%, with property increases more than 10%. And finally in Australia and New Zealand, pricing is up around 5% to 6%, about a point lower than what we have been seeing over the previous 2 years, but still a substantial increase. 
Moving to exposures. In early October, we surveyed our producers specifically asking questions related to their clients' payroll and exposure units. Over 75% said their customers payrolls and exposure units grew during the third quarter. And more than 95% of these respondents said they were seeing similar or stronger client exposure growth as they begin working on 2020 renewals. This is consistent with the results from our May 2019 benefits benchmarking survey, where more than 70% of the 3,900 employers believe that their revenue would be increasing over the next 2 years. 
So when I look around the world, PC rates and exposures continue to move higher. This is an environment, in which our talented production staff excels by delivering the best insurance Risk Management and benefits consulting advice, by leveraging our vast array of resources and capabilities. As I sit here today, I see our fourth quarter organic nicely in the mid-5% range. 
Next, let me talk about our Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 11 tuck-in brokerage acquisitions, with estimated annualized revenue of $70 million. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing family of professionals. The Brokerage team has had a very busy M&A year completing 35 mergers, with more than $330 million of annualized revenues during the first 9 months. Adding to that, we have already announced a number of mergers in October, which should add an additional $90 million of annualized revenue. This is on top of our M&A pipeline report that shows $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed-upon or being prepared. While not all these transaction in the pipeline will ultimately close, as I look around the world, it's clear that our tuck-in merger opportunities remain very robust. 
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Third quarter organic growth was 5.7%, with similar results in both our U.S. and international operations. The growth we are experiencing is also broad-based by client type, including large commercial, public sector, alternative markets and insurance carrier clients. Our investments in innovative products, like the award-winning mobile app GB Go, combined with expertise by product and industry continued to set Gallagher Bassett apart from the competition. Looking forward, we see mid-single-digit organic growth in the fourth quarter. In terms of mergers and acquisitions, we completed 3 Risk Management acquisitions this quarter at an annualized revenue of about $15 million. These acquisitions provide us with incremental capabilities and services that will benefit our clients in Australia, the U.K., Europe, and the U.S. I'd like to extend a very warm welcome to our new Gallagher Bassett professionals. 
Lastly, I'd like to touch on the true competitive advantage that's Gallagher's unique culture. It is a culture that helps us attract and retain the very best talent, a culture that promotes our relationships with our carrier partners, a culture that distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment, and it's the basis for people coming together as a team to service clients, focused in doing the right thing. Nowadays, we're hearing a lot about company culture and purpose. This is nothing new to Gallagher. We've long valued all of our stakeholders as defined in our mission statement. Ultimately, we believe that we provide value to our clients, take care of our employees and build strong relationships with our insurance carrier partners, our shareholders will be rewarded. Bottom line, our culture always has been and will continue to be a true competitive advantage. 
Okay. A great quarter and first 9 months, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

I'd like to start by thanking the theme for another outstanding quarter. It really does position us very well to close out an outstanding 2019 here in the fourth quarter. 
Today, I'll make a few comments from the earnings release. I'll walk you then through the CFO Commentary document we've posted on our website, and I'll conclude with some comments in cash and M&A. 
Okay. Let's go to the bottom of Page 5 of the earnings release, with the Brokerage segment margins. For the quarter, we delivered 68 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That's terrific results at 5.8% organic growth, and this marks the 32nd straight quarter of Brokerage segment margin expansion, a truly amazing run and an excellent illustration of how we're constantly focusing on raising our quality and productivity. Looking forward, we would expect to see about 50 basis points of margin expansion if organic growth is in the low- to mid-5% range. 
Let's flip to Page 6 of the earnings release to the Risk Management segment margins. During the quarter, we posted 18 points of adjusted EBITDAC margin. That's really great work by the team, but well above the upper end of our targets. So we wouldn't expect to see that in the fourth quarter. Perhaps more like 17% to 17.5%, which will finish off the year nicely towards the higher end of our full year target, also in that 17% to 17.5% range. Let's now move to the CFO Commentary document that we can find on our website. Let's turn to page 2. Relative to third quarter estimates that we provided during our September IR day, nearly all of the lines came in very close. A few other comments. First, our integration efforts. Mostly related to the aerospace and Stackhouse mergers we did this summer. Further moving along on plan and on budget. Second, we're making nice progress on our back office support layer transformation project we discussed at our IR day. We've already contracted a few hundred positions and we have a nice line of sight in the areas where we can lower our cost and improve our service quality by centralization, standardization and automation of most of our back office functions. We'll redeploy the savings into prophecies to help us drive our organic growth. Sales support and sales management with the tools, data and sales analytics, additional production talent, marketing and branding. In other words, all our effort to allow to sell more, hire more and acquire more. 
And finally, still in Page 2, I'll make note. Please make sure your models are picking up our estimates for changes in estimated announce and also earnings from noncontrolling interests. Neither are big numbers but still can move your estimates by $0.01 or $0.02. We'll stay in the CFO commentary document but flip the Page 3 to the corporate segment. Relative to the estimates we provided during our September IR day, interest in corporate expense lines were both within the range. Acquisition expense was just at that show your, mostly due to a couple small international deals. And then finally, the clean energy. You'll see that the third quarter adjusted results came in a couple million dollars above the midpoint of the range, a great quarter. Looking forward, fourth quarter is looking a bit lower than what we were seeing during our IR day. Weather thus far in October is not nearly as hot as last year. So we moderated our fourth quarter outlook just a bit. That said, it's stacking up to be another $100 million a year for this investment strategy. 
We also see a clean energy adjustment line this quarter. The clean energy had a very existing quarter. Footnote to describe these 4 items. We've resolved a 5-year patent squabble with a great outcome. We prevailed in Tax Court, we opened the new patent defense litigation which I think is an American but we did the finding and rigorously. And finally we're making terrific progress in moving our 3 of our 2011-era lower production machines into a really great 2009-era locations. You can see this clearly on Page 4, the CFO Commentary -- in the fourth quarter of that page. Shows the machines are currently producing less than $1 million of earnings here in 2019 but by moving them, we can achieve $10 million to $15 million of earnings. Hats off to those engineers and operators that we used to make this happen. Really a great job. There's also affirmation from our utility partners who truly have an excellent process and that we're delivering substantial environmental benefits. 
We'll stand at Page 4. You'll see that we are also providing numbers around what we think is possible for clean energy earnings in 2020. That's the far right columns. These numbers are still in line with what we've said is a very early during our September IR day. You'll see that by moving these machines we can counteract the natural trend of power production towards renewables and natural gas. It's an early look. A lot can change but here we are a decade later and still looking at an investment strategy that can deliver great returns for a couple more years. At the end of the quarter, we had over $950 million of credit carryovers on the balance sheet and at least another 2 years of production ahead of us. So we're well positioned to harvest those hard earned cash flows well into the mid- to-late 2020s. Finally, let's move to cash in and may. At September 30, we have another $300 million available cash on our balance sheet. This was the free cash flow to the year ended -- at the end of the year, and our borrowing capacity should round out a year where we can still invest deeply in our business, pay a great dividend and still fund about $1.5 billion of M&A before using any stock. When I look out our pipeline through the year-end, I think we'll be close to that level and if we happen to go over come it will only been using the very small amount of stock. This clearly demonstrates the strength of our growing cash flows. While I look out towards 2020, it looks like we can easily do another $1.5 billion of M&A without using any stock. So those are my comments, an excellent quarter, an excellent 9 months. Back to you, Pat."

First of all, you hit it exactly on the line. This is not a hard market. It's getting firmer, there's no question about it that when you get into some higher end property stuff and catastrophe exposed or places where there been losses, our people working very hard to place those. Some of the stuff is getting done at the last minute, it takes more effort, more submissions to more E&S markets to get it completed. We're seeing excess casually take a little more effort and cost more money as well. But this is not 2001, 2002 by any means. There is still plenty of capacity. Deals are getting done. And remember, our job is to mitigate this for our clients. So number one, we're training our people across the globe, get out in front of this and explain to your clients that in fact in many instances we can show you that your rates are lower today than they were in 2005, so if you had a very good run, this is not a knee-jerk. People -- the rates that are being requested in many instances make a lot of sense, but it certainly not a message that anybody wants to hear. Now let me compare that with where our hard market is and again you've got to go back to 2001, 2002 and that's when the door slam shut. You've got people getting canceled left and right. Cancellation notices are going out every month. You are out trying to explain their clients why they've been loss free, and yet the XYZ insurance company's not going to renew them and they better get ready for the consequences of significant deductible increases and possibly the reduction of limits on a drastic basis. Frankly, that's not good for anybody. I've been through 3 or 4 of those in my career and, it's a little bit like going home and finding out the electric company just decided to change the current and none of your appliances work. And so that's not good for anybody, and I don't see that happening. I do see disciplined need for rate, and that is being explained by our professionals and we're necessary, we're doing everything we can to help them find cover at a cheaper price."

We pulled them here during the last month to see if we can get an early lung. So we typically don't provide this to January. So I don't expect us to narrow that range. But also, when you look at the utilization of coal for electric power sector production, in '18, it's been declining about 3% a quarter, maybe 4% a quarter. We had a big drop off in April and through June of this year in the second quarter, I'm just looking at some of the statistics you can find out on the EIA, and they were down 18%. That's weather-related more than of it is displacement. But if you think about at the lentil look at is $50 million to $60 million worth of production related to those plans that we're making us $56 million to $58 million this year, that's may be a 4% to 5% pullback in the numbers, maybe a little bit more. But between $80 million in $100 million, we're still really don't happy with this.

With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
Let me just start by saying we had another excellent quarter. Our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments delivered 13% growth in revenues, 5.8% all-in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 66 basis points, and we completed 14 mergers with about $85 million of estimated annualized revenues, just a terrific quarter by the team.
Today, Doug and I are going to spend our time focused on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. First, organic growth. I'll review organic by geography, comment on the pricing environment and give you some insight regarding exposures; second, going through mergers and acquisitions; third, productivity and quality, Doug will hit this topic after my remarks; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture.
Okay, to organic. Let me start with the Brokerage segment. Third quarter organic was 5.8% all-in, which is similar to our organic performance through the first 6 months of 2019. I'm very pleased that all of our divisions globally contributed to this result. For example, our domestic retail PC operations had another strong quarter, with organic of about 5%. Our wholesale operations had an excellent quarter posting about 6.5% organic. This includes over 10% in our domestic open brokerage operations. Our benefits operation also had a strong showing this quarter posting base organic of about 4.5%. And then internationally, our retail brokerage operations combined to post 7% organic, with Canada up more than 10%; Australia and New Zealand up about 6%; and the U.K. up 5%. Another really strong quarter of production by the team.
Let me move to the rate environment. We've been hearing a consistent message, whether it's from our carrier partners at the CIB and the WSIA conferences or from our global leaders during our recent strategic planning sessions. Rates continue to increase across nearly all areas of the market. Our own internal data also points to an increasing PC rate environment, with global PC pricing up about 5%, which is a bit stronger than what we saw in our midyear internal pricing survey.
Let me break out what we're seeing. I'll start in the U.S. Rate overall is up around 5% in our retail operations, with Workers' Compensation the only line not showing incremental pricing strength relative to the second quarter. Within our domestic wholesale brokerage operations, pricing is approaching 6%. Moving to the U.K. U.K. retail pricing is up over 3%, a touch higher than the second quarter. And the U.K. wholesale operation's pricing is approaching double digits across many lines. In Canada, pricing is up around 8%, with property increases more than 10%. And finally in Australia and New Zealand, pricing is up around 5% to 6%, about a point lower than what we had been seeing over the previous 2 years, but still a substantial increase.
Moving to exposures. In early October, we surveyed our producers specifically asking questions related to their clients' payroll and exposure units. Over 75% said their customers' payrolls and exposure units grew during the third quarter. And more than 95% of these respondents said they were seeing similar or stronger client exposure growth as they begin working on 2020 renewals. This is consistent with the results from our May 2019 benefits benchmarking survey, where more than 70% of the 3,900 employers believe that their revenue would be increasing over the next 2 years.
So when I look around the world, PC rates and exposures continue to move higher. This is an environment in which our talented production staff excels by delivering the best insurance, risk management and benefits consulting advice by leveraging our vast array of resources and capabilities. As I sit here today, I see our fourth quarter organic nicely in the mid-5% range.
Next, let me talk about our brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 11 tuck-in brokerage acquisitions, with estimated annualized revenue of $70 million. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing family of professionals. The Brokerage team has had a very busy M&A year completing 35 mergers, with more than $330 million of annualized revenues during the first 9 months. Adding to that, we have already announced a number of mergers in October that should add an additional $90 million of annualized revenue. This is on top of our M&A pipeline report that shows $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed-upon or being prepared. While not all these transactions in the pipeline will ultimately close, as I look around the world, it's clear that our tuck-in merger opportunities remain very robust.
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Third quarter organic growth was 5.7%, with similar results in both our U.S. and international operations. The growth we are experiencing is also broad-based by client type, including large commercial, public sector, alternative markets and insurance carrier clients. Our investments in innovative products like the award-winning mobile app, GBGO, combined with expertise by product and industry, continue to set Gallagher Bassett apart from the competition. Looking forward, we see mid-single-digit organic growth in the fourth quarter.
In terms of mergers and acquisitions, we completed 3 Risk Management acquisitions this quarter adding annualized revenue of about $15 million. These acquisitions provide us with incremental capabilities and services that will benefit our clients in Australia, the U.K., Europe, and the U.S. I'd like to extend a very warm welcome to our new Gallagher Bassett professionals.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on the true competitive advantage that's Gallagher's unique culture. It is a culture that helps us attract and retain the very best talent, a culture that promotes our relationships with our carrier partners, a culture that distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment, and it's the basis for people coming together as a team to service clients focused on doing the right thing. 
Nowadays, we're hearing a lot about company culture and purpose. This is nothing new to Gallagher. We've long valued all of our stakeholders as defined in our mission statement. Ultimately, we believe if we provide value to our clients, take care of our employees and build strong relationships with our insurance carrier partners, our shareholders will be rewarded. Bottom line, our culture always has been and will continue to be a true competitive advantage.
Okay. A great quarter and first 9 months, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

I'd like to start by thanking the team for another outstanding quarter. It really does position us very well to close out an outstanding 2019 here in the fourth quarter. 
Today, I'll make a few comments from the earnings release. I'll walk you then through the CFO Commentary document we've posted on our website, and I'll conclude with some comments in cash and M&A.
Okay. Let's go to the bottom of Page 5 of the earnings release, the Brokerage segment margins. For the quarter, we delivered 68 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That's terrific result on 5.8% organic growth. And this marks the 32nd straight quarter of Brokerage segment margin expansion, a truly amazing run and an excellent illustration how we're constantly focusing on raising our quality and productivity. Looking forward, we would expect to see about 50 basis points of margin expansion if organic growth is in the low- to mid-5% range.
Let's flip to Page 6 of the earnings release to the Risk Management segment margins. During the quarter, we posted 18 points of adjusted EBITDAC margin. That's really great work by the team, but well above the upper end of our targets. So we wouldn't expect to see that in the fourth quarter. Perhaps more like 17% to 17.5%, which would finish off the year nicely towards the higher end of our full year target, also in that 17% to 17.5% range.
Let's now move to the CFO Commentary document that we can find at our website. Let's turn to Page 2. Relative to third quarter estimates that we provided during our September IR Day, nearly all of the lines came in very close. A few other comments. First, our integration efforts. Mostly related to the aerospace and Stackhouse mergers we did this summer. Both are moving along as planned and on budget. Second, we're making nice progress on our back office support layer transformation project we discussed at our IR Day. We've already contracted a few hundred positions and we have a nice line of sight in the areas where we can lower our cost and improve our service quality by centralization, standardization and automation of most of our back office functions. We'll redeploy these savings into processes to help us drive our organic growth, sales support and sales management systems and tools, data and sales analytics, additional production talent, marketing and branding. In other words, all are efforts that will help us sell more, hire more and acquire more.
And finally, still in Page 2, a modeling note. Please make sure your models are picking up our estimates for changes in estimated earnouts and also earnings from noncontrolling interests. Neither are big numbers but still can move your estimates by $0.01 or $0.02.
We'll stay in the CFO commentary document but flip to Page 3 to the Corporate segment. Relative to the estimates we provided during our September IR Day, interesting corporate expense lines were both within the range. Acquisition expense was just a touch higher, mostly due to a couple of smaller international deals.
And then finally, the clean energy. You'll see that the third quarter adjusted results came in a couple million dollars above the midpoint of the range, a great quarter. Looking forward, fourth quarter is looking a bit lower than what we are seeing during our IR Day. Weather thus far in October is not nearly as hot as last year. So we moderated our fourth quarter outlook just a bit. That said, it's stacking up to be another $100 million year for this investment strategy.
You'll also see a clean energy adjustment line this quarter. The clean energy had a very busy quarter. Footnote 2 describes 4 items. We resolved a 5-year patent squabble with a great outcome. We prevailed in Tax Court. We opened new patent defense litigation, which we think is without merit, but we intend on defending that rigorously. And finally, we are making terrific progress in moving 3 of our 2011-era lower production machines into really great 2009-era locations. You can see this clearly on Page 4 of the CFO commentary. It's in the fourth row on that page. It shows the machines are currently producing less than $1 million of earnings here in 2019 but by moving them, we can achieve $10 million to $15 million of earnings. Hats off to those engineers and operators that we used to make this happen. Really a great job. That's also affirmation from our utility partners that we truly have an excellent process and that we're delivering substantial environmental benefits.
We'll stay on the Page 4. You'll see that we are also providing numbers around what we think is possible for clean energy earnings in 2020. That's the far right columns. These numbers are still in line with what we've said as a very early month during our September IR Day. You'll see that by moving these machines, we can counteract the natural trends in power production towards renewables and natural gas. It's an early look. A lot can change but here we are a decade later and still looking at an investment strategy that can deliver great returns for a couple more years.
At the end of the quarter, we have over $950 million of credit carryovers on our balance sheet and at least another 2 years of production ahead of us. So we're well positioned to harvest those harder earned cash flows well into the mid-to-late 2020s.
Finally, let's move to cash and M&A. At September 30, we had another $300 million available cash on our balance sheet. This was our free cash flow through the year end -- through the end of the year, and our borrowing capacity should round out a year where we can still invest deeply in our business, pay a great dividend and still fund about $1.5 billion of M&A before using any stock. When I look out our pipeline through the year-end, I think we'll be close to that level. And if we happen to go over, it would only mean using a very small amount of stock. This clearly demonstrates the strength of our growing cash flows. When I look out towards 2020, it looks like we can easily do another $1.5 billion of M&A without using any stock.
So those are my comments, an excellent quarter, an excellent 9 months. Back to you, Pat."

First of all, you hit it exactly on exactly my line. This is not a hard market. It's getting firmer, there's no question about it that when you get into some higher-end property stuff and catastrophe exposed or places where there've been losses, our people working very hard to place those. Some of the stuff is getting done at the last minute, it takes more effort, more submissions to more E&S markets to get it completed. We're seeing excess casualty. It takes a little more effort and cost more money as well.
But this is not 2001, 2002 by any means. There is still plenty of capacity. Deals are getting done. And remember, our job is to mitigate this for our clients. So number one, we're training our people across the globe, get out in front of this and explain to your clients that in fact in many instances we can show you that your rates are lower today than they were in 2005. So you've had a very good run, this is not a knee-jerk. People -- the rates that are being requested in many instances make a lot of sense, but it's certainly not a message that anybody wants to hear.
Now let me compare that with what a hard market is. And again, you've got to go back to 2001, 2002 and that's when the door slam shut. You've got people getting canceled left and right. Cancellation notices are going out every month. You're out trying to explain to your clients why they've been loss-free and yet the XYZ insurance company is not going to renew them. And they better get ready for the consequences of significant deductible increases and possibly the reduction of limits on a drastic basis.
Frankly, that's not good for anybody. Now I've been through 3 or 4 of those in my career and it's a little bit like going home and finding out the electric company just decided to change the current and none of your appliances work. And so that's not good for anybody and I don't see that happening. I do see disciplined need for rate, and that is being explained by our professionals and where necessary, we're doing everything we can to help them find cover at a cheaper price."

We pulled them here during the last month to see if we can get an early lock. So we typically don't provide this to January. So I'd expect us to narrow that range. But also, when you look at the utilization of coal for electric power sector production, in '18, it had been declining about 3% a quarter, maybe 4% a quarter. We had a big drop off in April through June of this year in the second quarter. I mean I'm just looking at some of the statistics you can find out on the EIA, and they were down 18%. That's weather-related more than it is displacement. But if you really think about it, the line to look at is the $50 million to $60 million worth of production related to those plants that we're making us $56 million to $58 million this year, that's maybe a 4% to 5% pullback in the numbers, maybe a little bit more. But between $80 million and $100 million, we're still really darn happy with this.

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions.

With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
Let me just start by saying we had another excellent quarter. Our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments delivered 13% growth in revenues, 5.8% all-in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 66 basis points, and we completed 14 mergers with about $85 million of estimated annualized revenues, just a terrific quarter by the team.
Today, Doug and I are going to spend our time focused on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. First, organic growth. I'll review organic by geography, comment on the pricing environment and give you some insight regarding exposures; second, growing through mergers and acquisitions; third, productivity and quality, Doug will hit this topic after my remarks; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture.
Okay, to organic. Let me start with the Brokerage segment. Third quarter organic was 5.8% all-in, which is similar to our organic performance through the first 6 months of 2019. I'm very pleased that all of our divisions globally contributed to this result. For example, our domestic retail PC operations had another strong quarter, with organic of about 5%. Our wholesale operations had an excellent quarter posting about 6.5% organic. This includes over 10% in our domestic open brokerage operations. Our benefits operations also had a strong showing this quarter posting base organic of about 4.5%. And then internationally, our retail brokerage operations combined to post 7% organic, with Canada up more than 10%; Australia and New Zealand up about 6%; and the U.K. up 5%. Another really strong quarter of production by the team.
Let me move to the rate environment. We've been hearing a consistent message, whether it's from our carrier partners at the CIAB and the WSIA conferences or from our global leaders during our recent strategic planning sessions. Rates continue to increase across nearly all areas of the market. Our own internal data also points to an increasing PC rate environment, with global PC pricing up about 5%, which is a bit stronger than what we saw in our midyear internal pricing survey.
Let me break down what we're seeing. I'll start in the U.S. Rate overall is up around 5% in our retail operations, with Workers' Compensation the only line not showing incremental pricing strength relative to the second quarter. Within our domestic wholesale brokerage operations, pricing is approaching 6%. Moving to the U.K. U.K. retail pricing is up over 3%, a touch higher than the second quarter. And the U.K. wholesale operation's pricing is approaching double digits across many lines. In Canada, pricing is up around 8%, with property increases more than 10%. And finally in Australia and New Zealand, pricing is up around 5% to 6%, about a point lower than what we had been seeing over the previous 2 years, but still a substantial increase.
Moving to exposures. In early October, we surveyed our producers specifically asking questions related to their clients' payroll and exposure units. Over 75% said their customers' payrolls and exposure units grew during the third quarter. And more than 95% of these respondents said they were seeing similar or stronger client exposure growth as they begin working on 2020 renewals. This is consistent with the results from our May 2019 benefits benchmarking survey, where more than 70% of the 3,900 employers believe that their revenue would be increasing over the next 2 years.
So when I look around the world, PC rates and exposures continue to move higher. This is an environment in which our talented production staff excels by delivering the best insurance, risk management and benefits consulting advice by leveraging our vast array of resources and capabilities. As I sit here today, I see our fourth quarter organic nicely in the mid-5% range.
Next, let me talk about our brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 11 tuck-in brokerage acquisitions, with estimated annualized revenue of $70 million. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing family of professionals. The Brokerage team has had a very busy M&A year completing 35 mergers, with more than $330 million of annualized revenues during the first 9 months. Adding to that, we have already announced a number of mergers in October that should add an additional $90 million of annualized revenue. This is on top of our M&A pipeline report that shows $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed-upon or being prepared. While not all these transactions in the pipeline will ultimately close, as I look around the world, it's clear that our tuck-in merger opportunities remain very robust.
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Third quarter organic growth was 5.7%, with similar results in both our U.S. and international operations. The growth we are experiencing is also broad-based by client type, including large commercial, public sector, alternative markets and insurance carrier clients. Our investments in innovative products like the award-winning mobile app, GBGO, combined with expertise by product and industry, continue to set Gallagher Bassett apart from the competition. Looking forward, we see mid-single-digit organic growth in the fourth quarter.
In terms of mergers and acquisitions, we completed 3 Risk Management acquisitions this quarter adding annualized revenue of about $15 million. These acquisitions provide us with incremental capabilities and services that will benefit our clients in Australia, the U.K., Europe, and the U.S. I'd like to extend a very warm welcome to our new Gallagher Bassett professionals.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on a true competitive advantage, that's Gallagher's unique culture. It is a culture that helps us attract and retain the very best talent, a culture that promotes our relationships with our carrier partners, a culture that distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment, and it's the basis for our people coming together as a team to service clients, focused on doing the right thing. 
Nowadays, we're hearing a lot about company culture and purpose. This is nothing new to Gallagher. We've long valued all of our stakeholders as defined in our mission statement. Ultimately, we believe if we provide value to our clients, take care of our employees and build strong relationships with our insurance carrier partners, our shareholders will be rewarded. Bottom line, our culture always has been and will continue to be a true competitive advantage.
Okay. A great quarter and first 9 months, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

I'd like to start by thanking the team for another outstanding quarter. It really does position us very well to close out an outstanding 2019 here in the fourth quarter. 
Today, I'll make a few comments from the earnings release. I'll walk you then through the CFO Commentary document we've posted on our website, and I'll conclude with some comments on cash and M&A.
Okay. Let's go to the bottom of Page 5 of the earnings release, the Brokerage segment margins. For the quarter, we delivered 68 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That's terrific results on 5.8% organic growth. And this marks the 32nd straight quarter of Brokerage segment margin expansion, a truly amazing run and an excellent illustration of how we're constantly focusing on raising our quality and productivity. Looking forward, we would expect to see about 50 basis points of margin expansion if organic growth is in the low- to mid-5% range.
Let's flip to Page 6 of the earnings release to the Risk Management segment margins. During the quarter, we posted 18 points of adjusted EBITDAC margin. That's really great work by the team, but well above the upper end of our targets. So we wouldn't expect to see that in the fourth quarter. Perhaps more like 17% to 17.5%, which would finish off the year nicely towards the higher end of our full year target, also in that 17% to 17.5% range.
Let's now move to the CFO Commentary document that we can find on our website. Let's turn to Page 2. Relative to third quarter estimates that we provided during our September IR Day, nearly all of the lines came in very close. A few other comments. First, our integration efforts. Mostly related to the aerospace and Stackhouse mergers we did this summer. Both are moving along as planned and on budget. Second, we're making nice progress on our back office support layer transformation project we discussed at our IR Day. We've already contracted a few hundred positions and we have a nice line of sight into areas where we can lower our cost and improve our service quality by centralization, standardization and automation of most of our back office functions. We'll redeploy these savings into processes to help us drive our organic growth, sales support and sales management systems and tools, data and sales analytics, additional production talent, marketing and branding. In other words, all our efforts that will help us sell more, hire more and acquire more.
And finally, still in Page 2, a modeling note. Please make sure your models are picking up our estimates for changes in estimated earnouts and also earnings from noncontrolling interests. Neither are big numbers but still can move your estimates by $0.01 or $0.02.
We'll stay in the CFO commentary document but flip to Page 3 to the Corporate segment. Relative to the estimates we provided during our September IR Day, interest and corporate expense lines were both within the range. Acquisition expense was just a touch higher, mostly due to a couple of smaller international deals.
And then finally, to clean energy. You'll see that the third quarter adjusted results came in a couple million dollars above the midpoint of the range, a great quarter. Looking forward, fourth quarter is looking a bit lower than what we were seeing during our IR Day. Weather thus far in October is not nearly as hot as last year. So we moderated our fourth quarter outlook just a bit. That said, it's stacking up to be another $100 million year for this investment strategy.
You'll also see a clean energy adjustment line this quarter. The clean energy had a very busy quarter. Footnote 2 describes 4 items. We resolved a 5-year patent squabble with a great outcome. We prevailed in Tax Court. We opened new patent defense litigation, which we think is without merit, but we intend on defending it rigorously. And finally, we are making terrific progress in moving 3 of our 2011-era lower production machines into really great 2009-era locations. You can see this clearly on Page 4 of the CFO commentary. It's in the fourth row on that page. It shows the machines are currently producing less than $1 million of earnings here in 2019 but by moving them, we can achieve $10 million to $15 million of earnings. Hats off to those engineers and operators that we used to make this happen. Really a great job. That's also an affirmation from our utility partners that we truly have an excellent process and that we're delivering substantial environmental benefits.
We'll stay on the Page 4. You'll see that we are also providing numbers around what we think is possible for clean energy earnings in 2020. That's the far right columns. These numbers are still in line with what we've said as a very early look during our September IR Day. You'll see that by moving these machines, we can counteract the natural trends in power production towards renewables and natural gas. It's an early look. A lot can change but here we are a decade later and still looking at an investment strategy that can deliver great returns for a couple more years.
At the end of the quarter, we have over $950 million of credit carryovers on our balance sheet and at least another 2 years of production ahead of us. So we're well positioned to harvest those hard earned cash flows well into the mid-to-late 2020s.
Finally, let's move to cash and M&A. At September 30, we had about $300 million available cash on our balance sheet. This was our free cash flow through the year end -- through the end of the year, and our borrowing capacity should round out a year where we can still invest deeply in our business, pay a great dividend and still fund about $1.5 billion of M&A before using any stock. When I look out our pipeline through year-end, I think we'll be close to that level. And if we happen to go over, it would only mean using a very small amount of stock. This clearly demonstrates the strength of our growing cash flows. When I look out towards 2020, it looks like we can easily do another $1.5 billion of M&A without using any stock.
So those are my comments, an excellent quarter, an excellent 9 months. Back to you, Pat."

And there are certain views out there that rates will continue to harden. I know, Pat, you've said that 5% is no hard market, and you said you got to go all the way back to 2001 to see what a real hard market looks like. Since it's been a while, let's just -- if we had to hypothesize that rates just continue to move north, maybe you can kind of help us understand what a hard market would mean in terms of A.J. Gallagher's impact on your financials and the pluses and the minuses?"

First of all, you hit it right on -- exactly my line. This is not a hard market. It's getting firmer, there's no question about it, that when you get into some higher-end property stuff and catastrophe exposed or places where there've been losses, our people working very hard to place those. Some of the stuff is getting done at the last minute, it takes more effort, more submissions to more E&S markets to get it completed. We're seeing excess casualty. It takes a little more effort and cost more money as well.
But this is not 2001, 2002 by any means. There is still plenty of capacity. Deals are getting done. And remember, our job is to mitigate this for our clients. So number one, we're training our people across the globe, get out in front of this and explain to your clients that in fact in many instances we can show you that your rates are lower today than they were in 2005. So you've had a very good run, this is not a knee-jerk. People -- the rates that are being requested in many instances make a lot of sense, but it's certainly not a message that anybody wants to hear.
Now let me compare that with what a hard market is. And again, you've got to go back to 2001, 2002 and that's when the door slammed shut. You got people getting canceled left and right. Cancellation notices are going out every month. You're out trying to explain to your clients why they've been loss-free and yet the XYZ insurance company is not going to renew them. And they better get ready for the consequences of significant deductible increases and possibly the reduction of limits on a drastic basis.
Frankly, that's not good for anybody. Now I've been through 3 or 4 of those in my career and it's a little bit like going home and finding out the electric company just decided to change the current and none of your appliances work. And so that's not good for anybody and I don't see that happening. I do see disciplined need for rate, and that is being explained by our professionals and where necessary, we're doing everything we can to help them find cover at a cheaper price."

That's weather-related more than it is displacement. But if you really think about it, the line to look at is the $50 million to $60 million worth of production related to those plants that were making us $56 million to $58 million this year, that's maybe a 4% to 5% pullback in the numbers, maybe a little bit more. But between $80 million and $100 million, we're still really darn happy with this.

And they're not going to be pie-in-the-sky because the fact is, when you tell us your payrolls and your exposure -- other exposure and sales are going up, you're going to have a higher deposit on your insurance premium. So there's a natural tendency to lowball. And if you lowball, you get a free loan from the insurance company. So no, no, no. These guys really have their ear to the ground."

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions.

With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
Let me just start by saying we had another excellent quarter. Our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments delivered 13% growth in revenues, 5.8% all-in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 66 basis points, and we completed 14 mergers with about $85 million of estimated annualized revenues, just a terrific quarter by the team.
Today, Doug and I are going to spend our time focused on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. First, organic growth. I'll review organic by geography, comment on the pricing environment and give you some insight regarding exposures; second, growing through mergers and acquisitions; third, productivity and quality, Doug will hit this topic after my remarks; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture.
Okay, to organic. Let me start with the Brokerage segment. Third quarter organic was 5.8% all-in, which is similar to our organic performance through the first 6 months of 2019. I'm very pleased that all of our divisions globally contributed to this result. For example, our domestic retail PC operations had another strong quarter, with organic of about 5%. Our wholesale operations had an excellent quarter posting about 6.5% organic. This includes over 10% in our domestic open brokerage operations. Our benefits operations also had a strong showing this quarter posting base organic of about 4.5%. And then internationally, our retail brokerage operations combined to post 7% organic, with Canada up more than 10%; Australia and New Zealand up about 6%; and the U.K. up 5%. Another really strong quarter of production by the team.
Let me move to the rate environment. We've been hearing a consistent message, whether it's from our carrier partners at the CIAB and the WSIA conferences or from our global leaders during our recent strategic planning sessions. Rates continue to increase across nearly all areas of the market. Our own internal data also points to an increasing PC rate environment, with global PC pricing up about 5%, which is a bit stronger than what we saw in our midyear internal pricing survey.
Let me break down what we're seeing. I'll start in the U.S. Rate overall is up around 5% in our retail operations, with Workers' Compensation the only line not showing incremental pricing strength relative to the second quarter. Within our domestic wholesale brokerage operations, pricing is approaching 6%. Moving to the U.K. U.K. retail pricing is up over 3%, a touch higher than the second quarter. And the U.K. wholesale operation's pricing is approaching double digits across many lines. In Canada, pricing is up around 8%, with property increases more than 10%. And finally in Australia and New Zealand, pricing is up around 5% to 6%, about a point lower than what we had been seeing over the previous 2 years, but still a substantial increase.
Moving to exposures. In early October, we surveyed our producers specifically asking questions related to their clients' payroll and exposure units. Over 75% said their customers' payrolls and exposure units grew during the third quarter. And more than 95% of these respondents said they were seeing similar or stronger client exposure growth as they begin working on 2020 renewals. This is consistent with the results from our May 2019 benefits benchmarking survey, where more than 70% of the 3,900 employers believe that their revenue would be increasing over the next 2 years.
So when I look around the world, PC rates and exposures continue to move higher. This is an environment in which our talented production staff excels by delivering the best insurance, risk management and benefits consulting advice by leveraging our vast array of resources and capabilities. As I sit here today, I see our fourth quarter organic nicely in the mid-5% range.
Next, let me talk about our brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 11 tuck-in brokerage acquisitions, with estimated annualized revenue of $70 million. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing family of professionals. The Brokerage team has had a very busy M&A year completing 35 mergers, with more than $330 million of annualized revenues during the first 9 months. Adding to that, we have already announced a number of mergers in October that should add an additional $90 million of annualized revenue. This is on top of our M&A pipeline report that shows $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed-upon or being prepared. While not all these transactions in the pipeline will ultimately close, as I look around the world, it's clear that our tuck-in merger opportunities remain very robust.
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Third quarter organic growth was 5.7%, with similar results in both our U.S. and international operations. The growth we are experiencing is also broad-based by client type, including large commercial, public sector, alternative markets and insurance carrier clients. Our investments in innovative products like the award-winning mobile app, GBGO, combined with expertise by product and industry, continue to set Gallagher Bassett apart from the competition. Looking forward, we see mid-single-digit organic growth in the fourth quarter.
In terms of mergers and acquisitions, we completed 3 Risk Management acquisitions this quarter adding annualized revenue of about $15 million. These acquisitions provide us with incremental capabilities and services that will benefit our clients in Australia, the U.K., Europe, and the U.S. I'd like to extend a very warm welcome to our new Gallagher Bassett professionals.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on a true competitive advantage, that's Gallagher's unique culture. It is a culture that helps us attract and retain the very best talent, a culture that promotes our relationships with our carrier partners, a culture that distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment, and it's the basis for our people coming together as a team to service clients, focused on doing the right thing. 
Nowadays, we're hearing a lot about company culture and purpose. This is nothing new to Gallagher. We've long valued all of our stakeholders as defined in our mission statement. Ultimately, we believe if we provide value to our clients, take care of our employees and build strong relationships with our insurance carrier partners, our shareholders will be rewarded. Bottom line, our culture always has been and will continue to be a true competitive advantage.
Okay. A great quarter and first 9 months, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

I'd like to start by thanking the team for another outstanding quarter. It really does position us very well to close out an outstanding 2019 here in the fourth quarter. 
Today, I'll make a few comments from the earnings release. I'll walk you then through the CFO Commentary document we've posted on our website, and I'll conclude with some comments on cash and M&A.
Okay. Let's go to the bottom of Page 5 of the earnings release, the Brokerage segment margins. For the quarter, we delivered 68 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That's terrific results on 5.8% organic growth. And this marks the 32nd straight quarter of Brokerage segment margin expansion, a truly amazing run and an excellent illustration of how we're constantly focusing on raising our quality and productivity. Looking forward, we would expect to see about 50 basis points of margin expansion if organic growth is in the low- to mid-5% range.
Let's flip to Page 6 of the earnings release to the Risk Management segment margins. During the quarter, we posted 18 points of adjusted EBITDAC margin. That's really great work by the team, but well above the upper end of our targets. So we wouldn't expect to see that in the fourth quarter. Perhaps more like 17% to 17.5%, which would finish off the year nicely towards the higher end of our full year target, also in that 17% to 17.5% range.
Let's now move to the CFO Commentary document that we can find on our website. Let's turn to Page 2. Relative to third quarter estimates that we provided during our September IR Day, nearly all of the lines came in very close. A few other comments. First, our integration efforts. Mostly related to the aerospace and Stackhouse mergers we did this summer. Both are moving along as planned and on budget. Second, we're making nice progress on our back office support layer transformation project we discussed at our IR Day. We've already contracted a few hundred positions and we have a nice line of sight into areas where we can lower our cost and improve our service quality by centralization, standardization and automation of most of our back office functions. We'll redeploy these savings into processes to help us drive our organic growth, sales support and sales management systems and tools, data and sales analytics, additional production talent, marketing and branding. In other words, all our efforts that will help us sell more, hire more and acquire more.
And finally, still in Page 2, a modeling note. Please make sure your models are picking up our estimates for changes in estimated earnouts and also earnings from noncontrolling interests. Neither are big numbers but still can move your estimates by $0.01 or $0.02.
We'll stay in the CFO commentary document but flip to Page 3 to the Corporate segment. Relative to the estimates we provided during our September IR Day, interest and corporate expense lines were both within the range. Acquisition expense was just a touch higher, mostly due to a couple of smaller international deals.
And then finally, to clean energy. You'll see that the third quarter adjusted results came in a couple million dollars above the midpoint of the range, a great quarter. Looking forward, fourth quarter is looking a bit lower than what we were seeing during our IR Day. Weather thus far in October is not nearly as hot as last year. So we moderated our fourth quarter outlook just a bit. That said, it's stacking up to be another $100 million year for this investment strategy.
You'll also see a clean energy adjustment line this quarter. The clean energy had a very busy quarter. Footnote 2 describes 4 items. We resolved a 5-year patent squabble with a great outcome. We prevailed in Tax Court. We opened new patent defense litigation, which we think is without merit, but we intend on defending it rigorously. And finally, we are making terrific progress in moving 3 of our 2011-era lower production machines into really great 2009-era locations. You can see this clearly on Page 4 of the CFO commentary. It's in the fourth row on that page. It shows the machines are currently producing less than $1 million of earnings here in 2019 but by moving them, we can achieve $10 million to $15 million of earnings. Hats off to those engineers and operators that we used to make this happen. Really a great job. That's also an affirmation from our utility partners that we truly have an excellent process and that we're delivering substantial environmental benefits.
We'll stay on the Page 4. You'll see that we are also providing numbers around what we think is possible for clean energy earnings in 2020. That's the far right columns. These numbers are still in line with what we've said as a very early look during our September IR Day. You'll see that by moving these machines, we can counteract the natural trends in power production towards renewables and natural gas. It's an early look. A lot can change but here we are a decade later and still looking at an investment strategy that can deliver great returns for a couple more years.
At the end of the quarter, we have over $950 million of credit carryovers on our balance sheet and at least another 2 years of production ahead of us. So we're well positioned to harvest those hard earned cash flows well into the mid-to-late 2020s.
Finally, let's move to cash and M&A. At September 30, we had about $300 million available cash on our balance sheet. This was our free cash flow through the year-end -- through the end of the year, and our borrowing capacity should round out a year where we can still invest deeply in our business, pay a great dividend and still fund about $1.5 billion of M&A before using any stock. When I look out our pipeline through year-end, I think we'll be close to that level. And if we happen to go over, it would only mean using a very small amount of stock. This clearly demonstrates the strength of our growing cash flows. When I look out towards 2020, it looks like we can easily do another $1.5 billion of M&A without using any stock.
So those are my comments, an excellent quarter, an excellent 9 months. Back to you, Pat."

First of all, you hit it right on -- exactly my line. This is not a hard market. It's getting firmer, there's no question about it, that when you get into some higher-end property stuff and catastrophe exposed or places where there've been losses, our people working very hard to place those. Some of the stuff is getting done at the last minute, it takes more effort, more submissions to more E&S markets to get it completed. We're seeing excess casualty. It takes a little more effort and cost more money as well.
But this is not 2001, 2002 by any means. There is still plenty of capacity. Deals are getting done. And remember, our job is to mitigate this for our clients. So number one, we're training our people across the globe, get out in front of this and explain to your clients that in fact in many instances we can show you that your rates are lower today than they were in 2005. So you've had a very good run, this is not a knee-jerk. People -- the rates that are being requested in many instances make a lot of sense, but it's certainly not a message that anybody wants to hear.
Now let me compare that with what a hard market is. And again, you've got to go back to 2001, 2002 and that's when the door slammed shut. You got people getting canceled left and right. Cancellation notices are going out every month. You're out trying to explain to your clients why they've been loss-free and yet the XYZ insurance company is not going to renew them. And they better get ready for the consequences of significant deductible increases and possibly the reduction of limits on a drastic basis.
Frankly, that's not good for anybody. Now I've been through 3 or 4 of those in my career and it's a little bit like going home and finding out the electric company just decided to change the current and none of your appliances work. And so that's not good for anybody and I don't see that happening. I do see disciplined need for rate, and that is being explained by our professionals and where necessary, we're doing everything we can to help them find cover at a cheaper price."

We pulled them here during the last month to see if we can get an early look. So we typically don't provide this till January. So I'd expect to narrow that range. But also, when you look at the utilization of coal for electric power sector production, in '18, it had been declining about 3% a quarter, maybe 4% a quarter. We had a big drop-off in April and -- through June of this year, and the second quarter -- I'm just looking at some of the statistics you can find out on the EIA, and they were down 18%. That's weather-related more than it is displacement. But if you really think about it, the line to look at is the $50 million to $60 million worth of production related to those plants that were making us $56 million to $58 million this year, that's maybe a 4% to 5% pullback in the numbers, maybe a little bit more. But between $80 million and $100 million, we're still really darn happy with this. When we set out 10 or 11 years ago to do this investment strategy, the idea of us making, call it at the midpoint, around $90 million in the ninth year, that's -- I don't think we would have dreamt of that.
