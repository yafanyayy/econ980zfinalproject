First, I would like to thank our dedicated [indiscernible] employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. They are very much appreciated. 
We are pleased with our 2018 operational performance, despite the challenges we faced in some of our businesses, most notably, Home Furniture and Fashion Bed. 
Fourth quarter sales increased 6% to $1.05 billion on flat volume. Raw material related price increases, net of currency impact added 3% to sales growth and acquisitions also added 3%. 
Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. This includes several items outlined in yesterday's press release that amount to a $0.23 per share reduction in earnings. 
Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 5% to $0.62 per share from $0.59 last year. 
This increase is primarily due to the improved metal margins in our Steel Rod business. 
In 2018, sales grew 8% to $4.3 billion with organic sales up 6% from a combination of 3% volume growth and a 3% benefit from raw material related price increases and currency impact. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures completed in 2017 added 2% to sales growth. All-year sales benefited from ongoing content gains and new program awards in automotive, market share gains and continued shift to Comfort Core and Quantum Edge innerspring and U.S. Spring and strong growth in Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and aerospace. These improvements were partially offset by declines in other businesses, primarily Home Furniture, Fashion Bed and flooring products. 
Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.26 from $2.14 in 2017. 
Earnings from 2018 include the fourth quarter $0.23 per share reduction just mentioned, and a third quarter $0.01 per share benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for a net reduction of $0.22 per share. 
Full year 2017 earnings included a $0.32 per share net reduction primarily from cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Adjusted full year earnings per share increased 1% to $2.48. Adjusted EPS benefited from improved mental margins in our steel mill and higher sales. 
These improvements were largely offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the lag associated with passing along ongoing inflation. 
In 2018, we made some important strategic moves that should reinforce achievement of our long-term financial goals. 
In January, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders, a leading global manufacturer of engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market. PHC is our first business in the hydraulic cylinder industry, a market we identify through our styles of competition analysis. 
In November, we announced the acquisition of a lead comfort solutions, and we have completed the acquisition last month. 
ECS is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. The purchase price was $1.25 billion and was financed through an expansion of our commercial paper program and the issue of a $500 million 5-year term loan with our current bank group. 
Through the ECS acquisition, we have gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology along with scale and the production of private label finished mattresses. 
Our combined expertise since spring and foam technology make us the leading provider of differentiated products for the global bedding industry. 
ECS's annualized sales for the fiscal year ended September 2018 were $611 million, and we expect ECS to add approximately $675 million to sales growth of 2019. 
ECS is in our new Speciality Foams business units within the Residential Products segment reporting to Perry. 
As previously discussed, we continued an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses and initiated restructuring activity late last year. 
Restructuring related charges in 2018 were $16 million, and we expect an additional $17 million of charges in 2019. 
The restructuring activity should be substantially completed by the end of this year. 
In 2019, we expect these acquisitions and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and increased margins. Matt will discuss our guidance for the year later in the call. 
Finally, the quarterly slide decks that we posted to the Investor Relations website contains unit growth rates for innerspring and boxspring pieces within our Residential Products segment. 
Because of content gains including strong growth of our Comfort Core innerspring and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. 
Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we will stop reporting unit growth or innersprings and boxing. We will continue to provide dollar growth as we do for our other business units. With all -- I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

In 2018, we generated operating cash flow of $440 million, which once again included our typically strong fourth quarter cash flow performance. We continue to have a strong and sharp focus on working capital",869,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning everyone. 
In 2018, we generated operating cash flow of $440 million, which once again included our typically strong fourth quarter cash flow performance. 
We continue to have a strong and sharp focus on working capital management, and we ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.6%. 
We repatriated $141 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter bringing our full-year total to $314 million. 
In November, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend, a 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Our dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings was 60% for 2018 at the top of our target dividend payout range of 50% to 60%. 
Beginning in 2019, in conjunction with the increasing leverage from the ECS acquisition, we announced a modest change in our dividend payout target to approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. 
We expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. 
In Friday's closing price of $40.97, our current yield is 3.7%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend [indiscernible]. 
For the full year, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock at an average price of $43.10, and issued 1.2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
During the year, we acquired PHC and 2 small TL component operations. 
We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities, primarily in automotive and bedding. 
We increased the borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from $800 million to $1.2 billion in connection with the funding of the ECS transaction. 
We ended the year with debt at 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. After completing the ECS acquisition in January, our debt levels increased as expected to approximately 3.5x. 
We are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade, credit-rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by temporarily suspended share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. 
We asses on overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. 
Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
While our recent performance has not met this target, we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy and prudent use of capital will support achievement of our [ top third  ] goal over time. 
Sales growth in 2019 will benefit significantly from the ECS acquisition. We also expect sales growth in automotive, U.S. spring, aerospace and hydraulic cylinders, partially offset by plan declines in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture relating to restructuring efforts and from less promotional activity in Adjustable Bed. 
2019 sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year. 
ECS should add approximately $675 million to sales. 
In addition to ECS, same location sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%. 
Earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related cost. 
Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate. 
As we have previously stated, the ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS in 2019. 
EPS guidance assumes a full-year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the non-reoccurrence of some valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019. 
The impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and tax implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. We expect 2019 depreciation and amortization to approximate $210 million, net interest of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our 2019 full-year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. 
While we do not issue specific quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to be somewhat consistent across the quarters in 2019. 
We expect adjusted margins in the first quarter to be lower than first quarter last year, in part due to the purchase accounting for acquired ECS inventory. And we expect year-over-year adjusted margins to be flat to slightly improving by the second half of the year. 
Cash from operations should approximate [ $550 million  ] in 2019. Capital expenditures should be near $195 million for the year and dividends should require $205 million of cash. 
Our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. 
Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain. One, organic growth and [indiscernible] capital expenditure in working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases. 
As previously stated, we will temporarily suspended share repurchases, reduce acquisition spending and prioritize debt repayment after organic growth in dividends. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

We've had double-digit increases in our new awards every year since I've been counting this, since 2011. Overall, CAGR of over 15% since that time. So we think the visibility that we have there, it really gives us a strong case to stand by our goal.

I think you're starting to see that performance stabilize in the fourth quarter. 
We are moving aggressively and expect to complete the implementation largely by that into the first half of the year. 
So for '19 in that business, I think we do see some shrinkage of sales trying to think about it in terms of mid-single-digit. But with increased -- significant increase in earning power on that side. On the Fashion Bed side, I think we'll see more significant sales declines as we continue to trim the product categories there and really focus on [indiscernible] inventory.

The other thing going back to Karl's comments on the effort to get in place of dumping order. With that delay, because of the government shut down being pushed out, we now feel like that somewhere around the end of February, product that is landed would be subject to the 90-day look back. And in a lot of cases that has a cooling effect because obviously an important record needs to understand their cost basis whenever they are importing product.

But first of all, there won't be surprised of course that reflects the ECS acquisition, and we have been very clearly stating that the sales expectation that will arrive from ECS this year is estimated to be $675 million. 
You also recall reading that we anticipate fully that the EBITDA margin on that sales base will be higher than the company average. So you could do math there to see the EBITDA could be driving significantly higher from this 2018 level of [ $573 million  ] that we just posted companywide for Leggett before we owned ECS. 
Secondly, as you saw in the fourth quarter, once again, our working capital performance strongly ended the year, and I know both Mitch and Perry and certainly Karl are working hard to be able to not ride in at 12% range of working capital, which we did most of 2018. We're working hard to make sure that improve performance of a pretty significant nature by the end of the year is sustainable throughout 2019. That will naturally flush up in meaningful amount of cash. And otherwise, when you think about go further to the cash flow statement and capital expenditure is pretty predictable. We talked about M&A dialing down significantly, share repurchases, segments call just mentioned. So that $550 million of operating cash flow is readily correlated to the higher earnings ECS being part of the family, working capital concentration and focus and really no surprise uses of cash on the operating side.

Said differently that the chemical input cost have decreased significantly. So the resultant sales dollars will be lower than originally expected, but the EBITDA margins were not been negatively impacted by that. So you are -- or observation is correct. The forecast is about a 10% growth if raw material input cost would have stayed neutral, we would have been looking at about a 15% growth rate."

First, I would like to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. They are very much appreciated.
We are pleased with our 2018 operational performance, despite the challenges we faced in some of our businesses, most notably, Home Furniture and Fashion Bed.
Fourth quarter sales increased 6% to $1.05 billion on flat volume. Raw material related price increases, net of currency impact, added 3% to sales growth and acquisitions also added 3%.
Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. This includes several items outlined in yesterday's press release that amount to a $0.23 per share reduction in earnings.
Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 5% to $0.62 per share from $0.59 last year. This increase is primarily due to improved metal margins in our Steel Rod business.
In 2018, sales grew 8% to $4.3 billion, with organic sales up 6% from a combination of 3% volume growth and a 3% benefit from raw material related price increases and currency impact.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures completed in 2017 added 2% to sales growth. Whole year sales benefited from ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive, market share gains and continued shift to Comfort Core and Quantum Edge innersprings and U.S. Spring and strong growth in Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Aerospace. These improvements were partially offset by declines in other businesses, primarily Home Furniture, Fashion Bed and flooring products.
Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.26 from $2.14 in 2017.
Earnings from 2018 include the fourth quarter $0.23 per share reduction just mentioned and a third quarter $0.01 per share benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for a net reduction of $0.22 per share.
Full year 2017 earnings included a $0.32 per share net reduction primarily from cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Adjusted full year earnings per share increased 1% to $2.48. Adjusted EPS benefited from improved mental margins in our steel mill and higher sales.
These improvements were largely offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the lag associated with passing along ongoing inflation.
In 2018, we made some important strategic moves that should reinforce achievement of our long-term financial goals.
In January, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders, a leading global manufacturer of engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market. PHC is our first business in the hydraulic cylinder industry, a market we identified through our styles of competition analysis.
In November, we announced the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions, and we have completed the acquisition last month.
ECS is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. The purchase price was $1.25 billion and was financed through an expansion of our commercial paper program and the issuance of a $500 million 5-year term loan with our current bank group.
Through the ECS acquisition, we have gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology along with scale in the production of private label finished mattresses.
Our combined expertise in spring and foam technology make us the leading provider of differentiated products for the global bedding industry.
ECS's annualized sales for the fiscal year ended September 2018 were $611 million, and we expect ECS to add approximately $675 million to sales growth in 2019.
ECS is in our new Speciality Foams business unit within the Residential Products segment reporting to Perry.
As previously discussed, we continued an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses and initiated restructuring activity late last year.
Restructuring related charges in 2018 were $16 million, and we expect an additional $17 million of charges in 2019.
The restructuring activity should be substantially complete by the end of this year. 
In 2019, we expect these acquisitions and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and increased margins. Matt will discuss our guidance for the year later in the call.
Finally, the quarterly slide decks that we posted to the Investor Relations website contains unit growth rates for innerspring and boxspring pieces within our Residential Products segment. Because of content gains including strong growth of our Comfort Core innersprings and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we will stop reporting unit growth for innersprings and boxings. We will continue to provide dollar growth as we do for our other business units. With all -- I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

In 2018, we generated operating cash flow of $440 million, which, once again, included our typically strong fourth quarter cash flow performance. 
We continue to have a strong and sharp focus on working capital management, and we ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.6%.
We repatriated $141 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter bringing our full year total to $314 million.
In November, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend, a 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Our dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings was 60% for 2018 at the top of our target dividend payout range of 50% to 60%.
Beginning in 2019, in conjunction with the increasing leverage from the ECS acquisition, we announced a modest change in our dividend payout target to approximately 50% of adjusted earnings.
We expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. 
In Friday's closing price of $40.97, our current yield is 3.7%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
For the full year, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock at an average price of $43.10, and issued 1.2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises.
During the year, we acquired PHC and 2 small TL component operations.
We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities, primarily in Automotive and Bedding.
We increased the borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from $800 million to $1.2 billion in connection with the funding of the ECS transaction.
We ended the year with debt at 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. After completing the ECS acquisition in January, our debt levels increased as expected to approximately 3.5x.
We are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade, credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by temporarily suspending share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt.
We asses our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis.
Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
While our recent performance has not met this target, we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy and prudent use of capital will support achievement of our top third goal over time. 
Sales growth in 2019 will benefit significantly from the ECS acquisition. We also expect sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders, partially offset by planned declines in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, related to restructuring efforts and from less promotional activity in Adjustable Bed.
2019 sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year.
ECS should add approximately $675 million to sales.
In addition to ECS, same location sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%.
Earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related cost, therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate.
As we have previously stated, the ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS in 2019.
EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the nonreoccurrence of some valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019.
The impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and tax implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. We expect 2019 depreciation and amortization to approximate $210 million, net interest of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million.
Based upon this guidance framework, our 2019 full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. 
While we do not issue specific quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to be somewhat consistent across the quarters in 2019.
We expect adjusted margins in the first quarter to be lower than first quarter last year, in part due to the purchase accounting for acquired ECS inventory, and we expect year-over-year adjusted margins to be flat to slightly improving by the second half of the year.
Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2019. Capital expenditures should be near $195 million for the year and dividends should require $205 million of cash.
Our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings.
Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain: One, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases.
As previously stated, we will temporarily suspend share repurchases, reduce acquisition spending and prioritize debt repayment after organic growth in dividends. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

So we think the visibility that we have there, it really gives us a strong case to stand by our goal. For 2019, production is forecast to be up about 1% globally and about 0.6% in the major market.

We are moving aggressively and expect to complete the implementation largely by that -- into the first half of the year. So for '19 in that business, I think we do see some shrinkage of sales, think about it in terms of, like, mid-single-digits. But with increased -- significantly increased earnings power on that side.

We also had that occur amongst some of our major customer groups during the fourth quarter. And then, also we feel like, based on the conversations we've been having, that in preparation for the preliminary determination, the dumping duties, we saw a glut of dumped Chinese mattresses that have been exported into the U.S. And so as they work through that, we think probably through the first quarter something like that, that had an effect definitely on fourth quarter results. The other thing going back to Karl's comments on the effort to get in place of dumping order. With that delay, because of the government shut down being pushed out, we now feel like that somewhere around the end of February, product that is landed would be subject to a 90-day look back. And in a lot of cases that has a cooling effect because obviously an importer of record needs to understand their cost basis whenever they're importing product. So we still believe that somewhere around the end of May or somewhere along in there, we'll see that preliminary determination, hopefully it's favorable, and we'll repatriate to the U.S. product in place of some of that dumb product."

But first of all, don't be surprised, of course, that it reflects the ECS acquisition. And we have been very clearly stating that the sales expectation that will arrive from ECS this year is estimated to be $675 million.
You also recall reading that we anticipate fully that the EBITDA margin on that sales base will be higher than the company average. So you could do math there to see that EBITDA will be driving significantly higher from this 2018 level of $573 million that we just posted company-wide for Leggett before we owned ECS. Secondly, as you saw in the fourth quarter, once again, our working capital performance strongly ended the year. And I know both Mitch and Perry and certainly Karl are working hard to be able to not ride in at 12% range of working capital investment, which we did in most of 2018. We're working hard to make sure that improved performance of a pretty significant nature by the end of the year is sustained throughout 2019. That will naturally flush up a meaningful amount of cash. And otherwise, when you think about go further through the cash flow statement, the capital expenditure is pretty predictable. We talked about M&A dialing down significantly, share repurchases, same as Karl just mentioned. So that circa $550 million of operating cash flow is readily correlated to the higher earnings, ECS being part of the family, working capital concentration and focus, and really no surprise uses of cash on the operating side.

And as Wendy said, those TSR targets are longer term, and we feel very comfortable as we sit here today that we'll be in that range."

First, I would like to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. They are very much appreciated.
We are pleased with our 2018 operational performance, despite the challenges we faced in some of our businesses, most notably, Home Furniture and Fashion Bed.
Fourth quarter sales increased 6% to $1.05 billion on flat volume. Raw material related price increases, net of currency impact, added 3% to sales growth and acquisitions also added 3%.
Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. This includes several items outlined in yesterday's press release that amount to a $0.23 per share reduction in earnings.
Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 5% to $0.62 per share from $0.59 last year. This increase is primarily due to improved metal margins in our Steel Rod business.
In 2018, sales grew 8% to $4.3 billion, with organic sales up 6% from a combination of 3% volume growth and a 3% benefit from raw material related price increases and currency impact.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures completed in 2017, added 2% to sales growth. Whole year sales benefited from ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive, market share gains and continued shift to Comfort Core and Quantum Edge innersprings and U.S. Spring and strong growth in Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Aerospace. These improvements were partially offset by declines in other businesses, primarily Home Furniture, Fashion Bed and flooring products.
Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.26 from $2.14 in 2017.
Earnings from 2018 include the fourth quarter $0.23 per share reduction just mentioned and a third quarter $0.01 per share benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for a net reduction of $0.22 per share.
Full year 2017 earnings included a $0.32 per share net reduction primarily from cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Adjusted full year earnings per share increased 1% to $2.48. Adjusted EPS benefited from improved mental margins at our steel mill and higher sales.
These improvements were largely offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the lag associated with passing along ongoing inflation.
In 2018, we made some important strategic moves that should reinforce achievement of our long-term financial goals.
In January, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders, a leading global manufacturer of engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market. PHC is our first business in the hydraulic cylinder industry, a market we identified through our Styles of Competition analysis.
In November, we announced the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions, and we have completed the acquisition last month. ECS is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. The purchase price was $1.25 billion and was financed through an expansion of our commercial paper program and the issuance of a $500 million 5-year term loan with our current bank group.
Through the ECS acquisition, we have gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology along with scale in the production of private label finished mattresses. Our combined expertise in spring and foam technology make us the leading provider of differentiated products for the global bedding industry.
ECS's annualized sales for the fiscal year ended September 2018 were $611 million, and we expect ECS to add approximately $675 million to sales growth in 2019. ECS is in our new Speciality Foams business unit within the Residential Products segment reporting to Perry.
As previously discussed, we continued an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses and initiated restructuring activity late last year.
Restructuring related charges in 2018 were $16 million, and we expect an additional $17 million of charges in 2019. The restructuring activity should be substantially complete by the end of this year. 
In 2019, we expect these acquisitions and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and increased margins. Matt will discuss our guidance for the year later in the call.
Finally, the quarterly slide decks that we posted to the Investor Relations website contains unit growth rates for innerspring and boxspring pieces within our Residential Products segment. Because of content gains including strong growth of our Comfort Core innersprings and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we will stop reporting unit growth for innersprings and boxsprings. We will continue to provide dollar growth as we do for our other business units. With all -- I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

In 2018, we generated operating cash flow of $440 million, which, once again, included our typically strong fourth quarter cash flow performance. 
We continue to have a strong and sharp focus on working capital management, and we ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.6%.
We repatriated $141 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $314 million.
In November, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend, a 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Our dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings was 60% for 2018, at the top of our target dividend payout range of 50% to 60%.
Beginning in 2019, in conjunction with the increasing leverage from the ECS acquisition, we announced a modest change in our dividend payout target to approximately 50% of adjusted earnings.
We expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. 
At Friday's closing price of $40.97, our current yield is 3.7%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
For the full year, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock at an average price of $43.10, and issued 1.2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises.
During the year, we acquired PHC and 2 small geo component operations. We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities, primarily in Automotive and Bedding.
We increased the borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from $800 million to $1.2 billion in connection with the funding of the ECS transaction.
We ended the year with debt at 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. After completing the ECS acquisition in January, our debt levels increased as expected to approximately 3.5x.
We are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by temporarily suspending share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. While our recent performance has not met this target, we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy and prudent use of capital will support achievement of our top third goal over time. 
Sales growth in 2019 will benefit significantly from the ECS acquisition. We also expect sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders, partially offset by planned declines in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture related to restructuring efforts and from less promotional activity in Adjustable Bed.
2019 sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year.
ECS should add approximately $675 million to sales.  In addition to ECS, same location sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%.
Earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related cost. Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate.
As we have previously stated, the ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS in 2019.
EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the nonreoccurrence of some valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019, the impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and tax implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. We expect 2019 depreciation and amortization to approximate $210 million, net interest of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million.
Based upon this guidance framework, our 2019 full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. 
While we do not issue specific quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to be somewhat consistent across the quarters in 2019.
We expect adjusted margins in the first quarter to be lower than first quarter last year, in part due to the purchase accounting for acquired ECS inventory, and we expect year-over-year adjusted margins to be flat to slightly improving by the second half of the year.
Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2019. Capital expenditures should be near $195 million for the year and dividends should require $205 million of cash.
Our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings.
Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain: One, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases.
As previously stated, we will temporarily suspend share repurchases, reduce acquisition spending and prioritize debt repayment after organic growth in dividends. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

Of course, our Automotive business continues to perform really well, and our long-term outlook hasn't changed. Our strong pipeline of awarded future program continues to give us confidence in our goal of beating the vehicle production growth by 1,000 basis points. We've had double-digit increases in our new awards every year since I've been counting this since 2011; an overall CAGR of over 15% since that time. So we think the visibility that we have there, it really gives us a strong case to stand by our goal. For 2019, production is forecast to be up about 1% globally and about 0.6% in the major market. And we look at what we have net of coming online versus programs ending, we still feel confident in our double-digit target."

And we've been reducing overhead and operating cost and we'll look forward to further reduce excess capacity. I think you're starting to see that performance stabilize in the fourth quarter. We are moving aggressively and expect to complete the implementation largely by the end of the first half of the year. So for '19 in that business, I think we do see some shrinkage of sales, probably think about it in terms of, like, mid-single-digit. But with increased -- significantly increased earnings power on that side. On the Fashion Bed side, I think we'll see more significant sales declines as we continue to trim the product categories there and really focus on monetizing inventory. I would think about the sales decline there being closer in the 20% to 30% range with probably very little earnings impact."

So during the fourth quarter, Mattress Firm went through a -- where they -- a period of time where they liquidated some excessive inventories. We also had that occur amongst some of our major customer groups during the fourth quarter. And then also we feel like, based on the conversations we've been having, that in preparation for the preliminary determination of the dumping duties, we saw a glut of dumped Chinese mattresses that have been exported into the U.S. And so as they work through that, we think probably through the first quarter, something like that, that had an effect definitely on fourth quarter results. The other thing, going back to Karl's comments on the effort to get in place a dumping order, with that delay, because of the government shutdown being pushed out, we now feel like that somewhere around the end of February, product that is landed would be subject to a 90-day look-back. And in a lot of cases that has a cooling effect because obviously an importer of record needs to understand their cost basis whenever they're importing product. So we still believe that somewhere around the end of May or somewhere along in there, we'll see that preliminary determination, hopefully it's favorable, and we'll repatriate to the U.S. product in place of some of that dumped product."

But first of all, don't be surprised, of course, that it reflects the ECS acquisition. And we have been very clearly stating that the sales expectation that will arrive from ECS this year is estimated to be $675 million. You'll also recall reading that we anticipate fully that the EBITDA margin on that sales base will be higher than the company average. So you could do math there to see that EBITDA will be driving significantly higher from this 2018 level of $573 million that we just posted company-wide for Leggett before we owned ECS. Secondly, as you saw in the fourth quarter, once again our working capital performance strongly ended the year. And I know both Mitch and Perry and certainly Karl are working hard to be able to not ride in that 12% range of working capital investment, which we did most of 2018. We're working hard to make sure that improved performance of a pretty significant nature by the end of the year is sustained throughout 2019. That will naturally flush up a meaningful amount of cash. And otherwise, when you think about -- go further through the cash flow statement, the capital spending is pretty predictable. We talked about M&A dialing down significantly, share repurchases, same as Karl just mentioned. So that circa $550 million of operating cash flow is readily correlated to the higher earnings, ECS being part of the family, working capital concentration and focus, and really no surprise uses of cash on the operating side. And again, we feel very confident about that expectation you should use in your model."

First, I would like to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. They are very much appreciated.
We are pleased with our 2018 operational performance, despite the challenges we faced in some of our businesses, most notably, Home Furniture and Fashion Bed.
Fourth quarter sales increased 6% to $1.05 billion on flat volume. Raw material related price increases, net of currency impact, added 3% to sales growth and acquisitions also added 3%.
Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. This includes several items outlined in yesterday's press release that amount to a $0.23 per share reduction in earnings.
Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 5% to $0.62 per share from $0.59 last year. This increase is primarily due to improved metal margins in our Steel Rod business.
In 2018, sales grew 8% to $4.3 billion, with organic sales up 6% from a combination of 3% volume growth and a 3% benefit from raw material related price increases and currency impact.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures completed in 2017, added 2% to sales growth. Whole year sales benefited from ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive, market share gains and continued shift to Comfort Core and Quantum Edge innersprings and U.S. Spring and strong growth in Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Aerospace. These improvements were partially offset by declines in other businesses, primarily Home Furniture, Fashion Bed and flooring products.
Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.26 from $2.14 in 2017.
Earnings from 2018 include the fourth quarter $0.23 per share reduction just mentioned and a third quarter $0.01 per share benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for a net reduction of $0.22 per share.
Full year 2017 earnings included a $0.32 per share net reduction primarily from cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Adjusted full year earnings per share increased 1% to $2.48. Adjusted EPS benefited from improved mental margins at our steel mill and higher sales.
These improvements were largely offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the lag associated with passing along ongoing inflation.
In 2018, we made some important strategic moves that should reinforce achievement of our long-term financial goals.
In January, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders, a leading global manufacturer of engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market. PHC is our first business in the hydraulic cylinder industry, a market we identified through our Styles of Competition analysis.
In November, we announced the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions, and we have completed the acquisition last month. ECS is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. The purchase price was $1.25 billion and was financed through an expansion of our commercial paper program and the issuance of a $500 million 5-year term loan with our current bank group.
Through the ECS acquisition, we have gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology along with scale in the production of private label finished mattresses. Our combined expertise in spring and foam technology make us the leading provider of differentiated products for the global bedding industry.
ECS's annualized sales for the fiscal year ended September 2018 were $611 million, and we expect ECS to add approximately $675 million to sales growth in 2019. ECS is in our new Speciality Foams business unit within the Residential Products segment reporting to Perry.
As previously discussed, we continued an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses and initiated restructuring activity late last year.
Restructuring-related charges in 2018 were $16 million, and we expect an additional $17 million of charges in 2019. The restructuring activity should be substantially complete by the end of this year. 
In 2019, we expect these acquisitions and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and increased margins. Matt will discuss our guidance for the year later in the call.
Finally, the quarterly slide decks that we posted to the Investor Relations website contains unit growth rates for innerspring and boxspring pieces within our Residential Products segment. Because of content gains including strong growth of our Comfort Core innersprings and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we will stop reporting unit growth for innersprings and boxsprings. We will continue to provide dollar growth as we do for our other business units. With all -- I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

We continue to have a strong and sharp focus on working capital management, and we ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.6%.
We repatriated $141 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $314 million.
In November, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend, a 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Our dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings was 60% for 2018, at the top of our target dividend payout range of 50% to 60%.
Beginning in 2019, in conjunction with the increasing leverage from the ECS acquisition, we announced a modest change in our dividend payout target to approximately 50% of adjusted earnings.
We expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. 
At Friday's closing price of $40.97, our current yield is 3.7%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
For the full year, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock at an average price of $43.10, and issued 1.2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises.
During the year, we acquired PHC and 2 small geo component operations. We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities, primarily in Automotive and Bedding.
We increased the borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from $800 million to $1.2 billion in connection with the funding of the ECS transaction.
We ended the year with debt at 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. After completing the ECS acquisition in January, our debt levels increased as expected to approximately 3.5x.
We are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by temporarily suspending share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. While our recent performance has not met this target, we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy and prudent use of capital will support achievement of our top third goal over time. 
Sales growth in 2019 will benefit significantly from the ECS acquisition. We also expect sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders, partially offset by planned declines in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture related to restructuring efforts and from less promotional activity in Adjustable Bed.
2019 sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year.
ECS should add approximately $675 million to sales.  In addition to ECS, same location sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%.
Earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related cost. Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate.
As we have previously stated, the ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS in 2019.
EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the nonreoccurrence of some valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019, the impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and tax implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. We expect 2019 depreciation and amortization to approximate $210 million, net interest of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million.
Based upon this guidance framework, our 2019 full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. 
While we do not issue specific quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to be somewhat consistent across the quarters in 2019.
We expect adjusted margins in the first quarter to be lower than first quarter last year, in part due to the purchase accounting for acquired ECS inventory, and we expect year-over-year adjusted margins to be flat to slightly improving by the second half of the year.
Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2019. Capital expenditures should be near $195 million for the year and dividends should require $205 million of cash.
Our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings.
Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain: one, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases.
As previously stated, we will temporarily suspend share repurchases, reduce acquisition spending and prioritize debt repayment after organic growth in dividends. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

Of course, our Automotive business continues to perform really well, and our long-term outlook hasn't changed.

We've had double-digit increases in our new awards every year since I've been counting this since 2011; an overall CAGR of over 15% since that time. So we think the visibility that we have there, it really gives us a strong case to stand by our goal. For 2019, production is forecast to be up about 1% globally and about 0.6% in the major market. And we look at what we have net of coming online versus programs ending, we still feel confident in our double-digit target."

And we've been reducing overhead and operating cost and we'll look forward to further reduce excess capacity. I think you're starting to see that performance stabilize in the fourth quarter. We are moving aggressively and expect to complete the implementation largely by the end of the first half of the year. So for '19 in that business, I think we do see some shrinkage of sales, probably think about it in terms of, like, mid-single-digit. But with increased -- significantly increased earnings power on that side. On the Fashion Bed side, I think we'll see more significant sales declines as we continue to trim the product categories there and really focus on monetizing inventory. I would think about the sales decline there being closer in the 20% to 30% range with probably very little earnings impact."

Remember, that's just a steel grid structure, so that trade is a good trade. There's other things going on, in that there are fewer bed frames sold because of the advent of box beds and platform beds, when there's fewer boxsprings, there's -- fewer bed frames and boxsprings correlate.

We also had that occur amongst some of our major customer groups during the fourth quarter. And then also we feel like, based on the conversations we've been having, that in preparation for the preliminary determination of the dumping duties, we saw a glut of dumped Chinese mattresses that have been exported into the U.S. And so as they work through that, we think probably through the first quarter, something like that, that had an effect definitely on fourth quarter results. The other thing, going back to Karl's comments on the effort to get in place a dumping order, with that delay, because of the government shutdown being pushed out, we now feel like that somewhere around the end of February, product that is landed would be subject to a 90-day look-back. And in a lot of cases that has a cooling effect because obviously an importer of record needs to understand their cost basis whenever they're importing product. So we still believe that somewhere around the end of May or somewhere along in there, we'll see that preliminary determination, hopefully it's favorable, and we'll repatriate to the U.S. product in place of some of that dumped product."

With the growth of hybrid products, the numbers of box bed mattresses that were displayed in Las Vegas, really, it's very, very early, but the predictions that we made in our analysis of the strategies around Elite are proving true, in that we're seeing a lot of box beds that are being sold or marketed to conventional brick-and-mortar environments that -- very, very apparent in Las Vegas. We're also seeing significant increased conversation around specialty foams and the attributes of specialty foams in terms of heat dissipation. So we feel, again, admittedly early, we're always cautious, but thank goodness we've done that deal. And what a fantastic group of managers and employees in that business. Culturally, there's such an incredible connectivity that, frankly, we're blessed to have them on the team."

But first of all, don't be surprised, of course, that it reflects the ECS acquisition. And we have been very clearly stating that the sales expectation that will arrive from ECS this year is estimated to be $675 million. You'll also recall reading that we anticipate fully that the EBITDA margin on that sales base will be higher than the company average. So you could do math there to see that EBITDA will be driving significantly higher from this 2018 level of $573 million that we just posted company-wide for Leggett before we owned ECS. Secondly, as you saw in the fourth quarter, once again our working capital performance strongly ended the year. And I know both Mitch and Perry and certainly Karl are working hard to be able to not ride in that 12% range of working capital investment, which we did most of 2018. We're working hard to make sure that improved performance of a pretty significant nature by the end of the year is sustained throughout 2019. That will naturally flush up a meaningful amount of cash. And otherwise, when you think about -- go further through the cash flow statement, the capital spending is pretty predictable. We talked about M&A dialing down significantly, share repurchases, same as Karl just mentioned. So that circa $550 million of operating cash flow is readily correlated to the higher earnings, ECS being part of the family, working capital concentration and focus, and really no surprise uses of cash on the operating side. And again, we feel very confident about that expectation you should use in your model."

As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 12% to $1.16 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions of 13% was slightly offset by a 1% decline in organic s",504,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our first quarter call. 
As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 12% to $1.16 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions of 13% was slightly offset by a 1% decline in organic sales. Volume was down 3%. Market share and content gains led to growth in U.S. [ spring ] of 7%, but this was more than offset by our decision to exit the Fashion Bed business, softer demand in automotive and volume we chose to exit in our Home Furniture business. 
Raw material related selling price increases added 4% to organic sales but were partially offset by currency impact of 2%. 
First quarter earnings per share were $0.45. This included $6 million of restructuring related charges and $1 million of ECS transaction cost that amount to a $0.04 per share reduction in earnings. Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.49 per share, down $0.08 from $0.57 in the first quarter last year. 
Earnings benefited from improved mental margins in our Steel Rod business and the ECS acquisition, even after [ $14 ] million of purchase accounting charges. However, these increases were more than offset by declines in automotive, Fashion Bed, flooring products and Adjustable Bed as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
We remain excited about the ECS acquisition and the opportunities it brings. Demand for their proprietary specialty foams and downstream products is strong even while the U.S. Bedding industry continues to be impacted by unfavorably priced Chinese mattresses that are the subject of a pending antidumping matter. Since filing the dumping case with the U.S. International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce in September 2018, we have seen a notable increase in imported mattresses from China, which has impacted ECS's sales growth. We expect a preliminary decision on the dumping allegations by the Department of Commerce in late May. 
If duties are imposed, we expect our Bedding businesses along with the entire U.S. Bedding industry to benefit. 
As previously discussed, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses and initiated restructuring activity in the fourth quarter of last year. 
We are exiting low-margin business, reducing operating cost and eliminating excess capacity in Home Furniture. These activities should be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. 
In late March, we announced the closure of Fashion Bed, and expect to be out of that business by the end of the third quarter. 
We expect full year restructuring related charges of $17 million, $12 million of which is noncash. 
As a reminder, from last quarter's conference call, the quarterly slide decks we post to the Investor Relations website no longer contain unit growth rates of interest spring and boxspring pieces within our Residential Products segment. 
Because of content gains, including strong growth of our Comfort Core innerspring's and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."
30760,610755115,1712624,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of [ $30 ] million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. A decrease",758,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of [ $30 ] million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. A decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and inventory purchases, along with wind down activity at restructured locations, led to the increase in working capital investment. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 13.4%. That percentage should come back down as 2019 progresses. 
We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. In February, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 48 years. 
We fully expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. 
At Friday's closing price of $42.01, our current yield is 3.6%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
In keeping with our deleveraging plans, we repurchased only 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $42.38. These were primarily shares to enter buy employees for option exercises. We issued 1 million shares during the quarter, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
After completing the ECS acquisition in January, we ended the quarter with debt at 3.6x, our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA. We are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12-month's EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2020. 
We will do this by temporarily limiting share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. 
In addition, we expect to bring back roughly [ $170 ] million of offshore cash in 2019. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top [ 1/3 ] of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
We strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this [ top third ] goal over time. 
Our guidance for 2019 is unchanged. Full year sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year. ECS should add approximately $650 million to sales, commencing from the January 16th acquisition date, and we continue to expect annualized sales of approximately $675 million. 
In addition, organic sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%, reflecting sales growth in automotive, U.S. Spring, aerospace, hydraulic cylinders and Work Furniture, largely offset by our exit from Fashion Bed and planned declines in Home Furniture. 
Full year earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related costs. Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate. 
The ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS this year. EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the non-recurrence of valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019, the impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and cash implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. 
We expect full year depreciation and amortization of $210 million, net interest expense of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. 
As previously mentioned, full year cash from operations should approximate $550 million, capital expenditures should be approximately $195 million for the year, and dividends should require $205 million of cash. Our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. 
Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain: one, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases. 
As previously stated, we are prioritizing debt repayment after organic growth of dividends and as a result are temporarily limiting share repurchases and reducing acquisition spending. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

The surprises that we knew at the time of the acquisition that we were starting to see some chemical deflation so it's pressured selling prices a little bit but certainly not profitability and margins are enhanced as a percentage. So not a big surprise because TDI had increased significantly and now is coming back. So we're seeing deflation but it's for say, from profitability standpoint, it's not at all negative. The surprise probably has been the point that you started to make and that's the significant surge of dumped products in advance of the ruling that we expect will take place -- will take place by statutory rules, the end of May so there is a 90-day look back from a retro duty perspective. So we knew the product had come into the country before the end of February was in effect duty free but the significant surge of imports, 17 -- 71% in December, 63% in January, 56% in February, has surprised us that so it's dampened not only ECS's volume, certainly the whole U.S. industries volume. So it's impacted the conventional players in the U.S. as well. We expect that we'll start to get some relief. We -- the challenges, there's a lot of inventory in this country, it's being peeled off but it will take a while to also approved. So we're certainly optimistic about the duties and the duty rates. We are really pleased that we made the ECS acquisition. There is a lot of conversation, Perry's been involved with [indiscernible], who runs ECS and the rest of the ECS team and our historic betting group, about new programs of on shoring and re-shoring. Part of U.S. Spring's growth has been the growth of hybrids and boxed and in conventional platforms. So things are going really, really well. But those were kind of the 2 surprises."

But I can tell you as the quarter went along, the cadence got quicker and more robust. We actually saw in one of the other business units that's been affected as you've mentioned in carpet or in our flooring products group, we did see some headwinds at the start of the year. Some of that obviously construction related and weather impacted but as we've gone along now and we've entered into the second quarter, we've seen our business volumes there recover and we're bullish on that business as we go forward, now beginning to see some raw material relief there also."

As you probably recall that the vehicle production forecast has declined consistently since the middle of last year. In fact, vehicles are down, almost 2.8 million vehicles since the December forecast with over 2 million of those units coming out of the first half of the year. So we're looking at a forecast for the market that shows continued softness in the first half of the year with production down year-over-year, about 5% and then the forecast improves in the back half of the year with production increasing year-over-year 3% to 4% and that's pretty much -- that's reflective of the trends that we see as well. Remember that so we're facing pretty tough comps with the first half of last year being pretty strong and then falling off in the back half. So we'll expect to see a reverse of that this year. In PHD, in the hydraulic cylinders market, yes, last year was very strong. I think year to growth in material handling was up nearly 15%. Q1 was actually a little bit softer, down about 3%. We don't have good industry focus there so -- unit pressure remained strong but we'll keep an eye out for that. Aerospace bills remain strong so we're in good shape there as well."

Certainly retaliatory tariffs in China have reduced demand for inputs there. The continued steel and aluminum tariffs are raising transaction prices in the U.S. slowing sales and those are really coming through lower incentives that the consumers having to absorb. And then we also had the WLTP emissions testing backlog last year and I think it's starting to work itself out but people expect will be in better position in the second half of the year. And then I think finally, there's some expectation that there'll be tax incentives in China that will help boost demand in the second half of 2019. So I think that part of the year-over-year negative reflection in the first half is that it was really strong in '18 and we see it softer in '19 and yes, the reverse scenario so I don't think that production rates that are forecast in the back half are unrealistic."

And then actually wanted to pivot the next question back to Karl around ECS and I certainly agree with the acceleration of Chinese imports but my impression was that the imports are trying to get ahead of potential duties so that they would have inventory in place to last potentially through Q2. Not as a demand accelerant and we haven't seen much pricing change on import pricing at least that we see online.

So it's the growth that really started in 2016 and the acceleration of that growth continues to pressure the entry price points in the U.S, which the first quarter is heavily sensitive to that seasonality. So there's a continuation of a loss of business to imports. So I fundamentally agree with your point that it's just -- it's an acceleration, the inventory is a bigger issue from a go forward perspective that we expect will be melted off probably sometime by the end -- middle, the end of the third quarter as it will be interesting to see what the import statistics for March look like but short answer is, it's a continued pressure on the entry price points in the U.S. And from our perspective, and from an ECS perspective, there had been a lot of conversation, it continues to be a lot of conversation of the domestic players moving to U.S. sourcing, some of them are reassuring, a good part of them are on-shoring for the first time and as that inventory continues to grow, the start of those ECS programs gets pushed out. So there is a backward forecast at ECS that we think is appropriate and they'll also be an impact, a kind of knock on benefit to our conventional U.S. spring business and as I said in the prepared comments to the U.S. Bedding industry as a whole."

Fashion Bed had been distributed to some smaller retailers Adjustable Bed's but it just wasn't economical for us to continue to do that given the decline in the other Fashion Bed been product categories. 2018 was really volatile with really strong sales based on heavy progressional activity in the first half of the year and then a slower second half of the year. So this definitely presents challenging comps for us in 2019. I think we see, without that heavy promotional activity, we see 2019 volume probably down somewhere in the mid-single digits. So you're right, there continues to growth in the industry at -- strong growth at really lower entry level price points. We tend to play at little bit higher price points."

So we'll go business unit by business unit, organized by segment. U.S. Spring, you saw 7% growth, we expect that to continue. Certainly the Bedding industry was impacted in January and February to Perry's comments by weather. But there is an acceleration of our content gains, market share pickup, hybrids are a contributor to that. We expect dumping benefit in certainly in the back half in U.S. Spring so everything's really going well in U.S. Spring. I made the comments on ECS. We expect their back half business to significantly improve. International Spring performed well in the first quarter, we expect that to continue, there's a story by geography. Perry made a comment on flooring significantly negatively impacted in January, February. I think that's highly correlated to weather. Saw a gain in March, we expect kind of flat for the whole year there. Fabric converting highly correlated to Bedding and furniture, for the full year, we expect flat. Geo because of acquisitions, we expect 20% growth in that business and machinery is relatively small, it will be flat to slightly down because the softness in the U.S. Bedding industry. Industrial, you saw a negative in the first quarter that was caused by our closure of a formed wire business that anniversaries actually next week so it cost in the first quarter about $10 million of volume. So that negative will not repeat in the remainder of the year. Echoing some of Mitch's comments, Work Furniture, we expect mid-single digit growth for the year. Home Furniture should be flat with units down, dollars up because of the benefit of pricing actions that we're taking in the back half of last year. Mitch spoke to the impact of that [ FDG ] closure and adjustable beds, auto for the year should be up mid-to high single digits. Aerospace and hydraulic cylinders both up in about 10% range. So we feel really good about our guidance. I will admit that the sales guidance is probably more questionable than the EPS guidance but we're -- as we sit here, end of April, we feel pretty good. We feel real good about our guidance."

If you look year-on-year and then the other layer on content gains is not only the shift from Open Core to Comfort Core but the Quantum Edge part of the story and that was 43% of all the Comfort Core that we shift in Q1 had a Quantum Edge element to it. So what do we attribute that to you? I think it's a variety of things but there' is clearly a preference in the mid buying to premium categories of Comfort Core. And also in the box bed category. We're seeing continued penetration and expect that to go even further in the future. Quantum Edge is so prevalent and becoming so prevalent in box beds because the product itself is so good. It just makes sense. Our customers see the benefits of that product and that it opens up and it has from the start from the opening process, an enhanced edge prior to that most of the phone products and a lot of the inner spring products had no support on the edge.

We think a lot of it gets repatriated to the U.S. and we're seeing our quote process in both amongst traditional customers and the box bed part of the business would indicate that there's a lot of that going to re shore and it's a tremendous opportunity for us and for the industry. And that's the reason for the filing. If you look at the schedule, as we know it today, around the end of May, commerce will make a preliminary determination of duties if those are favorable, there's also amongst the petitioners been a filing to have some proactive element applied to those duties and that would be a 90-day look back if it's approved. We don't know for sure that it will be but it has -- we believe will put a cooling effect on all of that importation. We think it already has and if you look at a 90-day look back from the end of May, that's the end of February. So it will be interesting to see what the March numbers look like when we finally see those. But we expect the level of importation to certainly decelerate and to the degree of how quickly that happens, I don't know. But I think that the word is out.

As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 12% to $1.16 billion.

As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 12% to $1.16 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions of 13% was slightly offset by a 1% decline in organic sales. Volume was down 3%. Market share and content gains led to growth in U.S. Spring of 7%, but this was more than offset by our decision to exit the Fashion Bed business, softer demand in automotive and volume we chose to exit in our Home Furniture business. 
Raw material-related selling price increases added 4% to organic sales but were partially offset by currency impact of 2%. 
First quarter earnings per share were $0.45. This included $6 million of restructuring-related charges and $1 million of ECS transaction cost that amount to a $0.04 per share reduction in earnings. Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.49 per share, down $0.08 from $0.57 in the first quarter last year. 
Earnings benefited from improved mental margins in our Steel Rod business and the ECS acquisition, even after $14 million of purchase accounting charges. However, these increases were more than offset by declines in automotive, Fashion Bed, flooring products and Adjustable Bed, as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
We remain excited about the ECS acquisition and the opportunities it brings. Demand for their proprietary specialty foams and downstream products is strong even while the U.S. Bedding industry continues to be impacted by unfavorably priced Chinese mattresses that are the subject of a pending antidumping matter. Since filing the dumping case with the U.S. International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce in September 2018, we have seen a notable increase in imported mattresses from China, which has impacted ECS's sales growth. We expect a preliminary decision on the dumping allegations by the Department of Commerce in late May. 
If duties are imposed, we expect our Bedding businesses along with the entire U.S. Bedding industry to benefit. 
As previously discussed, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses and initiated restructuring activity in the fourth quarter of last year. 
We are exiting low-margin business, reducing operating cost and eliminating excess capacity in Home Furniture. These activities should be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. 
In late March, we announced the closure of Fashion Bed, and expect to be out of that business by the end of the third quarter. 
We expect full year restructuring-related charges of $17 million, $12 million of which is noncash. 
As a reminder, from last quarter's conference call, the quarterly slide decks we post to the Investor Relations website no longer contain unit growth rates of innerspring and boxspring pieces within our Residential Products segment. 
Because of content gains, including strong growth of our Comfort Core innersprings and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."
30760,610755115,1712903,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $30 million versus in the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. A decrease",747,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $30 million versus in the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. A decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and inventory purchases, along with wind-down activity at restructured locations, led to the increase in working capital investment. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 13.4%. That percentage should come back down as 2019 progresses. 
We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. In February, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 48 years. 
We fully expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. 
At Friday's closing price of $42.01, our current yield is 3.6%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
In keeping with our deleveraging plans, we repurchased only 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $42.38. These were primarily shares driven by employees for option exercises. We issued 1 million shares during the quarter, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
After completing the ECS acquisition in January, we ended the quarter with debt at 3.6x, our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA. We are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt-to-trailing 12-month's EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2020. 
We will do this by temporarily limiting share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. 
In addition, we expect to bring back roughly $170 million of offshore cash in 2019. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
We strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this top third goal over time. 
Our guidance for 2019 is unchanged. Full year sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year. ECS should add approximately $650 million to sales, commencing from the January 16 acquisition date, and we continue to expect annualized sales of approximately $675 million. 
In addition, organic sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%, reflecting sales growth in automotive, U.S. Spring, aerospace, hydraulic cylinders and Work Furniture, largely offset by our exit from Fashion Bed and planned declines in Home Furniture. 
Full year earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring-related costs. Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate. 
The ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS this year. EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the non-recurrence of valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019, the impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and cash implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. 
We expect full year depreciation and amortization of $210 million, net interest expense of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. 
As previously mentioned, full year cash from operations should approximate $550 million, capital expenditures should be approximately $195 million for the year, and dividends should require $205 million of cash. Our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. 
Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain: one, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases. 
As previously stated, we are prioritizing debt repayment after organic growth of dividends and as a result are temporarily limiting share repurchases and reducing acquisition spending. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

The surprises that we knew at the time of the acquisition that we were starting to see some chemical deflation so it's pressured selling prices a little bit but certainly not profitability and margins are enhanced as a percentage. So not a big surprise because TDI had increased significantly and now is coming back. So we're seeing deflation but it's -- for -- like I said, from profitability standpoint, it's not at all negative. The surprise probably has been the point that you started to make and that's the significant surge of dumped products in advance of the ruling that we expect will take place by statutory rules, the end of May, so there is a 90-day look back from a retro duty perspective. So we knew the product that had come into the country before the end of February was in effect duty-free but the significant surge of imports, 17% -- 71% in December, 63% in January, 56% in February, has surprised us, so it's dampened not only ECS' volume, certainly the whole U.S. industries volume. So it's impacted the conventional players in the U.S. as well. We expect that we'll start to get some relief. We -- the challenges, there's a lot of inventory in this country, it's being peeled off but it will take a while to also approve. So we're certainly optimistic about the duties and the duty rates. We are really pleased that we've made the ECS acquisition. There is a lot of conversation, Perry's been involved with [ Chris Christofides ], who runs ECS and the rest of the ECS team and our historic Bedding group, about new programs of onshoring and re-shoring. Part of U.S. Spring's growth has been the growth of hybrids and boxed and in conventional platforms. So things are going really, really well. But those were kind of the 2 surprises."

But I can tell you as the quarter went along, the cadence got quicker and more robust. We actually saw in one of the other business units that's been affected as you've mentioned in carpet or in our flooring products group, we did see some headwinds at the start of the year. Some of that obviously construction-related and weather-impacted but as we've gone along now and we've entered into the second quarter, we've seen our business volumes there recover, and we're bullish on that business as we go forward, now beginning to see some raw material relief there also."

As you probably recall that the vehicle production forecast has declined consistently since the middle of last year. In fact, vehicles are down, almost 2.8 million vehicles since the December forecast with over 2 million of those units coming out of the first half of the year. So we're looking at a forecast for the market that shows continued softness in the first half of the year with production down year-over-year, about 5%, and then the forecast improves in the back half of the year with production increasing year-over-year 3% to 4%, and that's pretty much -- that's reflective of the trends that we see as well. Remember that so we're facing pretty tough comps with the first half of last year being pretty strong and then falling off in the back half. So we'll expect to see a reverse of that this year. In PHC, in the hydraulic cylinders market, yes, last year was very strong. I think year to growth in material handling was up nearly 15%. Q1 was actually a little bit softer, down about 3%. We don't have good industry forecast there so -- unit pressure remained strong but we'll keep an eye out for that. Aerospace bills remain strong so we're in good shape there as well."

Certainly retaliatory tariffs in China have reduced demand for inputs there. The continued steel and aluminum tariffs are raising transaction prices in U.S. slowing sales and those are really coming through lower incentives that the consumers having to absorb. And then we also had the WLTP emissions testing backlog last year and I think it's starting to work itself out but people expect we'll be in better position in the second half of the year. And then I think finally, there's some expectation that there'll be tax incentives in China that will help boost demand in the second half of 2019. So I think that part of the year-over-year negative reflection in the first half is that it was really strong in '18, and we see it softer in '19 and yes, the reversed scenario, so I don't think that production rates that are forecast in the back half are unrealistic."

And then actually wanted to pivot the next question back to Karl around ECS, and I certainly agree with the acceleration of Chinese imports but my impression was that the imports are trying to get ahead of potential duties so that they would have inventory in place to last potentially through Q2. Not as a demand accelerant and we haven't seen much pricing change on import pricing at least that we see online. So I guess the core of my question is, why would the acceleration of imports be impacting overall demand trends as it relates to ECS?"

So it's the growth that really started in 2016, and the acceleration of that growth continues to pressure the entry price points in the U.S, which the first quarter is heavily sensitive to that seasonality. So there's a continuation of a loss of business to imports. So Peter, I fundamentally agree with your point that it's just -- it's an acceleration, the inventory is a bigger issue from a go-forward perspective that we expect will be melted off probably sometime by the end -- middle, the end of the third quarter as it will be interesting to see what the import statistics for March look like but short answer is, it's a continued pressure on the entry price points in the U.S. And from our perspective, and from an ECS perspective, there had been a lot of conversation and continues to be a lot of conversation of the domestic players moving to U.S. sourcing, some of them are re-shoring, a good part of them are onshoring for the first time and as that inventory continues to grow, the start of those ECS programs gets pushed out. So there is a backward forecast at ECS that we think is appropriate and there'll also be an impact, a kind of knock-on benefit to our conventional U.S. Spring business and as I said in the prepared comments, to the U.S. Bedding industry as a whole."

Fashion Bed had been ready to distribute to some smaller retailers Adjustable Beds, but it just wasn't economical for us to continue to do that given the decline in the other Fashion Bed product categories. 2018 was really volatile with really strong sales based on heavy progressional activity in the first half of the year and then a slower second half of the year.

So we'll go business unit by business unit, organized by segment. U.S. Spring, you saw 7% growth, we expect that to continue. Certainly the Bedding industry was impacted in January and February to Perry's comments by weather. But there is an acceleration of our content gains, market share pickup, hybrids are a contributor to that. We expect dumping benefit in the -- certainly in the back half in U.S. Spring, so everything's really going well in U.S. Spring. I made the comments on ECS. We expect their back half business to significantly improve. International Spring performed well in the first quarter, we expect that to continue, there's a story by geography. Perry made a comment on flooring significantly negatively impacted in January, February. I think that's highly correlated to weather. Saw a gain in March, we expect kind of flat for the whole year there. Fabric converting highly correlated to Bedding and furniture, for the full year, we expect flat. Geo because of acquisitions, we expect 20% growth in that business and machinery is relatively small, it will be flat to slightly down because of the softness in the U.S. Bedding industry. Industrial, you saw a negative in the first quarter that was caused by our closure of a Formed Wire business that anniversary is actually next week, so it costs in the first quarter about $10 million of volume. So that negative will not repeat in the remainder of the year. Echoing some of Mitch's comments, Work Furniture, we expect mid-single digit growth for the year. Home Furniture should be flat with units down, dollars up because of the benefit of pricing actions that we're taking in the back half of last year. Mitch spoke to the impact of that FBG closure and Adjustable Beds, auto for the year should be up mid-to high-single digits. Aerospace and hydraulic cylinders both up in about 10% range. So we feel really good about our guidance. I will admit that the sales guidance is probably more questionable than the EPS guidance but we're -- as we sit here, end of April, we feel pretty good. We feel real good about our guidance."

Well, in the first quarter this year, Comfort Core was actually at 50% of the units sold, is up about 24%, if you look year-on-year and then the other layer on content gains is not only the shift from Open Coil to Comfort Core but the Quantum Edge part of the story and that was 43% of all the Comfort Core that we shift in Q1, it had a Quantum Edge element to it. So what do we attribute that to? I think it's a variety of things but there is clearly a preference in the mid buying to premium categories of Comfort Core. And also in the box bed category. We're seeing continued penetration and expect that to go even further in the future. Quantum Edge is so prevalent and becoming so prevalent in box beds because the product itself is so good. It just makes sense. Our customers see the benefits of that product and that it opens up and it has from the start, from the opening process, an enhanced edge prior to that most of the phone products and a lot of the innerspring products had no support on the edge. This product does, it's got integrity and it stays through the life of the mattress. So we're excited about that.

If you think there are 7 million, 8 million mattresses, the run rate that was coming from China, some of that goes elsewhere around the world obviously. We think a lot of it gets repatriated to the U.S. and we're seeing our quote process in both amongst traditional customers and the box bed part of the business would indicate that there's a lot of that going to re-shore and it's a tremendous opportunity for us and for the industry. And that's the reason for the filing. If you look at the schedule, as we know it today, around the end of May, commerce will make a preliminary determination of duties if those are favorable, there's also amongst the petitioners been filing to have some proactive element applied to those duties and that would be a 90-day look back if it's approved. We don't know for sure that it will be but it has -- we believe will put a cooling effect on all of that importation. We think it already has and if you look at a 90-day look back from the end of May, that's the end of February. So it will be interesting to see what the March numbers look like when we finally see those. But we expect the level of importation to certainly decelerate and to the degree of how quickly that happens, I don't know. But I think that the word is out. I think from all indications, we would look for a positive finding at the end of May and that begins to flow through, will there be cloud of product still sitting out there all through the second quarter, don't know, could be. It's just hard to know where those sit."

And at both the ECS level and the historical Leggett level, and again, hard to quantify. But there's an expectation that whatever percentage of those 8 million-ish units come back, a higher percentage of them will be Hybrid than our currently foam today. So we're excited, mostly because of conversation with customers. You would know that Casper launched on their website a Hybrid effective 2 weeks ago. So that's new. They and other customers are talking about Hybrids where it historically had been foams.  So the combination of our Comfort Core and the exclusive materials from ECS are really, really powerful."

As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 12% to $1.16 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions of 13% was slightly offset by a 1% decline in organic sales. Volume was down 3%. Market share and content gains led to growth in U.S. Spring of 7%, but this was more than offset by our decision to exit the Fashion Bed business, softer demand in Automotive and volume we chose to exit in our Home Furniture business. 
Raw material-related selling price increases added 4% to organic sales but were partially offset by currency impact of 2%. 
First quarter earnings per share were $0.45. This included $6 million of restructuring-related charges and $1 million of ECS transaction cost that amount to a $0.04 per share reduction in earnings. Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.49 per share, down $0.08 from $0.57 in the first quarter last year. 
Earnings benefited from improved metal margins in our Steel Rod business and the ECS acquisition, even after $14 million of purchase accounting charges. However, these increases were more than offset by declines in Automotive, Fashion Bed, Flooring Products and Adjustable Bed, as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
We remain excited about the ECS acquisition and the opportunities it brings. Demand for their proprietary specialty foams and downstream products is strong, even while the U.S. Bedding industry continues to be impacted by unfavorably priced Chinese mattresses that are the subject of a pending antidumping matter. Since filing the dumping case with the U.S. International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce in September 2018, we have seen a notable increase in imported mattresses from China, which has impacted ECS's sales growth. We expect a preliminary decision on the dumping allegations by the Department of Commerce in late May. 
If duties are imposed, we expect our Bedding businesses along with the entire U.S. Bedding industry to benefit. 
As previously discussed, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses and initiated restructuring activity in the fourth quarter of last year. 
We are exiting low-margin business, reducing operating cost and eliminating excess capacity in Home Furniture. These activities should be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. 
In late March, we announced the closure of Fashion Bed, and expect to be out of that business by the end of the third quarter. 
We expect full year restructuring-related charges of $17 million, $12 million of which is noncash. 
As a reminder, from last quarter's conference call, the quarterly slide decks we post to the Investor Relations website no longer contain unit growth rates of innerspring and boxspring pieces within our Residential Products segment. 
Because of content gains, including strong growth of our Comfort Core innersprings and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."
30760,610755115,1713202,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $13 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. A decrease in",746,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $13 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. A decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and inventory purchases, along with wind-down activity at restructured locations, led to the increase in working capital investment. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 13.4%. That percentage should come back down as 2019 progresses. 
We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. In February, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 48 years. 
We fully expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. 
At Friday's closing price of $42.01, our current yield is 3.6%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
In keeping with our deleveraging plans, we repurchased only 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $42.38. These were primarily shares surrendered by employees for option exercises. We issued 1 million shares during the quarter, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
After completing the ECS acquisition in January, we ended the quarter with debt at 3.6x, our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA. We are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt-to-trailing 12-month's EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2020. 
We will do this by temporarily limiting share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. 
In addition, we expect to bring back roughly $170 million of offshore cash in 2019. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
We strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this top third goal over time. 
Our guidance for 2019 is unchanged. Full year sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year. ECS should add approximately $650 million to sales, commencing from the January 16 acquisition date, and we continue to expect annualized sales of approximately $675 million. 
In addition, organic sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%, reflecting sales growth in automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace, Hydraulic Cylinders and Work Furniture, largely offset by our exit from Fashion Bed and planned declines in Home Furniture. 
Full year earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring-related costs. Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate. 
The ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS this year. EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the non-recurrence of valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019, the impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and cash implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. 
We expect full year depreciation and amortization of $210 million, net interest expense of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. 
As previously mentioned, full year cash from operations should approximate $550 million, capital expenditures should be approximately $195 million for the year, and dividends should require $205 million of cash. Our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. 
Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain: one, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases. 
As previously stated, we are prioritizing debt repayment after organic growth of dividends and as a result are temporarily limiting share repurchases and reducing acquisition spending. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

The surprise is that we knew at the time of the acquisition that we were starting to see some chemical deflation so it's pressured selling prices a little bit but certainly not profitability and margins are enhanced as a percentage. So not a big surprise because TDI had increased significantly and now is coming back. So we're seeing deflation but it's -- for -- like I said, from profitability standpoint, it's not at all negative. The surprise probably has been the point that you started to make and that's the significant surge of dumped products in advance of the ruling that we expect will take place by statutory rules, the end of May, so there is a 90-day look back from a retro duty perspective. So we knew the product that had come into the country before the end of February was in effect duty-free but the significant surge of imports, 17% -- 71% in December, 63% in January, 56% in February, has surprised us, so it's dampened not only ECS' volume, certainly the whole U.S. industries volume. So it's impacted the conventional players in the U.S. as well. We expect that we'll start to get some relief. We -- the challenge is there's a lot of inventory in this country, it's being peeled off but it will take a while to all sort through. So we're certainly optimistic about the duties and the duty rates. We are really pleased that we've made the ECS acquisition. There is a lot of conversation, Perry's been involved with Chris Chrisafides, who runs ECS and the rest of the ECS team and our historic Bedding group, about new programs of onshoring and reshoring. Part of U.S. Spring's growth has been the growth of hybrids and boxed and in conventional platforms. So things are going really, really well. But those were kind of the 2 surprises."

But I can tell you as the quarter went along, the cadence got quicker and more robust. We actually saw in one of the other business units that's been affected as you've mentioned in carpet or in our Flooring Products group, we did see some headwinds at the start of the year. Some of that obviously construction-related and weather-impacted but as we've gone along now and we've entered into the second quarter, we've seen our business volumes there recover, and we're bullish on that business as we go forward.

As you probably recall that the vehicle production forecast has declined consistently since the middle of last year. In fact, vehicles are down almost about 2.8 million vehicles since the December forecast with over 2 million of those units coming out of the first half of the year. So we're looking at a forecast for the market that shows continued softness in the first half of the year with production down year-over-year, about 5%, and then the forecast improves in the back half of the year with production increasing year-over-year 3% to 4%, and that's pretty much -- that's reflective of the trends that we see as well. Remember that so we're facing pretty tough comps with the first half of last year being pretty strong and then falling off in the back half. So we'll expect to see a reverse of that this year. In PHC, in the Hydraulic Cylinders market, yes, last year was very strong. I think year to growth in material handling was up nearly 15%. Q1 was actually a little bit softer, down about 3%. We don't have good industry forecast there so -- unit pressure remained strong but we'll keep an eye out for that. Aerospace bills remain strong so we're in good shape there as well."

Certainly retaliatory tariffs in China have reduced demand for inputs there. The continued steel and aluminum tariffs are raising transaction prices in the U.S. slowing sales and those are really coming through lower incentives that the consumer's having to absorb. And then we also had the WLTP emissions testing backlog last year, and I think it's starting to work itself out but people expect we'll be in better position in the second half of the year. And then I think finally, there's some expectation that there'll be tax incentives in China that will help boost demand in the second half of 2019. So I think that part of the year-over-year negative reflection in the first half is that it was really strong in '18, and we see it softer in '19 and yes, the reverse scenario, so I don't think that production rates that are forecast in the back half are unrealistic."

That's helpful. And then I actually wanted to pivot the next question back to Karl around ECS, and I certainly agree with the acceleration of Chinese imports but my impression was that the imports are trying to get ahead of potential duties so that they would have inventory in place to last potentially through Q2. Not as a demand accelerant and we haven't seen much pricing change on import pricing at least that we see online. So I guess the core of my question is, why would the acceleration of imports be impacting overall demand trends as it relates to ECS?"

So it's the growth that really started in 2016, and the acceleration of that growth continues to pressure the entry price points in the U.S, which the first quarter is heavily sensitive to that seasonality. So there's a continuation of a loss of business to imports. So Peter, I fundamentally agree with your point that it's just -- it's an acceleration, the inventory is a bigger issue from a go-forward perspective that we expect will be melted off probably sometime by the end -- middle, the end of the third quarter as it will be interesting to see what the import statistics for March look like but short answer is, it's a continued pressure on the entry price points in the U.S. And from our perspective, and from an ECS perspective, there had been a lot of conversation and continues to be a lot of conversation of the domestic players moving to U.S. sourcing, some of them are reshoring, a good part of them are onshoring for the first time and as that inventory continues to grow, the start of those ECS programs gets pushed out. So there is a backward forecast at ECS that we think is appropriate and there'll also be an impact, a kind of knock-on benefit to our conventional U.S. Spring business and as I said in the prepared comments, to the U.S. Bedding industry as a whole."

So this definitely presents challenging comps for us in 2019. I think we see, without that heavy promotional activity, we see 2019 volume probably down somewhere in the mid-single digits.

I'm going to give you and everyone listening kind of a quick view of each business unit. So we'll go business unit by business unit, organized by segment. U.S. Spring, you saw 7% growth, we expect that to continue. Certainly the Bedding industry was impacted in January and February, to Perry's comments by weather. But there is an acceleration of our content gains, market share pickup, hybrids are a contributor to that. We expect dumping benefit in the -- certainly in the back half in U.S. Spring, so everything's really going well in U.S. Spring. I made the comments on ECS. We expect their back half business to significantly improve. International Spring performed well in the first quarter, we expect that to continue, there's a story by geography. Perry made a comment on flooring significantly negatively impacted in January, February. I think that's highly correlated to weather. Saw a gain in March, we expect kind of flat for the whole year there. Fabric converting highly correlated to Bedding and furniture, for the full year, we expect flat. Geo because of acquisitions, we expect 20% growth in that business and machinery is relatively small, it will be flat to slightly down because of the softness in the U.S. Bedding industry. Industrial, you saw a negative in the first quarter that was caused by our closure of a Formed Wire business that anniversary is actually next week, so it costs in the first quarter about $10 million of volume. So that negative will not repeat in the remainder of the year. Echoing some of Mitch's comments, Work Furniture, we expect mid-single digit growth for the year. Home Furniture should be flat with units down, dollars up because of the benefit of pricing actions that we're taking in the back half of last year. Mitch spoke to the impact of that FBG closure and Adjustable Beds, Auto for the year should be up mid- to high single digits. Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders both up in about 10% range. So we feel really good about our guidance. I will admit that the sales guidance is probably more questionable than the EPS guidance but we're -- as we sit here, end of April, we feel pretty good.

First quarter, we used to talk about -- I was -- I thought that Comfort Core as a percent of the units that we sold likely would top out somewhere in the mid-40s as a percentage range. Well, in the first quarter this year, Comfort Core was actually at 50% of the units sold, is up about 24%, if you look year-on-year. And then the other layer on content gains is not only the shift from Open Coil to Comfort Core but the Quantum Edge part of the story, and that was 43% of all the Comfort Core that we shipped in Q1 had a Quantum Edge element to it. So what do we attribute that to? I think it's a variety of things, but there is clearly a preference in the mid buying to premium categories of Comfort Core. And also in the box bed category. We're seeing continued penetration and expect that to go even further in the future. Quantum Edge is so prevalent and becoming so prevalent in box beds because the product itself is so good. It just makes sense. Our customers see the benefits of that product and that it opens up and it has from the start, from the opening process, an enhanced edge prior to that most of the foam products and a lot of the innerspring products had no support on the edge. This product does, it's got integrity and it stays through the life of the mattress. So we're excited about that. And again, all those products as they get sold through, that's additional volume for us and it's an additional opportunities for margin and it makes a great product."

If you think there are 7 million, 8 million mattresses, the run rate that was coming from China, some of that goes elsewhere around the world obviously. We think a lot of it gets repatriated to the U.S. and we're seeing our quote process in both amongst traditional customers and the box bed part of the business would indicate that there's a lot of that going to reshore and it's a tremendous opportunity for us and for the industry. And that's the reason for the filing. If you look at the schedule, as we know it today, around the end of May, commerce will make a preliminary determination of duties if those are favorable, there's also amongst the petitioners been filing to have some proactive element applied to those duties and that would be a 90-day look back if it's approved. We don't know for sure that it will be but it has -- we believe will put a cooling effect on all of that importation. We think it already has and if you look at a 90-day look back from the end of May, that's the end of February. So it will be interesting to see what the March numbers look like when we finally see those. But we expect the level of importation to certainly decelerate and to the degree of how quickly that happens, I don't know. But I think that the word is out. I think from all indications, we would look for a positive finding at the end of May and that begins to flow through, will there be a glut of product still sitting out there all through the second quarter, don't know, could be.

So we're excited, mostly because of conversation with customers. You would know that Casper launched on their website a Hybrid effective 2 weeks ago. So that's new. They and other customers are talking about Hybrids where it historically had been foam.  So the combination of our Comfort Core and the exclusive materials from ECS are really, really powerful."

As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 12% to $1.16 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions of 13% was slightly offset by a 1% decline in organic sales. Volume was down 3%. Market share and content gains led to growth in U.S. Spring of 7%, but this was more than offset by our decision to exit the Fashion Bed business, softer demand in Automotive and volume we chose to exit in our Home Furniture business. 
Raw material-related selling price increases added 4% to organic sales but were partially offset by currency impact of 2%. 
First quarter earnings per share were $0.45. This included $6 million of restructuring-related charges and $1 million of ECS transaction cost that amount to a $0.04 per share reduction in earnings. Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.49 per share, down $0.08 from $0.57 in the first quarter last year. 
Earnings benefited from improved metal margins in our Steel Rod business and the ECS acquisition, even after $14 million of purchase accounting charges. However, these increases were more than offset by declines in Automotive, Fashion Bed, Flooring Products and Adjustable Bed, as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
We remain excited about the ECS acquisition and the opportunities it brings. Demand for their proprietary specialty foams and downstream products is strong, even while the U.S. Bedding industry continues to be impacted by unfavorably priced Chinese mattresses that are the subject of a pending antidumping matter. Since filing the dumping case with the U.S. International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce in September 2018, we have seen a notable increase in imported mattresses from China, which has impacted ECS's sales growth. We expect a preliminary decision on the dumping allegations by the Department of Commerce in late May. 
If duties are imposed, we expect our Bedding businesses along with the entire U.S. Bedding industry to benefit. 
As previously discussed, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses and initiated restructuring activity in the fourth quarter of last year. 
We are exiting low-margin business, reducing operating cost and eliminating excess capacity in Home Furniture. These activities should be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. 
In late March, we announced the closure of Fashion Bed, and expect to be out of that business by the end of the third quarter. 
We expect full year restructuring-related charges of $17 million, $12 million of which is noncash. 
As a reminder, from last quarter's conference call, the quarterly slide decks we post to the Investor Relations website no longer contain unit growth rates of innerspring and boxspring pieces within our Residential Products segment. 
Because of content gains, including strong growth of our Comfort Core innersprings and other higher dollar value units, dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."
30760,610755115,1718535,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $13 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. A decrease in",746,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting normal seasonality, cash from operations was $31 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $13 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. A decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and inventory purchases, along with wind-down activity at restructured locations, led to the increase in working capital investment. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 13.4%. That percentage should come back down as 2019 progresses. 
We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. In February, we declared a $0.38 per share quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 48 years. 
We fully expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ECS acquisition. 
At Friday's closing price of $42.01, our current yield is 3.6%, which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
In keeping with our deleveraging plans, we repurchased only 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $42.38. These were primarily shares surrendered by employees for option exercises. We issued 1 million shares during the quarter, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
After completing the ECS acquisition in January, we ended the quarter with debt at 3.6x, our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA. We are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and expect to deleverage to a target ratio of debt-to-trailing 12-month's EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2020. 
We will do this by temporarily limiting share repurchases, reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. 
In addition, we expect to bring back roughly $170 million of offshore cash in 2019. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
We strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this top third goal over time. 
Our guidance for 2019 is unchanged. Full year sales are expected to be $4.95 billion to $5.1 billion, or up 16% to 19% over last year. ECS should add approximately $650 million to sales, commencing from the January 16 acquisition date, and we continue to expect annualized sales of approximately $675 million. 
In addition, organic sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3%, reflecting sales growth in automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace, Hydraulic Cylinders and Work Furniture, largely offset by our exit from Fashion Bed and planned declines in Home Furniture. 
Full year earnings per share are expected to be $2.35 to $2.55, including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring-related costs. Therefore, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.45 to $2.65, reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation, partially offset by higher tax rate. 
The ECS acquisition is expected to be neutral to EPS this year. EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24% versus 20% in 2018. This higher rate reflects the non-recurrence of valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018, a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019, the impact of TCJA executive compensation limits and cash implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ECS transaction. 
We expect full year depreciation and amortization of $210 million, net interest expense of approximately $95 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 10.8% to 11.2%. 
As previously mentioned, full year cash from operations should approximate $550 million, capital expenditures should be approximately $195 million for the year, and dividends should require $205 million of cash. Our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. 
Our long-term priorities for use of cash remain: one, organic growth involving capital expenditures and working capital investments; two, dividends; three, strategic acquisitions; and four, share repurchases. 
As previously stated, we are prioritizing debt repayment after organic growth of dividends and as a result are temporarily limiting share repurchases and reducing acquisition spending. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

The surprise is that we knew at the time of the acquisition that we were starting to see some chemical deflation so it's pressured selling prices a little bit but certainly not profitability and margins are enhanced as a percentage. So not a big surprise because TDI had increased significantly and now is coming back. So we're seeing deflation but it's -- for -- like I said, from profitability standpoint, it's not at all negative. The surprise probably has been the point that you started to make and that's the significant surge of dumped products in advance of the ruling that we expect will take place by statutory rules, the end of May, so there is a 90-day look back from a retro duty perspective. So we knew the product that had come into the country before the end of February was in effect duty-free but the significant surge of imports, 17% -- 71% in December, 63% in January, 56% in February, has surprised us, so it's dampened not only ECS' volume, certainly the whole U.S. industries volume. So it's impacted the conventional players in the U.S. as well. We expect that we'll start to get some relief. We -- the challenge is there's a lot of inventory in this country, it's being peeled off but it will take a while to all sort through. So we're certainly optimistic about the duties and the duty rates. We are really pleased that we've made the ECS acquisition. There is a lot of conversation, Perry's been involved with Chris Chrisafides, who runs ECS and the rest of the ECS team and our historic Bedding group, about new programs of onshoring and reshoring. Part of U.S. Spring's growth has been the growth of hybrids and boxed and in conventional platforms. So things are going really, really well. But those were kind of the 2 surprises."

Relatively good sales promotion and activity around Presidents' Day. But again, the impact of the imports, it's hard to gauge because we perceive that there's so much of that in the system. But I can tell you as the quarter went along, the cadence got quicker and more robust. We actually saw in one of the other business units that's been affected as you've mentioned in carpet or in our Flooring Products group, we did see some headwinds at the start of the year. Some of that obviously construction-related and weather-impacted but as we've gone along now and we've entered into the second quarter, we've seen our business volumes there recover, and we're bullish on that business as we go forward.  Now we're beginning to see some raw material relief there also."

As you probably recall that the vehicle production forecast has declined consistently since the middle of last year. In fact, vehicles are down almost about 2.8 million vehicles since the December forecast with over 2 million of those units coming out of the first half of the year. So we're looking at a forecast for the market that shows continued softness in the first half of the year with production down year-over-year, about 5%, and then the forecast improves in the back half of the year with production increasing year-over-year 3% to 4%, and that's pretty much -- that's reflective of the trends that we see as well. Remember that so we're facing pretty tough comps with the first half of last year being pretty strong and then falling off in the back half. So we'll expect to see a reverse of that this year. In PHC, in the Hydraulic Cylinders market, yes, last year was very strong. I think year to growth in material handling was up nearly 15%. Q1 was actually a little bit softer, down about 3%. We don't have good industry forecast there so -- unit pressure remained strong but we'll keep an eye out for that. Aerospace bills remain strong so we're in good shape there as well."

Certainly retaliatory tariffs in China have reduced demand for inputs there. The continued steel and aluminum tariffs are raising transaction prices in the U.S. slowing sales and those are really coming through lower incentives that the consumer's having to absorb. And then we also had the WLTP emissions testing backlog last year, and I think it's starting to work itself out but people expect we'll be in better position in the second half of the year. And then I think finally, there's some expectation that there'll be tax incentives in China that will help boost demand in the second half of 2019. So I think that part of the year-over-year negative reflection in the first half is that it was really strong in '18, and we see it softer in '19 and yes, the reverse scenario, so I don't think that production rates that are forecast in the back half are unrealistic."

That's helpful. And then I actually wanted to pivot the next question back to Karl around ECS, and I certainly agree with the acceleration of Chinese imports but my impression was that the imports are trying to get ahead of potential duties so that they would have inventory in place to last potentially through Q2. Not as a demand accelerant and we haven't seen much pricing change on import pricing at least that we see online. So I guess the core of my question is, why would the acceleration of imports be impacting overall demand trends as it relates to ECS?"

So it's the growth that really started in 2016, and the acceleration of that growth continues to pressure the entry price points in the U.S, which the first quarter is heavily sensitive to that seasonality. So there's a continuation of a loss of business to imports. So Peter, I fundamentally agree with your point that it's just -- it's an acceleration, the inventory is a bigger issue from a go-forward perspective that we expect will be melted off probably sometime by the end -- middle, the end of the third quarter as it will be interesting to see what the import statistics for March look like but short answer is, it's a continued pressure on the entry price points in the U.S. And from our perspective, and from an ECS perspective, there had been a lot of conversation and continues to be a lot of conversation of the domestic players moving to U.S. sourcing, some of them are reshoring, a good part of them are onshoring for the first time and as that inventory continues to grow, the start of those ECS programs gets pushed out. So there is a backward forecast at ECS that we think is appropriate and there'll also be an impact, a kind of knock-on benefit to our conventional U.S. Spring business and as I said in the prepared comments, to the U.S. Bedding industry as a whole."

I'm going to give you and everyone listening kind of a quick view of each business unit. So we'll go business unit by business unit, organized by segment. U.S. Spring, you saw 7% growth, we expect that to continue. Certainly the Bedding industry was impacted in January and February, to Perry's comments by weather. But there is an acceleration of our content gains, market share pickup, hybrids are a contributor to that. We expect dumping benefit in the -- certainly in the back half in U.S. Spring, so everything's really going well in U.S. Spring. I made the comments on ECS. We expect their back half business to significantly improve. International Spring performed well in the first quarter, we expect that to continue, there's a story by geography. Perry made a comment on flooring significantly negatively impacted in January, February. I think that's highly correlated to weather. Saw a gain in March, we expect kind of flat for the whole year there. Fabric converting highly correlated to Bedding and furniture, for the full year, we expect flat. Geo because of acquisitions, we expect 20% growth in that business and machinery is relatively small, it will be flat to slightly down because of the softness in the U.S. Bedding industry. Industrial, you saw a negative in the first quarter that was caused by our closure of a Formed Wire business that anniversary is actually next week, so it costs in the first quarter about $10 million of volume. So that negative will not repeat in the remainder of the year. Echoing some of Mitch's comments, Work Furniture, we expect mid-single digit growth for the year. Home Furniture should be flat with units down, dollars up because of the benefit of pricing actions that we're taking in the back half of last year. Mitch spoke to the impact of that FBG closure and Adjustable Beds, Auto for the year should be up mid- to high single digits. Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders both up in about 10% range.

Well, in the first quarter this year, Comfort Core was actually at 50% of the units sold, is up about 24%, if you look year-on-year. And then the other layer on content gains is not only the shift from Open Coil to Comfort Core but the Quantum Edge part of the story, and that was 43% of all the Comfort Core that we shipped in Q1 had a Quantum Edge element to it. So what do we attribute that to? I think it's a variety of things, but there is clearly a preference in the mid buying to premium categories of Comfort Core. And also in the box bed category. We're seeing continued penetration and expect that to go even further in the future. Quantum Edge is so prevalent and becoming so prevalent in box beds because the product itself is so good. It just makes sense. Our customers see the benefits of that product and that it opens up and it has from the start, from the opening process, an enhanced edge prior to that most of the foam products and a lot of the innerspring products had no support on the edge. This product does, it's got integrity and it stays through the life of the mattress. So we're excited about that. And again, all those products as they get sold through, that's additional volume for us and it's an additional opportunities for margin and it makes a great product."

If you think there are 7 million, 8 million mattresses, the run rate that was coming from China, some of that goes elsewhere around the world obviously. We think a lot of it gets repatriated to the U.S. and we're seeing our quote process in both amongst traditional customers and the box bed part of the business would indicate that there's a lot of that going to reshore and it's a tremendous opportunity for us and for the industry. And that's the reason for the filing. If you look at the schedule, as we know it today, around the end of May, commerce will make a preliminary determination of duties if those are favorable, there's also amongst the petitioners been filing to have some proactive element applied to those duties and that would be a 90-day look back if it's approved. We don't know for sure that it will be but it has -- we believe will put a cooling effect on all of that importation. We think it already has and if you look at a 90-day look back from the end of May, that's the end of February. So it will be interesting to see what the March numbers look like when we finally see those. But we expect the level of importation to certainly decelerate and to the degree of how quickly that happens, I don't know. But I think that the word is out. I think from all indications, we would look for a positive finding at the end of May and that begins to flow through, will there be a glut of product still sitting out there all through the second quarter, don't know, could be.

And at both the ECS level and the historic Leggett level, and again, hard to quantify. But there's an expectation that whatever percentage of those 8 million-ish units come back, a higher percentage of them will be Hybrid than are currently foam today. So we're excited mostly because of conversation with customers. You would know that Casper launched on their website a Hybrid effective 2 weeks ago. So that's new. They and other customers are talking about Hybrids where it historically had been foam.  So the combination of our Comfort Core and the exclusive materials from ECS are really, really powerful."

Perry is a leader within Leggett and a global bedding industry with contributions to numerous to detail today. Perry is a good friend. He will be missed both personally and professionally. 
Yesterday we reported second quarter sales increased 10% to $1.21 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. 
Sales also increased from continuing market share and content gains in U.S. [indiscernible], where sales were up 4%. This was more than offset by lower volume from business exited in our Furniture Products segment, weak trade demand in the Industrial Products segment and softer demand in Automotive. 
Organic sales declined 6% with volume down 6%. The exited business accounted for 3% of the decline. Negative currency impact offset raw material related selling increases implemented in 2018. 
Second quarter EBIT increased $15 million or 12% over the second quarter last year to $136 million, primarily from lower raw material cost including the LIFO benefit and the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense. 
These increases were partially offset by the impact from lower volume in several businesses and other smaller items. 
Second quarter EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 11.2%. Second quarter EBITDA increased $31 million over the second quarter of 2018 to $186 million and EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.3%. 
Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up $0.01 from the second quarter last year, impacted by the items mentioned as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
We reduced our full year sales guidance due to lower than previously expected sales at ECS and low organic sales. 
The ECS reduction is a combination of lower volume, primarily from programs that were delayed or did not develop, weakness in some of our non-Bedding markets and raw material related selling price decreases. We also have shifted some production to our U.S. Spring operations. 
The reduction in full year organic sales guidance is primarily from a lower than previously expected production in the Automotive market and lower trade demand for Steel, Rod and wire. 
In addition, we expect currency and steel related selling price decreases to be a headwind in the back half of the year. 
Even with these changes, we continue to expect full year sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, aerospace, hydraulic cylinders and Work Furniture. 
Matt will discuss full year guidance details as well as our near record operating cash in the quarter later in the call. But I wanted to update you on several operational items first. 
We received positive news in the quarter related to the Mattress industry's antidumping matter on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that mattresses were being sold at prices that violate the United States trade laws and impose preliminary dumping duties that range from 69% to 1,732%. This should allow domestic mistake mattress produces to compete on a more level playing field. 
We anticipate a final determination in the antidumping matter by the end of the year. 
We continue to be excited about the combined strength of ECS in our traditional Bedding business and the opportunity it presents for us going forward. 
In our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses, the restructuring activities are going very well. The most significant elements of both plans are behind us, and we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter. 
We already are seeing a positive impact from the restructuring with EBIT and EBIT margin up in the second quarter from lower fixed cost attributable to the restructuring as well as improved pricing and lower raw material cost. 
We continue to expect full year restructuring related charges of $17 million with $11 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the Automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the major global markets, which are North America, Europe, China, Japan and South Korea is down 6% and is now expected to be down 3% for the full year. 
Based on the latest forecast, vehicle production in the second half of the year is expected to be flat with both 2018 and the first half of 2019. 
While global production will be significantly lower than originally forecasted and will tamper our sales growth, we expect our Automotive business to continue to significantly outperform the market. I will now turn the call over to Matt."

Operating cash flow was $172 million in the second quarter, an increase of $92 million versus the second quarter last year and within $2 million of our all-time record for a 2Q operating cash flow performance. 
A keen focus upon working capital levels was reflected by our quarter and adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 12.4%, which improved from both last year's second quarter and sequentially, from this year's first quarter. 
We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. We are decreasing our full year capital expenditure expectations to $180 million from our prior estimate of $195 million. 
Dividend should require $205 million of cash. We ended the quarter with debt at 3.45x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, which is right in line with our deleveraging plans. 
We have so far brought back $60 million of offshore cash in 2019 and expect to return an additional $110 million before year end. 
As we announced yesterday, we are lowering our sales and EPS guidance for 2019. Full year sales are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion, or up 10% to 14% over last year. 
Acquisitions should add 15%. 
We expect organic sales to be down 1% to 5% including a 3% reduction from exited business. 
Our full year earnings per share guidance range has been reduced by [ $0.05 ] and is now $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
Including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related costs, and therefore adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.40 to $2.60. 
This decrease is due to the lower than expected sales, partially offset by decreasing steel cost. Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 11.1% to 11.4%. 
This EPS guidance also assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest of approximately $90 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

We do know that Chinese imports in May, which is the last published data, we're down by 55% in units. There has been some upshift in places like Vietnam that admittedly don't have near the manufacturing capacity that China had. 
To actually frame it that the Chinese units last year averaged 475,000 mattresses a month and much has been written about the Vietnam surge, which was 109,000 pieces in May as they start to build some capacity. 
What we do know, the facts are that our U.S. inner spring sales were positive in June and are positive in the first 3 weeks of July. We think some of that is coming from antidumping. We know ECS mattress unit sales are up in the 13% to 14% range year-to-date. We think some of that is the benefit of antidumping. We have an expectation that their growth will be greater than that in the back half as the inventory of Chinese mattresses has worked out. But -- so it's really kind of anecdotal. Things are moving in the right direction, but to try to quantify it going forward is a bit of a challenge."

Remember in the first quarter, we were the net of the 2 factors were up 2%, and we went flat in the second quarter and probably be negative in the third and fourth quarters but not by a lot but slightly Driven by the fact that last year we were still implementing selling price increases.

So now as Karl mentioned, a place where the production forecast, the market forecast for the second half of the year is now basically flat with the first half of '19 as well as the second half of '18. 
So when you look at the comps, it's quite impactful, right? The second half of '18 was down about 9% from the first half. So we are now facing less difficult comps. But [indiscernible] for our business, we still are very pleased with it, it continues to perform very well and our long-term outlook hasn't changed. I think with the disruption in the market that we see this year, we're not likely to get to our [ full 1,000  ] basis points over the market target, but I think we'll be able to get to something closer to 600 to 700. So we do see the back half as being a stronger for us on 2 factors. One as we said, the comps are simply easier. And tow, we see the back half up a bit for us not huge. I don't think anything overly optimistic at this point but more based on the traditional program, new program launches that take place in the back half of the year. 
I would also say that the profitability of this business even in this difficult environment continues to be incredibly strong and the team has done a really good job of reallocating or taking cost out of the business as we've seen some of the growth slow in this market. And I anticipate that will offset a very, very good chunk of the impact from the volume decline that we've seen from an EBIT standpoint, so and then you have a very positive outlook.

We -- there's a lag both directions with the raw materials typically with prices going up or costs going up our pricing typically lacks and most often caught up in the squeezer and coming up down, it can work in the opposite direction. You would have seen a big uptick in our LIFO benefit this quarter versus where we would have been earlier, obviously, in the first quarter of the first time we took a swing actually recognizing our full year estimate. So that helped our earnings, and it's built into the full year forecast now too. Now LIFO is not a unique assignment that is standing out there on its own. It is going to have offsetting dynamics happening within the operations that -- so deflation has been a net positive for us so far this year. And for the volume, obviously, it's not."

First, I want to thank Perry Davis for his nearly 4 decades of dedicated service to Leggett & Platt and congratulate him on his announced retirement early next year. Perry is a leader within Leggett and the global bedding industry with contributions too numerous to detail today. Perry is a good friend. He will be missed both personally and professionally. 
Yesterday we reported second quarter sales increased 10% to $1.21 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. 
Sales also increased from continuing market share and content gains in U.S. Spring, where sales were up 4%. This was more than offset by lower volume from business exited in our Furniture Products segment, weak trade demand in the Industrial Products segment and softer demand in Automotive. 
Organic sales declined 6% with volume down 6%. The exited business accounted for 3% of the decline. Negative currency impact offset raw material related selling increases implemented in 2018. 
Second quarter EBIT increased $15 million or 12% over the second quarter last year to $136 million, primarily from lower raw material cost including the LIFO benefit and the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense. 
These increases were partially offset by the impact from lower volume in several businesses and other smaller items. 
Second quarter EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 11.2%. Second quarter EBITDA increased $31 million over the second quarter of 2018 to $186 million and EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.3%. 
Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up $0.01 from the second quarter last year, impacted by the items mentioned as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
We reduced our full year sales guidance due to lower than previously expected sales at ECS and low organic sales. 
The ECS reduction is a combination of lower volume, primarily from programs that were delayed or did not develop, weakness in some of our non-Bedding markets and raw material related selling price decreases. We also have shifted some production to our U.S. Spring operations. 
The reduction in full year organic sales guidance is primarily from lower than previously expected production in the Automotive market and lower trade demand for steel, rod and wire. 
In addition, we expect currency and steel-related selling price decreases to be a headwind in the back half of the year. 
Even with these changes, we continue to expect full year sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace, Hydraulic Cylinders and Work Furniture. 
Matt will discuss full year guidance details as well as our near record operating cash in the quarter later in the call. But I wanted to update you on several operational items first. 
We received positive news in the quarter related to the Mattress industry's antidumping matter on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that mattresses were being sold at prices that violate the United States trade laws and impose preliminary dumping duties that range from 69% to 1,732%. This should allow domestic mistake mattress producers to compete on a more level playing field. 
We anticipate a final determination in the antidumping matter by the end of the year. 
We continue to be excited about the combined strength of ECS in our traditional Bedding business and the opportunities it presents for us going forward. 
In our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses, the restructuring activities are going very well. The most significant elements of both plans are behind us, and we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter. 
We already are seeing a positive impact from the restructuring with EBIT and EBIT margin up in the second quarter from lower fixed cost attributable to the restructuring as well as improved pricing and lower raw material cost. 
We continue to expect full year restructuring related charges of $17 million with $11 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the Automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the major global markets, which are North America, Europe, China, Japan and South Korea is down 6% and is now expected to be down 3% for the full year. 
Based on the latest forecast, vehicle production in the second half of the year is expected to be flat with both 2018 and the first half of 2019. 
While global production will be significantly lower than originally forecasted and will tamper our sales growth, we expect our Automotive business to continue to significantly outperform the market. I will now turn the call over to Matt."

Operating cash flow was $172 million in the second quarter, an increase of $92 million versus the second quarter last year and within $2 million of our all-time record for a 2Q operating cash flow performance. 
A keen focus upon working capital levels was reflected by our quarter and adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 12.4%, which improved from both last year's second quarter and sequentially, from this year's first quarter. 
We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. We are decreasing our full year capital expenditure expectations to $180 million from our prior estimate of $195 million. 
Dividend should require $205 million of cash. We ended the quarter with debt at 3.45x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, which is right in line with our deleveraging plans. 
We have so far brought back $60 million of offshore cash in 2019 and expect to return an additional $110 million before year end. 
As we announced yesterday, we are lowering our sales and EPS guidance for 2019. Full year sales are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion, or up 10% to 14% over last year. 
Acquisitions should add 15%. 
We expect organic sales to be down 1% to 5% including a 3% reduction from exited business. 
Our full year earnings per share guidance range has been reduced by $0.05 and is now $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
Including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related costs, and therefore adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.40 to $2.60. 
This decrease is due to the lower than expected sales, partially offset by decreasing steel cost. Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 11.1% to 11.4%. 
This EPS guidance also assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest of approximately $90 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

We do know that Chinese imports in May, which is the last published data, were down by 55% in units. There has been some upshift in places like Vietnam that admittedly don't have near the manufacturing capacity that China had. 
To actually frame it that the Chinese units last year averaged 475,000 mattresses a month and much has been written about the Vietnam surge, which was 109,000 pieces in May as they start to build some capacity. 
What we do know, the facts are that our U.S. inner spring sales were positive in June and are positive in the first 3 weeks of July. We think some of that is coming from antidumping. We know ECS mattress unit sales are up in the 13% to 14% range year-to-date. We think some of that is the benefit of antidumping. We have an expectation that their growth will be greater than that in the back half as the inventory of Chinese mattresses has worked out. But -- so it's really kind of anecdotal. Things are moving in the right direction, but to try to quantify it going forward is a bit of a challenge."

We would expect that currency and the inflation/deflation effect from raw materials will probably be largely offset for the full year if not slightly negative but not -- the 2 combined not hugely negative. 
Remember in the first quarter, we were -- the net of the 2 factors were up 2%, and we went flat in the second quarter and probably be negative in the third and fourth quarters but not by a lot but slightly driven by the fact that last year we were still implementing selling price increases. This year, that's beginning to turn to decreases, and as we anniversary last year's increases, then that's going to allow those 2 to net to something lower than they have been so far this year.

And that's another element, the production forecast has continued to decline month-over-month and took another big step downward in July which certainly impacts our outlook. I think now it feels like we're at a less optimistic and more realistic place with the forecast. I'm not talking about the IHS production forecast on our own. So now as Karl mentioned, a place where the production forecast, the market forecast for the second half of the year is now basically flat with the first half of '19 as well as the second half of '18. 
So when you look at the comps, it's quite impactful, right? The second half of '18 was down about 9% from the first half. So we are now facing less difficult comps. But -- take for our business, we still are very pleased with it, it continues to perform very well and our long-term outlook hasn't changed. I think with the disruption in the market that we see this year, we're not likely to get to our full 1,000 basis points over the market target, but I think we'll be able to get to something closer to 600 to 700. So we do see the back half as being stronger for us on 2 factors. One as we said, here the comps are simply easier. And two, we see the back half up a bit for us not huge. I don't think anything overly optimistic at this point but more based on the traditional program -- new program launches that take place in the back half of the year. 
I would also say that the profitability of this business even in this difficult environment continues to be incredibly strong and the team has done a really good job of reallocating or taking cost out of the business as we've seen some of the growth slow in this market. And I anticipate that will offset a very, very good chunk of the impact from the volume decline that we've seen from an EBIT standpoint. So -- and then you have a very positive outlook.

So that's one of the wonderful things about Leggett is, we manage from a very long-term perspective but yes, there's an opportunity to take additional cost out. The other thing that happens in a downshift is historically there has been significant improvement in cash generation. So in cash, it doesn't become compromised, actually, it helps.

First, I want to thank Perry Davis for his nearly 4 decades of dedicated service to Leggett & Platt and congratulate him on his announced retirement early next year. Perry is a leader within Leggett and the global bedding industry with contributions too numerous to detail today. Perry is a good friend. He will be missed both personally and professionally. 
Yesterday we reported second quarter sales increased 10% to $1.21 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. 
Sales also increased from continuing market share and content gains in U.S. Spring, where sales were up 4%. This was more than offset by lower volume from business exited in our Furniture Products segment, weak trade demand in the Industrial Products segment and softer demand in Automotive. 
Organic sales declined 6% with volume down 6%. The exited business accounted for 3% of the decline. Negative currency impact offset raw material related selling price increases implemented in 2018. 
Second quarter EBIT increased $15 million or 12% over the second quarter last year to $136 million, primarily from lower raw material cost including the LIFO benefit and the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense. 
These increases were partially offset by the impact from lower volume in several businesses and other smaller items. 
Second quarter EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 11.2%. Second quarter EBITDA increased $31 million over the second quarter of 2018 to $186 million and EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.3%. 
Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up $0.01 from the second quarter last year, impacted by the items mentioned as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
We reduced our full year sales guidance due to lower than previously expected sales at ECS and low organic sales. 
The ECS reduction is a combination of lower volume, primarily from programs that were delayed or did not develop, weakness in some of our non-Bedding markets and raw material related selling price decreases. We also have shifted some production to our U.S. Spring operations. 
The reduction in full year organic sales guidance is primarily from lower than previously expected production in the Automotive market and lower trade demand for steel, rod and wire. 
In addition, we expect currency and steel-related selling price decreases to be a headwind in the back half of the year. 
Even with these changes, we continue to expect full year sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace, Hydraulic Cylinders and Work Furniture. 
Matt will discuss full year guidance details as well as our near record operating cash in the quarter later in the call. But I wanted to update you on several operational items first. 
We received positive news in the quarter related to the Mattress industry's antidumping matter on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that mattresses were being sold at prices that violate the United States trade laws and impose preliminary dumping duties that range from 69% to 1,732%. This should allow domestic mistake mattress producers to compete on a more level playing field. 
We anticipate a final determination in the antidumping matter by the end of the year. 
We continue to be excited about the combined strength of ECS in our traditional Bedding business and the opportunities it presents for us going forward. 
In our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses, the restructuring activities are going very well. The most significant elements of both plans are behind us, and we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter. 
We already are seeing a positive impact from the restructuring with EBIT and EBIT margin up in the second quarter from lower fixed cost attributable to the restructuring as well as improved pricing and lower raw material cost. 
We continue to expect full year restructuring related charges of $17 million with $11 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the Automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the major global markets, which are North America, Europe, China, Japan and South Korea is down 6% and is now expected to be down 3% for the full year. 
Based on the latest forecast, vehicle production in the second half of the year is expected to be flat with both 2018 and the first half of 2019. 
While global production will be significantly lower than originally forecasted and will temper our sales growth, we expect our Automotive business to continue to significantly outperform the market. I will now turn the call over to Matt."

Operating cash flow was $172 million in the second quarter, an increase of $92 million versus the second quarter last year and within $2 million of our all-time record for a 2Q operating cash flow performance. 
A keen focus upon working capital levels was reflected by our quarter and adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 12.4%, which improved from both last year's second quarter and sequentially, from this year's first quarter. 
We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. We are decreasing our full year capital expenditure expectations to $180 million from our prior estimate of $195 million. 
Dividends should require $205 million of cash. We ended the quarter with debt at 3.45x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, which is right in line with our deleveraging plans. 
We have so far brought back $60 million of offshore cash in 2019 and expect to return an additional $110 million before year end. 
As we announced yesterday, we are lowering our sales and EPS guidance for 2019. Full year sales are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion, or up 10% to 14% over last year. 
Acquisitions should add 15%. 
We expect organic sales to be down 1% to 5% including a 3% reduction from exited business. 
Our full year earnings per share guidance range has been reduced by $0.05 and is now $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
Including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring related costs, and therefore adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.40 to $2.60. 
This decrease is due to the lower than expected sales, partially offset by decreasing steel cost. Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 11.1% to 11.4%. 
This EPS guidance also assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest of approximately $90 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

We do know that Chinese imports in May, which is the last published data, were down by 55% in units. There has been some upshift in places like Vietnam that admittedly don't have near the manufacturing capacity that China had. 
To actually frame it that the Chinese units last year averaged 475,000 mattresses a month and much has been written about the Vietnam surge, which was 109,000 pieces in May as they start to build some capacity. 
What we do know, the facts are that our U.S. inner spring sales were positive in June and are positive in the first 3 weeks of July. We think some of that is coming from antidumping. We know ECS mattress unit sales are up in the 13% to 14% range year-to-date. We think some of that is the benefit of antidumping. We have an expectation that their growth will be greater than that in the back half as the inventory of Chinese mattresses has worked out. But -- so it's really kind of anecdotal. Things are moving in the right direction, but to try to quantify it going forward is a bit of a challenge."

Remember in the first quarter, we were -- the net of the 2 factors were up 2%, and we went flat in the second quarter and probably be negative in the third and fourth quarters but not by a lot but slightly driven by the fact that last year we were still implementing selling price increases. This year, that's beginning to turn to decreases, and as we anniversary last year's increases, then that's going to allow those 2 to net to something lower than they have been so far this year.

And that's another element, the production forecast has continued to decline month-over-month and took another big step downward in July which certainly impacts our outlook. I think now it feels like we're at a less optimistic and more realistic place with the forecast. I'm talking about the IHS production forecast not our own. So now as Karl mentioned, we're at a place where the production forecast, the market forecast for the second half of the year is now basically flat with the first half of '19 as well as the second half of '18. 
So when you look at the comps, it's quite impactful, right? The second half of '18 was down about 9% from the first half. So we are now facing less difficult comps. But -- take for our business, we still are very pleased with it, it continues to perform very well and our long-term outlook hasn't changed. I think with the disruption in the market that we see this year, we're not likely to get to our full 1,000 basis points over the market target, but I think we'll be able to get to something closer to 600 to 700. So we do see the back half as being stronger for us on 2 factors. One as we said, here the comps are simply easier. And two, we see the back half up a bit for us not huge. I don't think anything overly optimistic at this point but more based on the traditional program -- new program launches that take place in the back half of the year. 
I would also say that the profitability of this business even in this difficult environment continues to be incredibly strong and the team has done a really good job of reallocating or taking cost out of the business as we've seen some of the growth slow in this market. And I anticipate that will offset a very, very good chunk of the impact from the volume decline that we've seen from an EBIT standpoint. So -- and then you have a very positive outlook.

I think -- we think that based on a calendar basis, remember that industry numbers, the industry numbers are lagged. But on a calendar basis, I think the first quarter was down about 12% year-over-year and we think the industry was down about 1% in Q2. I know that's a lot less than the industry numbers. And I think there's a couple of things that are going on to impact that. We think that if we look back at the industry numbers for the second quarter of 2018, I think they were at something like 1 million units, which seems really, really high for that period of time. So I think that's probably throwing off the year-over-year comparison to a large degree. And I don't mean to be critical, I say, this isn't an easy task. Tracking the import data is difficult, there's multiple HTS codes, they get shifted around. So I -- we don't believe, we certainly haven't seen negative impact anything like the industry is reporting. So we just -- we think there's a data problem there."

First, I want to thank Perry Davis for his nearly 4 decades of dedicated service to Leggett & Platt and congratulate him on his announced retirement early next year. Perry is a leader within Leggett and the global bedding industry with contributions too numerous to detail today. Perry is a good friend. He will be missed both personally and professionally. 
Yesterday we reported second quarter sales increased 10% to $1.21 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. 
Sales also increased from continuing market share and content gains in U.S. Spring, where sales were up 4%. This was more than offset by lower volume from business exited in our Furniture Products segment, weak trade demand in the Industrial Products segment and softer demand in Automotive. 
Organic sales declined 6% with volume down 6%. The exited business accounted for 3% of the decline. Negative currency impact offset raw material-related selling price increases implemented in 2018. 
Second quarter EBIT increased $15 million or 12% over the second quarter last year to $136 million, primarily from lower raw material cost including the LIFO benefit and the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense. 
These increases were partially offset by the impact from lower volume in several businesses and other smaller items. 
Second quarter EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 11.2%. Second quarter EBITDA increased $31 million over the second quarter of 2018 to $186 million and EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.3%. 
Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up $0.01 from the second quarter last year, impacted by the items mentioned as well as higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. 
We reduced our full year sales guidance due to lower than previously expected sales at ECS and low organic sales. 
The ECS reduction is a combination of lower volume, primarily from programs that were delayed or did not develop, weakness in some of our non-Bedding markets and raw material-related selling price decreases. We also have shifted some production to our U.S. Spring operations. 
The reduction in full year organic sales guidance is primarily from lower than previously expected production in the Automotive market and lower trade demand for steel, rod and wire. 
In addition, we expect currency and steel-related selling price decreases to be a headwind in the back half of the year. 
Even with these changes, we continue to expect full year sales growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Aerospace, Hydraulic Cylinders and Work Furniture. 
Matt will discuss full year guidance details as well as our near record operating cash in the quarter later in the call. But I wanted to update you on several operational items first. 
We received positive news in the quarter related to the Mattress industry's antidumping matter on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that mattresses were being sold at prices that violate the United States trade laws and impose preliminary dumping duties that range from 69% to 1,732%. This should allow domestic mistake mattress producers to compete on a more level playing field. 
We anticipate a final determination in the antidumping matter by the end of the year. 
We continue to be excited about the combined strength of ECS in our traditional Bedding business and the opportunities it presents for us going forward. 
In our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses, the restructuring activities are going very well. The most significant elements of both plans are behind us, and we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter. 
We already are seeing a positive impact from the restructuring with EBIT and EBIT margin up in the second quarter from lower fixed cost attributable to the restructuring as well as improved pricing and lower raw material cost. 
We continue to expect full year restructuring-related charges of $17 million with $11 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the Automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the major global markets, which are North America, Europe, China, Japan and South Korea is down 6% and is now expected to be down 3% for the full year. 
Based on the latest forecast, vehicle production in the second half of the year is expected to be flat with both 2018 and the first half of 2019. 
While global production will be significantly lower than originally forecasted and will temper our sales growth, we expect our Automotive business to continue to significantly outperform the market. I will now turn the call over to Matt."

Operating cash flow was $172 million in the second quarter, an increase of $92 million versus the second quarter last year and within $2 million of our all-time record for a 2Q operating cash flow performance. 
A keen focus upon working capital levels was reflected by our quarter and adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 12.4%, which improved from both last year's second quarter and sequentially, from this year's first quarter. 
We continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $550 million. We are decreasing our full year capital expenditure expectations to $180 million from our prior estimate of $195 million. 
Dividends should require $205 million of cash. We ended the quarter with debt at 3.45x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, which is right in line with our deleveraging plans. 
We have so far brought back $60 million of offshore cash in 2019 and expect to return an additional $110 million before year-end. 
As we announced yesterday, we are lowering our sales and EPS guidance for 2019. Full year sales are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion, or up 10% to 14% over last year. 
Acquisitions should add 15%. 
We expect organic sales to be down 1% to 5% including a 3% reduction from exited business. 
Our full year earnings per share guidance range has been reduced by $0.05 and is now $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
Including approximately $0.10 per share of restructuring-related costs, and therefore adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.40 to $2.60. 
This decrease is due to the lower than expected sales, partially offset by decreasing steel cost. Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin should be 11.1% to 11.4%. 
This EPS guidance also assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest of approximately $90 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

We do know that Chinese imports in May, which is the last published data, were down by 55% in units. There has been some upshift in places like Vietnam that admittedly don't have near the manufacturing capacity that China had. 
To actually frame it that the Chinese units last year averaged 475,000 mattresses a month and much has been written about the Vietnam surge, which was 109,000 pieces in May as they start to build some capacity. 
What we do know, the facts are that our U.S. inner spring sales were positive in June and are positive in the first 3 weeks of July. We think some of that is coming from antidumping. We know ECS mattress unit sales are up in the 13% to 14% range year-to-date. We think some of that is the benefit of antidumping. We have an expectation that their growth will be greater than that in the back half as the inventory of Chinese mattresses has worked out. But -- so it's really kind of anecdotal. Things are moving in the right direction, but to try to quantify it going forward is a bit of a challenge."

Remember in the first quarter, we were -- the net of the 2 factors were up 2%, and we went flat in the second quarter and probably be negative in the third and fourth quarters but not by a lot but slightly driven by the fact that last year we were still implementing selling price increases. This year, that's beginning to turn to decreases, and as we anniversary last year's increases, then that's going to allow those 2 to net to something lower than they have been so far this year.

I think now it feels like we're at a less optimistic and more realistic place with the forecast. I'm talking about the IHS production forecast not our own. So now as Karl mentioned, we're at a place where the production forecast, the market forecast for the second half of the year is now basically flat with the first half of '19 as well as the second half of '18. 
So when you look at the comps, it's quite impactful, right? The second half of '18 was down about 9% from the first half. So we are now facing less difficult comps. But -- take for our business, we still are very pleased with it, it continues to perform very well and our long-term outlook hasn't changed. I think with the disruption in the market that we see this year, we're not likely to get to our full 1,000 basis points over the market target, but I think we'll be able to get to something closer to 600 to 700. So we do see the back half as being stronger for us on 2 factors. One as we said, here the comps are simply easier. And two, we see the back half up a bit for us not huge. I don't think anything overly optimistic at this point but more based on the traditional program -- new program launches that take place in the back half of the year. 
I would also say that the profitability of this business even in this difficult environment continues to be incredibly strong and the team has done a really good job of reallocating or taking cost out of the business as we've seen some of the growth slow in this market. And I anticipate that will offset a very, very good chunk of the impact from the volume decline that we've seen from an EBIT standpoint. So -- and then you have a very positive outlook.

And I think there's a couple of things that are going on to impact that. We think that if we look back at the industry numbers for the second quarter of 2018, I think they were at something like 1 million units, which seems really, really high for that period of time. So I think that's probably throwing off the year-over-year comparison to a large degree. And I don't mean to be critical, I say, this isn't an easy task.

He is a member of the Board of Directors of TCF Financial Corporation, where he serves as chair of the finance committee and as a member of the audit risk management and compensation and pension committees. 
He also previously served on the public company accounting oversight board's standard advisory group. Jeff brings tremendous strategic and financial capabilities to Leggett. He is well aligned with our culture and is a strong addition to our senior management team. 
Welcome, Jeff. We are excited you are here. 
I also want to recognize Perry Davis. As I mentioned last quarter, Perry is retiring in early 2020 after nearly 40 years with Leggett & Platt and this will be his last earnings call as a participant. We will miss you, Perry, and I suspect that you won't miss participating in these conference calls going forward. 
We have several items to highlight in our third quarter results. Yesterday, we reported third quarter sales growth of 14%, third quarter EBIT growth of 16% and adjusted EBIT growth of 19%. 
Third quarter earnings per share were $0.74 and adjusted EPS was $0.76, a 15% increase over third quarter 2018 adjusted EPS. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was a strong [ $213 ] million. Adjusted working capital was a percent of annualized sales for the quarter improved to 10.7%. 
Our results show the focus our teams have on cash generation, your efforts are much appreciated. Third quarter sales were $1.24 billion, growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. 
Organic sales were down 2%, 1% from volume and 1% from deflation and a negative currency impact. 
Our Automotive, U.S. Spring and Work Furniture businesses had solid third quarter sales growth, offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 4% and weak trade demand for steel, rod and wire. 
Absent declines from exited business, volume was up 3%. Our Bedding businesses continued to perform well with U.S. Spring sales up 6% in the quarter. Finished mattress units were up 28% in the third quarter, including year-over-year growth at ECS. 
Automotive sales were up 8% in the quarter and Work Furniture was up 6%. Third quarter 2019 earnings per share were $0.74, this included $4 million of restructuring related charges that reduced earnings $0.02 per share. 
Third quarter 2018 EPS of $0.67 included a $0.01 per share benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.76 were up $0.10 from adjusted 2018 third quarter earnings, reflecting higher EBIT and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense, lower raw material cost including the LIFO benefit and improved earnings performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 50 basis points to 11.9% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.8%. The restructuring activities we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses are substantially complete. 
With the segments adjusted EBIT of $12 million and adjusted EBIT margin of a notable 470 basis points in the quarter, we are already seeing a positive impact from the lower fixed cost and improved pricing. We have further restructuring in the third quarter from the closure of a small machinery facility in our residential products segment and a wired drawing facility in our Industrial Products segment. 
We now expect full-year restructuring related charges of $14 million, $7 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the Automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the global markets is down 6% and is expected to be down approximately 6% for the full year. Our Automotive business grew 8% versus third quarter 2018, exceeding global market growth by over 1,000 basis points. 
This year, we should exceed market growth by 600 to 700 basis points. We remain confident in our continued strong performance. Ongoing disruption of the global markets makes it difficult to predict our relative performance with precision. 
Accordingly, we are moving away from our specific goal of exciting market growth by 1,000 basis points. Although, we still expect to significantly outperform the market over the long term. 
In mid-October, we received more positive news from the United States mattress industries antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a final determination that Chinese mattresses are being sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws and imposed final antidumping duties that ranged from 57% to 1,732%. 
Importantly, approximately [ 90%  ] of Chinese mattresses are now subject to antidumping duties in excess of 160%. We expect the United States International Trade Commission to make a final determination in the antidumping matter no later than the 1st week of December. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

As previously mentioned, operating cash flow was a strong $213 million in the third quarter, an increase of $86 million versus the same quarter last year. Another quarter of key focus on working capital levels was reflected by our quarter and adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.7%, an improvement versus 12.4% in the second quarter and 12% in the third quarter of 2018. 
We now expect our full year operating cash flow to exceed $550 million. Demonstrating our ongoing capital discipline, we are reducing our full year capital expenditure estimate from $180 million to $160 million, and dividend should require $205 million for the year. 
Through the third quarter of 2019, we have returned over $180 million of offshore cash and expect to bring back an additional $50 million before year end. This significantly exceeds our original full year expectation to bring back $170 million of offshore cash. 
We ended the quarter with debt at 3.15x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, an improvement over second quarter's 3.45x. 
As we announced yesterday, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance range for 2019 to $2.40 to $2.55 from a range of $2.30 to $2.50, including approximately $0.08 per share of restructuring related costs. 
Accordingly, full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $2.48 to $2.63. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin range should be 11% to 11.3%. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 22%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest expense of $85 million and fully diluted shares of $136 million. 
We are narrowing our full year sales guidance expectations to [ $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, ] or up 10% to 12% over last year. Acquisitions should add 15% year-over-year growth. We expect our organic sales to be down 3% to 5% including a 3% reduction from planned exited businesses in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. 
We also expect full year sales growth in U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture, Adjustable Bed and Aerospace. 
And finally, I'd like to close. We invite you to our Investor Day on Monday, November 18 in New York City. We will webcast the event, which will take place from 8:30 a.m. to noon Eastern Time.

I thought at 1 point we might top out at about 40%, that's not the case and more and more customers are seeing the value, both in their manufacturing efficiencies and in the true benefits that can be demonstrated to the consumer in those spring enhanced products. By the way, that's -- it's not inconsequential also they we're seeing more and more of that product in compressed rolled mattresses as a built-in Edge support.

Sales midpoint that slight reduction, uncertainty is really the key word. 
Deflation has become more apparent, scrap has traded off more aggressively since we issued last guidance than we expected. So we're starting to see some reduced selling prices first in the industrial segment that will ultimately move to residential, that's actually good for margins because of the late lag. So it's kind of a negative positive, if that makes any sense. And as we continue on, you hit it. The IHS data on Automotive continues to reduce at a kind of an accelerated rate. We think the majority of that was the -- was caused by the GM strike. So from our data point, we would have had the impact of the strike for just a couple of weeks in the third quarter, certainly all of October in the fourth quarter. And even though the autoworkers have ratified the election that we don't know to what degree that the supply chain will ramp up. So there's some uncertainty and with that slight downshift, we've allowed ourselves in a little bit of cushion for that uncertainty. As it relates to EPS, we're dealing with a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
You'll notice that our third quarter tax rate came in very favorably to forecast. I really need to call out our people. They did a wonderful job of bringing back this offshore cash at a lower rate than we originally expected. So that drove lower tax rate, lower interest expense, our people have done a great job of cash generation. So we have more cash, lower interest rates from a macro perspective, so that's driving part of it. We're also seeing improved margins, again, from the deflation and from the terrific job that our people have done on the restructuring of the Furniture Products segment. So weld that altogether, slight downdraft on top line. Again, it's just a testament to macro uncertainty and pick up an EPS for all the reasons I listed."

In answer to your question has deflation, it definitely has impacted topline there significantly. 
We kind of knew at the time of the acquisition and the months leading it up that we were looking at some pretty historically high chemical input cost and that those were likely to fall over time. 
But more importantly, we wanted to look at what ECS could generate in terms of margins through that downturn. And as that began to turn around and we became comfortable with their ability to recoup those costs, when and assuredly, they will go up at some point over time, it's a commodity. But we became really comfortable with the pricing power in the marketplace, with the uniqueness of the product offerings that they had and the position they had in the value chain. So there's a comment in our release with regards to 28% increase in their finished mattress products year-on-year. That's a total of -- if you took the historical 2018 ECS and the Leggett pieces that were produced in terms of finished mattresses and then you just look at this year, the total amount is up 28%. So that certainly met our expectations in terms of double-digit growth, it's just kind of hitting a little bit because of the massive deflation impacts that we've seen."

So we're seeing those declines in our business really as supply chain catches up to the long lead time that we had in 2017 and 2018, when volumes were up over 15%. 
We're going from an environment where we couldn't keep up to now one where we see pretty significant declines in demand. So that's really the phenomenon there. 
Interestingly, our earnings were roughly flat because last year we were struggling to pass through raw material cost inflation, so that's what relates to your pricing comments.

To your anniversary, I think our Home Furniture will probably see that we're don't have full year this year of some of the business that we exited, so we'll see a little bit impact from a sales standpoint next year, but I think we'll see continued margin improvement. 
And then from a Fashion Bed standpoint, we're pretty well wrapped down by the end of the third quarter from a sales standpoint. So I'm trying to remember here, so we basically have no sales repeating next year. We have a small hospitality business that we're looking to exit but that's about $15 million.

So as I said, Comfort Core in the U.S. for Leggett is approaching 60%. Bear in mind, in the U.S., we play in all the different areas of the value chains pretty strongly, whether it's promotional to premium. In Europe, not so much the case. We tend to trend more towards the upper end or the mid-upper end part of the markets where Comfort Core as a percentage of total innerspring in Europe represents a higher percentage of our sales. There are a lot of low-cost [indiscernible] and Open Coil innersprings in that market that are imported, and we don't tend to play so much in that market and historically have not. So Comfort Core would represent an even higher percentage of our sales in Europe."

We've added lines for additional mattress production. We changed some flow layouts and things in order to get better efficiencies within our manufacturing operations. But again, that handicapped when you look at it in terms of dollars by the overall pretty severe deflationary environment. Again, a little under half at last count of our mattress volume in that space was under contract. So we see much as we do and are still related businesses.

First, I want to welcome Jeff Tate, our new CFO to our team and to introduce him. As most of you are likely aware, Jeff joined Leggett & Platt in September from the Dow Chemical Company, where he most recently served as Vice President and business CFO for their largest operating segment: packaging and specialty plastics with combined revenue of over $24 billion. 
Jeff was a member of the portfolio executive team, where he drove financial discipline and provided financial counsel at the strategic and operational levels of the business. 
His responsibilities included portfolio analysis, value-based strategy development, business risk analysis, short- and long-term financial planning, performance measurement and analysis and in ensuring proper internal controls. 
In prior roles, Jeff led Dow's global internal audit activities and was Director of Investor Relations. 
Jeff is a certified public accountant with a BS in accounting from the University of Alabama. He is a member of the Board of Directors of TCF Financial Corporation, where he serves as chair of the finance committee and as a member of the audit risk management and compensation and pension committees. 
He also previously served on the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Standing Advisory Group. Jeff brings tremendous strategic and financial capabilities to Leggett. He is well aligned with our culture and is a strong addition to our senior management team. 
Welcome, Jeff. We are excited you are here. 
I also want to recognize Perry Davis. As I mentioned last quarter, Perry is retiring in early 2020 after nearly 40 years with Leggett & Platt. And this will be his last earnings call as a participant. We will miss you, Perry, and I suspect that you won't miss participating in these conference calls going forward. 
We have several items to highlight in our third quarter results. Yesterday, we reported third quarter sales growth of 14%, third quarter EBIT growth of 16% and adjusted EBIT growth of 19%. 
Third quarter earnings per share were $0.74 and adjusted EPS was $0.76, a 15% increase over third quarter 2018 adjusted EPS. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was a strong $213 million. Adjusted working capital was a percent of annualized sales for the quarter improved to 10.7%. 
Our results show the focus our teams have on cash generation. Your efforts are much appreciated. Third quarter sales were $1.24 billion, growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. 
Organic sales were down 2%, 1% from volume and 1% from deflation and a negative currency impact. 
Our Automotive, U.S. Spring and Work Furniture businesses had solid third quarter sales growth, offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 4% and weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. 
Absent declines from exited business, volume was up 3%. Our Bedding businesses continued to perform well with U.S. Spring sales up 6% in the quarter. Finished mattress units were up 28% in the third quarter, including year-over-year growth at ECS. 
Automotive sales were up 8% in the quarter and Work Furniture was up 6%. Third quarter 2019 earnings per share were $0.74, this included $4 million of restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.02 per share. 
Third quarter 2018 EPS of $0.67 included a $0.01 per share benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.76 were up $0.10 from adjusted 2018 third quarter earnings, reflecting higher EBIT and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense, lower raw material cost, including the LIFO benefit and improved earnings performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 50 basis points to 11.9% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.8%. The restructuring activities we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses are substantially complete. 
With the segments adjusted EBIT of $12 million and adjusted EBIT margin of a notable 470 basis points in the quarter, we are already seeing a positive impact from the lower fixed cost and improved pricing. We have further restructuring in the third quarter from the closure of a small machinery facility in our residential products segment and a wire drawing facility in our Industrial Products segment. 
We now expect full year restructuring-related charges of $14 million, $7 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the Automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the global markets is down 6% and is expected to be down approximately 6% for the full year. Our Automotive business grew 8% versus third quarter 2018, exceeding global market growth by over 1,000 basis points. This year, we should exceed market growth by 600 to 700 basis points. We remain confident in our continued strong performance. Ongoing disruption of the global markets makes it difficult to predict our relative performance with precision. 
Accordingly, we are moving away from our specific goal of exceeding market growth by 1,000 basis points. Although, we still expect to significantly outperform the market over the long term. 
In mid-October, we received more positive news from the United States mattress industries antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a final determination that Chinese mattresses are being sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws and imposed final antidumping duties that ranged from 57% to 1,732%. 
Importantly, approximately 90% of Chinese mattresses are now subject to antidumping duties in excess of 160%. We expect the United States International Trade Commission to make a final determination in the antidumping matter no later than the 1st week of December. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

We now expect our full year operating cash flow to exceed $550 million. Demonstrating our ongoing capital discipline, we are reducing our full year capital expenditure estimate from $180 million to $160 million, and dividend should require $205 million for the year. 
Through the third quarter of 2019, we have returned over $180 million of offshore cash and expect to bring back an additional $50 million before year end. This significantly exceeds our original full year expectation to bring back $170 million of offshore cash. 
We ended the quarter with debt at 3.15x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, an improvement over second quarter's 3.45x. 
As we announced yesterday, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance range for 2019 to $2.40 to $2.55 from a range of $2.30 to $2.50, including approximately $0.08 per share of restructuring related costs. 
Accordingly, full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $2.48 to $2.63. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin range should be 11% to 11.3%. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 22%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest expense of $85 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. 
We are narrowing our full year sales guidance expectations to $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, or up 10% to 12% over last year. Acquisitions should add 15% year-over-year growth. We expect our organic sales to be down 3% to 5%, including a 3% reduction from planned exited businesses in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. 
We also expect full year sales growth in U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture, Adjustable Bed and Aerospace. 
And finally, as I close, we invite you to our Investor Day on Monday, November 18 in New York City. We will webcast the event, which will take place from 8:30 a.m. to noon Eastern Time. The webcast and slides will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please contact Investor Relations for more information and to sign up.

And of that Comfort Core, our Quantum Edge products are those products that have basically replaced phone with springs. As a percent of Comfort Core Quantum Edge and Edge enhanced products are about 48% of the total Comfort Core. So it's almost half at this point, well beyond what I thought. I thought at one point, we might top out at about 40%, that's not the case and more and more customers are seeing the value, both in their manufacturing efficiencies and in the true benefits that can be demonstrated to the consumer in those spring-enhanced products. By the way, that's -- it's not inconsequential also that we're seeing more and more of that product in compressed rolled mattresses as a built-in Edge support.

We saw sales tick down slightly at the midpoint but EPS come up -- actually come up versus prior expectations.

Is it further incremental deflation, uncertainty around auto or uncertainty around the external sales for wire? And then maybe connect that on what's driving the EPS a little bit higher as well?"

Sales midpoint that slight reduction uncertainty is really the key word. 
Deflation has become more apparent, scrap has traded off more aggressively since we issued last guidance than we expected. So we're starting to see some reduced selling prices first in the industrial segment that will ultimately move to residential. That's actually good for margins because of the delayed lag. So it's kind of a negative positive, if that makes any sense. And as we continue on, you hit it. The IHS data on Automotive continues to reduce at a kind of an accelerated rate. We think the majority of that was the -- was caused by the GM strike. So from our data point, we would have had the impact of the strike for just a couple of weeks in the third quarter, certainly all of October in the fourth quarter. And even though the autoworkers have ratified the election that we don't know to what degree that the supply chain will ramp up. So there is some uncertainty and with that slight downshift, we've allowed ourselves a little bit of cushion for that uncertainty. As it relates to EPS, we're dealing with a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
You'll notice that our third quarter tax rate came in very favorably to forecast. I really need to call out our people. They did a wonderful job of bringing back this offshore cash at a lower rate than we originally expected. So that drove lower tax rate, lower interest expense, our people have done a great job of cash generation. So we have more cash, lower interest rates from a macro perspective. So that's driving part of it. We're also seeing improved margins, again, from the deflation and from the terrific job that our people have done on the restructuring of the Furniture Products segment. So weld that altogether, slight downdraft on top line. Again, it's just a testament to macro uncertainty and a pickup in EPS for all the reasons I listed."

In answer to your question, has deflation -- it definitely has impacted topline there significantly. 
We kind of knew at the time of the acquisition and the months leading it up that we were looking at some pretty historically high chemical input cost, and that those were likely to fall over time. 
But more importantly, we wanted to look at what ECS could generate in terms of margins through that downturn. And as that began to turn around, and we became comfortable with our ability to recoup those costs, when and assuredly, they will go up at some point over time, it's a commodity. But we became really comfortable with the pricing power in the marketplace, with the uniqueness of the product offerings that they had and the position they had in the value chain. So there's a comment in our release with regards to 28% increase in their finished mattress products year-on-year. That's a total of -- if you took the historical 2018 ECS and the Leggett pieces that were produced in terms of finished mattresses and then you just look at this year, the total amount is up 28%. So that certainly met our expectations in terms of double-digit growth, it's just kind of hidden a little bit because of the massive deflation impacts that we've seen."

Yes, it's really more of an industry phenomenon there. We saw the global industrial truck unit volume, which includes material handling equipment, which is the core market for PHC were down about 5.4% year-over-year Q3 and down almost 8% in the second quarter. And our customers there, which are generally the leading forklift producers are seeing demand drop 10% to 15% in North America and 15% to 20% in Europe. So we're seeing those declines in our business early as the supply chain catches up to the long lead times that we had in 2017 and 2018, when volumes were up over 15%. 
We're going from an environment where we couldn't keep up to now one where we see pretty significant declines in demand. So that's really the phenomenon there. 
Interestingly, our earnings were roughly flat because last year, we were struggling to pass through raw material cost inflation. So that's what relates to your pricing comments. Basically, we just caught up our pricing to the material cost, which sort of offset the volume declines that we had this year. So we're taking action to reduce headcounts and take other cost out in response to the volume declines that we see coming."

So we think that restructuring that had its intended effect but also put us in a position to be more stable and more profitable going forward. 
To your anniversary, I think our Home Furniture will probably see that we're don't have full year this year of some of the business that we exited, so we'll see a little bit impact from a sales standpoint next year, but I think we'll see continued margin improvement. 
And then from a Fashion Bed standpoint, we're pretty well ramped down by the end of the third quarter from a sales standpoint. So I'm trying to really remember here, so we basically have no sales repeating next year. We have a small hospitality business that we're looking to exit but that's about $15 million.

The number of pieces in the demand environment we have seen in terms of just sheer numbers, not only looking at mattresses. But in some of the other important parts of their business in finished foam products generally toppers, pillows, those types of things. Yes, we have seen tremendous demand growth there. We have actually and had certain points over the last quarter, where we have throttled back some of our order acceptance because we just simply had some capacity concerns, which we are addressing as we speak. We've added lines for additional mattress production. We changed some floor layouts and things in order to get better efficiencies within our manufacturing operations. But again, that handicapped when you look at it in terms of dollars by the overall, pretty-severe, deflationary environment. Again, a little under half at last count of our mattress volume in that space was under contract. So we see much as we do and are still related businesses. We see a kind of a delayed deflation picture as we take those decreases down.

First, I want to welcome Jeff Tate, our new CFO to our team and to introduce him. As most of you are likely aware, Jeff joined Leggett & Platt in September from the Dow Chemical Company, where he most recently served as Vice President and business CFO for their largest operating segment: packaging and specialty plastics with combined revenue of over $24 billion. 
Jeff was a member of the portfolio executive team, where he drove financial discipline and provided financial counsel at the strategic and operational levels of the business. 
His responsibilities included portfolio analysis, value-based strategy development, business risk analysis, short- and long-term financial planning, performance measurement and analysis and in ensuring proper internal controls. 
In prior roles, Jeff led Dow's global internal audit activities and was Director of Investor Relations. 
Jeff is a certified public accountant with a BS in accounting from the University of Alabama. He is a member of the Board of Directors of TCF Financial Corporation, where he serves as chair of the finance committee and as a member of the audit risk management and compensation and pension committees. 
He also previously served on the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Standing Advisory Group. Jeff brings tremendous strategic and financial capabilities to Leggett. He is well aligned with our culture and is a strong addition to our senior management team. 
Welcome, Jeff. We are excited you are here. 
I also want to recognize Perry Davis. As I mentioned last quarter, Perry is retiring in early 2020 after nearly 40 years with Leggett & Platt. And this will be his last earnings call as a participant. We will miss you, Perry, and I suspect that you won't miss participating in these conference calls going forward. 
We have several items to highlight in our third quarter results. Yesterday, we reported third quarter sales growth of 14%, third quarter EBIT growth of 16% and adjusted EBIT growth of 19%. 
Third quarter earnings per share were $0.74 and adjusted EPS was $0.76, a 15% increase over third quarter 2018 adjusted EPS. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was a strong $213 million. Adjusted working capital was a percent of annualized sales for the quarter improved to 10.7%. 
Our results show the focus our teams have on cash generation. Your efforts are much appreciated. Third quarter sales were $1.24 billion, growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. 
Organic sales were down 2%, 1% from volume and 1% from deflation and a negative currency impact. 
Our Automotive, U.S. Spring and Work Furniture businesses had solid third quarter sales growth, offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 4% and weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. 
Absent declines from exited business, volume was up 3%. Our Bedding businesses continued to perform well with U.S. Spring sales up 6% in the quarter. Finished mattress units were up 28% in the third quarter, including year-over-year growth at ECS. 
Automotive sales were up 8% in the quarter and Work Furniture was up 6%. Third quarter 2019 earnings per share were $0.74, this included $4 million of restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.02 per share. 
Third quarter 2018 EPS of $0.67 included a $0.01 per share benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.76 were up $0.10 from adjusted 2018 third quarter earnings, reflecting higher EBIT and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense, lower raw material cost, including the LIFO benefit and improved earnings performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 50 basis points to 11.9% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.8%. The restructuring activities we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses are substantially complete. 
With the segments adjusted EBIT of $12 million and adjusted EBIT margin of a notable 470 basis points in the quarter, we are already seeing a positive impact from the lower fixed cost and improved pricing. We have further restructuring in the third quarter from the closure of a small machinery facility in our residential products segment and a wire drawing facility in our Industrial Products segment. 
We now expect full year restructuring-related charges of $14 million, $7 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the Automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the global markets is down 6% and is expected to be down approximately 6% for the full year. Our Automotive business grew 8% versus third quarter 2018, exceeding global market growth by over 1,000 basis points. This year, we should exceed market growth by 600 to 700 basis points. We remain confident in our continued strong performance. Ongoing disruption of the global markets makes it difficult to predict our relative performance with precision. 
Accordingly, we are moving away from our specific goal of exceeding market growth by 1,000 basis points. Although, we still expect to significantly outperform the market over the long term. 
In mid-October, we received more positive news from the United States mattress industries antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a final determination that Chinese mattresses are being sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws and imposed final antidumping duties that ranged from 57% to 1,732%. 
Importantly, approximately 90% of Chinese mattresses are now subject to antidumping duties in excess of 160%. We expect the United States International Trade Commission to make a final determination in the antidumping matter no later than the 1st week of December. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

As previously mentioned, operating cash flow was a strong $213 million in the third quarter, an increase of $86 million versus the same quarter last year. Another quarter of key focus on working capital levels was reflected by our quarter and adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.7%, an improvement versus 12.4% in the second quarter and 12% in the third quarter of 2018. 
We now expect our full year operating cash flow to exceed $550 million. Demonstrating our ongoing capital discipline, we are reducing our full year capital expenditure estimate from $180 million to $160 million, and dividend should require $205 million for the year. 
Through the third quarter of 2019, we have returned over $180 million of offshore cash and expect to bring back an additional $50 million before year end. This significantly exceeds our original full year expectation to bring back $170 million of offshore cash. 
We ended the quarter with debt at 3.15x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, an improvement over second quarter's 3.45x. 
As we announced yesterday, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance range for 2019 to $2.40 to $2.55 from a range of $2.30 to $2.50, including approximately $0.08 per share of restructuring related costs. 
Accordingly, full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $2.48 to $2.63. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin range should be 11% to 11.3%. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 22%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest expense of $85 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. 
We are narrowing our full year sales guidance expectations to $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, or up 10% to 12% over last year. Acquisitions should add 15% year-over-year growth. We expect our organic sales to be down 3% to 5%, including a 3% reduction from planned exited businesses in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. 
We also expect full year sales growth in U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture, Adjustable Bed and Aerospace. 
And finally, as I close, we invite you to our Investor Day on Monday, November 18 in New York City. We will webcast the event, which will take place from 8:30 a.m. to noon Eastern Time. The webcast and slides will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please contact Investor Relations for more information and to sign up. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

And of that Comfort Core, our Quantum Edge products are those products that have basically replaced phone with springs. As a percent of Comfort Core Quantum Edge and Edge enhanced products are about 48% of the total Comfort Core. So it's almost half at this point, well beyond what I thought. I thought at one point, we might top out at about 40%, that's not the case and more and more customers are seeing the value, both in their manufacturing efficiencies and in the true benefits that can be demonstrated to the consumer in those spring-enhanced products. By the way, that's -- it's not inconsequential also that we're seeing more and more of that product in compressed rolled mattresses as a built-in Edge support.

We saw sales tick down slightly at the midpoint but EPS come up -- actually come up versus prior expectations.

Is it further incremental deflation, uncertainty around auto or uncertainty around the external sales for wire? And then maybe connect that on what's driving the EPS a little bit higher as well?"

Sales midpoint that slight reduction uncertainty is really the key word. 
Deflation has become more apparent, scrap has traded off more aggressively since we issued last guidance than we expected. So we're starting to see some reduced selling prices first in the industrial segment that will ultimately move to residential. That's actually good for margins because of the delayed lag. So it's kind of a negative positive, if that makes any sense. And as we continue on, you hit it. The IHS data on Automotive continues to reduce at a kind of an accelerated rate. We think the majority of that was the -- was caused by the GM strike. So from our data point, we would have had the impact of the strike for just a couple of weeks in the third quarter, certainly all of October in the fourth quarter. And even though the autoworkers have ratified the election that we don't know to what degree that the supply chain will ramp up. So there is some uncertainty and with that slight downshift, we've allowed ourselves a little bit of cushion for that uncertainty. As it relates to EPS, we're dealing with a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
You'll notice that our third quarter tax rate came in very favorably to forecast. I really need to call out our people. They did a wonderful job of bringing back this offshore cash at a lower rate than we originally expected. So that drove lower tax rate, lower interest expense, our people have done a great job of cash generation. So we have more cash, lower interest rates from a macro perspective. So that's driving part of it. We're also seeing improved margins, again, from the deflation and from the terrific job that our people have done on the restructuring of the Furniture Products segment. So weld that altogether, slight downdraft on top line. Again, it's just a testament to macro uncertainty and a pickup in EPS for all the reasons I listed."

In answer to your question, has deflation -- it definitely has impacted topline there significantly. 
We kind of knew at the time of the acquisition and the months leading it up that we were looking at some pretty historically high chemical input cost, and that those were likely to fall over time. 
But more importantly, we wanted to look at what ECS could generate in terms of margins through that downturn. And as that began to turn around, and we became comfortable with our ability to recoup those costs, when and assuredly, they will go up at some point over time, it's a commodity. But we became really comfortable with the pricing power in the marketplace, with the uniqueness of the product offerings that they had and the position they had in the value chain. So there's a comment in our release with regards to 28% increase in their finished mattress products year-on-year. That's a total of -- if you took the historical 2018 ECS and the Leggett pieces that were produced in terms of finished mattresses and then you just look at this year, the total amount is up 28%. So that certainly met our expectations in terms of double-digit growth, it's just kind of hidden a little bit because of the massive deflation impacts that we've seen."

Yes, it's really more of an industry phenomenon there. We saw the global industrial truck unit volume, which includes material handling equipment, which is the core market for PHC were down about 5.4% year-over-year Q3 and down almost 8% in the second quarter. And our customers there, which are generally the leading forklift producers are seeing demand drop 10% to 15% in North America and 15% to 20% in Europe. So we're seeing those declines in our business early as the supply chain catches up to the long lead times that we had in 2017 and 2018, when volumes were up over 15%. 
We're going from an environment where we couldn't keep up to now one where we see pretty significant declines in demand. So that's really the phenomenon there. 
Interestingly, our earnings were roughly flat because last year, we were struggling to pass through raw material cost inflation. So that's what relates to your pricing comments. Basically, we just caught up our pricing to the material cost, which sort of offset the volume declines that we had this year.

So we think that restructuring that had its intended effect but also put us in a position to be more stable and more profitable going forward. 
To your anniversary, I think our Home Furniture will probably see that we're don't have full year this year of some of the business that we exited, so we'll see a little bit impact from a sales standpoint next year, but I think we'll see continued margin improvement. 
And then from a Fashion Bed standpoint, we're pretty well ramped down by the end of the third quarter from a sales standpoint. So I'm trying to really remember here, so we basically have no sales repeating next year. We have a small hospitality business that we're looking to exit but that's about $15 million.

The number of pieces in the demand environment we have seen in terms of just sheer numbers, not only looking at mattresses. But in some of the other important parts of their business in finished foam products generally toppers, pillows, those types of things. Yes, we have seen tremendous demand growth there. We have actually and had certain points over the last quarter, where we have throttled back some of our order acceptance because we just simply had some capacity concerns, which we are addressing as we speak. We've added lines for additional mattress production. We changed some floor layouts and things in order to get better efficiencies within our manufacturing operations. But again, that handicapped when you look at it in terms of dollars by the overall, pretty-severe, deflationary environment. Again, a little under half at last count of our mattress volume in that space was under contract. So we see much as we do and are still related businesses. We see a kind of a delayed deflation picture as we take those decreases down. And they don't all happen at once, they happen over time because we saw an incremental step down in our raw material inputs."

First, I want to welcome Jeff Tate, our new CFO, to our team and to introduce him. As most of you are likely aware, Jeff joined Leggett & Platt in September from the Dow Chemical Company, where he most recently served as Vice President and business CFO for their largest operating segment, packaging and specialty plastics, with combined revenue of over $24 billion. 
Jeff was a member of the portfolio executive team, where he drove financial discipline and provided financial counsel at the strategic and operational levels of the business. 
His responsibilities included portfolio analysis, value-based strategy development, business risk analysis, short- and long-term financial planning, performance measurement and analysis and in ensuring proper internal controls. 
In prior roles, Jeff led Dow's global internal audit activities and was Director of Investor Relations. 
Jeff is a certified public accountant with a BS in accounting from the University of Alabama. He is a member of the Board of Directors of TCF Financial Corporation, where he serves as chair of the finance committee and as a member of the audit risk management and compensation and pension committees. 
He also previously served on the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Standing Advisory Group. Jeff brings tremendous strategic and financial capabilities to Leggett. He is well aligned with our culture and is a strong addition to our senior management team. 
Welcome, Jeff. We are excited you are here. 
I also want to recognize Perry Davis. As I mentioned last quarter, Perry is retiring in early 2020 after nearly 40 years with Leggett & Platt. And this will be his last earnings call as a participant. We will miss you, Perry, and I suspect that you won't miss participating in these conference calls going forward. 
We have several items to highlight in our third quarter results. Yesterday, we reported third quarter sales growth of 14%, third quarter EBIT growth of 16% and adjusted EBIT growth of 19%. 
Third quarter earnings per share were $0.74 and adjusted EPS was $0.76, a 15% increase over third quarter 2018 adjusted EPS. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was a strong $213 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales for the quarter improved to 10.7%. 
Our results show the focus our teams have on cash generation. Your efforts are much appreciated. Third quarter sales were $1.24 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. Organic sales were down 2%, 1% from volume and 1% from deflation and a negative currency impact. 
Our Automotive, U.S. Spring and Work Furniture businesses had solid third quarter sales growth, offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 4%, and weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. 
Absent declines from exited business, volume was up 3%. Our Bedding businesses continued to perform well, with U.S. Spring sales up 6% in the quarter. Finished mattress units were up 28% in the third quarter, including year-over-year growth at ECS. 
Automotive sales were up 8% in the quarter and Work Furniture was up 6%. Third quarter 2019 earnings per share were $0.74. This included $4 million of restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.02 per share. 
Third quarter 2018 EPS of $0.67 included a $0.01 per share benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.76 were up $0.10 from adjusted 2018 third quarter earnings, reflecting higher EBIT and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense, lower raw material cost, including the LIFO benefit, and improved earnings performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 50 basis points to 11.9% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.8%. The restructuring activities we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses are substantially complete. 
With the segments adjusted EBIT of $12 million and adjusted EBIT margin up a notable 470 basis points in the quarter, we are already seeing a positive impact from a lower fixed cost and improved pricing. We have further restructuring in the third quarter from the closure of a small machinery facility in our Residential Products segment and a wire drawing facility in our Industrial Products segment. 
We now expect full year restructuring-related charges of $14 million, $7 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the global markets is down 6% and is expected to be down approximately 6% for the full year. Our Automotive business grew 8% versus third quarter 2018, exceeding global market growth by over 1,000 basis points. This year, we should exceed market growth by 600 to 700 basis points. We remain confident in our continued strong performance. Ongoing disruption of the global markets makes it difficult to predict our relative performance with precision. Accordingly, we are moving away from our specific goal of exceeding market growth by 1,000 basis points, although we still expect to significantly outperform the market over the long term. 
In mid-October, we received more positive news from the United States mattress industry's antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a final determination that Chinese mattresses are being sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws and imposed final antidumping duties that ranged from 57% to 1,732%. 
Importantly, approximately 90% of Chinese mattresses are now subject to antidumping duties in excess of 160%. We expect the United States International Trade Commission to make a final determination in the antidumping matter no later than the 1st week of December. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

As previously mentioned, operating cash flow was a strong $213 million in the third quarter, an increase of $86 million versus the same quarter last year.

As previously mentioned, operating cash flow was a strong $213 million in the third quarter, an increase of $86 million versus the same quarter last year. Another quarter of key focus on working capital levels was reflected by our quarter-end adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.7%, an improvement versus 12.4% in the second quarter and 12% in the third quarter of 2018. 
We now expect our full year operating cash flow to exceed $550 million. Demonstrating our ongoing capital discipline, we are reducing our full year capital expenditure estimate from $180 million to $160 million, and dividends should require $205 million for the year. 
Through the third quarter of 2019, we have returned over $180 million of offshore cash and expect to bring back an additional $50 million before year end. This significantly exceeds our original full year expectation to bring back $170 million of offshore cash. 
We ended the quarter with debt at 3.15x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, an improvement over second quarter's 3.45x. 
As we announced yesterday, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance range for 2019 to $2.40 to $2.55 from a range of $2.30 to $2.50, including approximately $0.08 per share of restructuring related costs. 
Accordingly, full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $2.48 to $2.63. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin range should be 11% to 11.3%. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 22%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest expense of $85 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. 
We are narrowing our full year sales guidance expectations to $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, or up 10% to 12% over last year. Acquisitions should add 15% year-over-year growth. We expect our organic sales to be down 3% to 5%, including a 3% reduction from planned exited business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. 
We also expect full year sales growth in U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture, Adjustable Bed and Aerospace. 
And finally, as I close, we invite you to our Investor Day on Monday, November 18 in New York City. We will webcast the event, which will take place from 8:30 a.m. to noon Eastern Time. The webcast and slides will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please contact Investor Relations for more information and to sign up. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

And of that Comfort Core, our Quantum Edge products are those products that have basically replaced foam with springs. As a percent of Comfort Core, Quantum Edge and edge-enhanced products are about 48% of the total Comfort Core. So it's almost half at this point, well beyond what I thought. I thought at one point, we might top out at about 40%. That's not the case, and more and more customers are seeing the value, both in their manufacturing efficiencies and in the true benefits that can be demonstrated to the consumer in those spring-enhanced products.

And then lastly for me, I was hoping maybe just to get a little more detail around the moving parts with updated full year guidance. We saw sales tick down slightly at the midpoint but EPS come up -- actually come up versus prior expectations. Can you maybe unpack a little bit of what's first driving the sales reduction at the midpoint? Is it further incremental deflation, uncertainty around auto or uncertainty around the external sales for wire? And then maybe connect that on what's driving the EPS a little bit higher as well?"

Really the changes, since we last issued guidance, which as you know, was the end of July, sales midpoint, that slight reduction uncertainty is really the key word. 
Deflation has become more apparent, scrap has traded off more aggressively since we issued last guidance than we expected. So we're starting to see some reduced selling prices first in the industrial segment that will ultimately move to residential. That's actually good for margins because of the delayed lag. So it's kind of a negative positive, if that makes any sense. And as we continue on, you hit it. The IHS data on automotive continues to reduce at a kind of an accelerated rate. We think the majority of that was the -- was caused by the GM strike. So from our data point, we would have had the impact of the strike for just a couple of weeks in the third quarter, certainly all of October in the fourth quarter. And even though the autoworkers have ratified the election, that we don't know to what degree that the supply chain will ramp up. So there is some uncertainty and with that slight downshift, we've allowed ourselves a little bit of cushion for that uncertainty.
As it relates to EPS, we're dealing with a lower-than-expected tax rate. You'll notice that our third quarter tax rate came in very favorably to forecast. I really need to call out our people. They did a wonderful job of bringing back this offshore cash at a lower rate than we originally expected. So that drove lower tax rate, lower interest expense, our people have done a great job of cash generation. So we have more cash, lower interest rates from a macro perspective. So that's driving part of it. We're also seeing improved margins, again, from the deflation and from the terrific job that our people have done on the restructuring of the Furniture Products segment. So roll that all together, slight downdraft on top line. Again, it's just a testament to macro uncertainty and a pickup in EPS for all the reasons I listed."

In answer to your question, has deflation -- it definitely has impacted topline there significantly. We kind of knew at the time of the acquisition and the months leading it up that we were looking at some pretty historically high chemical input costs, and that those were likely to fall over time. 
But more importantly, we wanted to look at what ECS could generate in terms of margins through that downturn. And as that began to turn around, and we became comfortable with our ability to recoup those costs, when -- and assuredly, they will go up at some point over time; it's a commodity. But we became really comfortable with the pricing power in the marketplace, with the uniqueness of the product offerings that they had and the position they had in the value chain. So there's a comment in our release with regards to a 28% increase in their finished mattress products year-on-year. That's a total of -- if you took the historical 2018 ECS and the Leggett pieces that were produced in terms of finished mattresses and then you just look at this year, the total amount is up 28%. So that certainly met our expectations in terms of double-digit growth. It's just kind of hidden a little bit because of the massive deflation impacts that we've seen."

We saw the global industrial truck unit volume, which includes material handling equipment, which is the core market for PHC, were down, oh, 5.4% year-over-year Q3 and down almost 8% in the second quarter. And our customers there, which are generally the leading forklift producers, are seeing demand drop 10% to 15% in North America and 15% to 20% in Europe. So we're seeing those declines in our business early as the supply chain catches up to the long lead times that we had in 2017 and 2018, when volumes were up over 15%. We're going from an environment where we couldn't keep up to now one where we see pretty significant declines in demand. So that's really the phenomenon there. 
Interestingly, our earnings were roughly flat because last year, we were struggling to pass through raw material cost inflation. So that's what relates to your pricing comments. Basically, we just caught up our pricing to the material cost, which sort of offset the volume declines that we had this year. So we're taking action to reduce headcounts and take other costs out in response to the volume declines that we see coming."

To your anniversary, I think our Home Furniture will probably see that we're -- don't have full year this year of some of the business that we exited, so we'll see a little bit of impact from a sales standpoint next year, but I think we'll see continued margin improvement. 
And then from a Fashion Bed standpoint, we're pretty well ramped down by the end of the third quarter from a sales standpoint. So I'm trying to -- let me remember here, so we basically have no sales repeating next year. We have a small hospitality business that we're looking to exit but that's about $15 million.

Bear in mind, in the U.S., we play in all the different areas of the value chain pretty strongly, whether it's promotional to premium. In Europe, not so much the case. We tend to trend more towards the upper end or the mid-upper end part of the markets where Comfort Core as a percentage of a total innersprings in Europe represents a higher percentage of our sales.

But again, that handicapped when you look at it in terms of dollars by the, overall, pretty severe deflationary environment. Again, a little under half, at last count, of our mattress volume in that space was under contract. So we see, much as we do in our steel-related businesses, we see a kind of a delayed deflation picture as we take those decreases down. And they don't all happen at once, they happen over time because we saw an incremental step down in our raw material inputs."

First, I want to welcome Jeff Tate, our new CFO, to our team and to introduce him. As most of you are likely aware, Jeff joined Leggett & Platt in September from the Dow Chemical Company, where he most recently served as Vice President and business CFO for their largest operating segment, packaging and specialty plastics, with combined revenue of over $24 billion. 
Jeff was a member of the portfolio executive team, where he drove financial discipline and provided financial counsel at the strategic and operational levels of the business. 
His responsibilities included portfolio analysis, value-based strategy development, business risk analysis, short- and long-term financial planning, performance measurement and analysis and in ensuring proper internal controls. 
In prior roles, Jeff led Dow's global internal audit activities and was Director of Investor Relations. 
Jeff is a certified public accountant with a BS in accounting from the University of Alabama. He is a member of the Board of Directors of TCF Financial Corporation, where he serves as chair of the finance committee and as a member of the audit risk management and compensation and pension committees. 
He also previously served on the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Standing Advisory Group. Jeff brings tremendous strategic and financial capabilities to Leggett. He is well aligned with our culture and is a strong addition to our senior management team. 
Welcome, Jeff. We are excited you are here. 
I also want to recognize Perry Davis. As I mentioned last quarter, Perry is retiring in early 2020 after nearly 40 years with Leggett & Platt. And this will be his last earnings call as a participant. We will miss you, Perry, and I suspect that you won't miss participating in these conference calls going forward. 
We have several items to highlight in our third quarter results. Yesterday, we reported third quarter sales growth of 14%, third quarter EBIT growth of 16% and adjusted EBIT growth of 19%. 
Third quarter earnings per share were $0.74 and adjusted EPS was $0.76, a 15% increase over third quarter 2018 adjusted EPS. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was a strong $213 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales for the quarter improved to 10.7%. 
Our results show the focus our teams have on cash generation. Your efforts are much appreciated. Third quarter sales were $1.24 billion. Growth from ECS and other smaller acquisitions was 16% in the quarter. Organic sales were down 2%, 1% from volume and 1% from deflation and a negative currency impact. 
Our Automotive, U.S. Spring and Work Furniture businesses had solid third quarter sales growth, offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 4%, and weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. 
Absent declines from exited business, volume was up 3%. Our Bedding businesses continued to perform well, with U.S. Spring sales up 6% in the quarter. Finished mattress units were up 28% in the third quarter, including year-over-year growth at ECS. 
Automotive sales were up 8% in the quarter and Work Furniture was up 6%. Third quarter 2019 earnings per share were $0.74. This included $4 million of restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.02 per share. 
Third quarter 2018 EPS of $0.67 included a $0.01 per share benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.76 were up $0.10 from adjusted 2018 third quarter earnings, reflecting higher EBIT and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense, lower raw material cost, including the LIFO benefit, and improved earnings performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 50 basis points to 11.9% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 15.8%. The restructuring activities we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our Home Furniture and Fashion Bed businesses are substantially complete. 
With the segments adjusted EBIT of $12 million and adjusted EBIT margin up a notable 470 basis points in the quarter, we are already seeing a positive impact from a lower fixed cost and improved pricing. We have further restructuring in the third quarter from the closure of a small machinery facility in our Residential Products segment and a wire drawing facility in our Industrial Products segment. 
We now expect full year restructuring-related charges of $14 million, $7 million of which is noncash. 
We also wanted to update you on the automotive market. Year-to-date, production in the global markets is down 6% and is expected to be down approximately 6% for the full year. Our Automotive business grew 8% versus third quarter 2018, exceeding global market growth by over 1,000 basis points. This year, we should exceed market growth by 600 to 700 basis points. We remain confident in our continued strong performance. Ongoing disruption of the global markets makes it difficult to predict our relative performance with precision. Accordingly, we are moving away from our specific goal of exceeding market growth by 1,000 basis points, although we still expect to significantly outperform the market over the long term. 
In mid-October, we received more positive news from the United States mattress industry's antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses. The Department of Commerce made a final determination that Chinese mattresses are being sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws and imposed final antidumping duties that ranged from 57% to 1,732%. 
Importantly, approximately 90% of Chinese mattresses are now subject to antidumping duties in excess of 160%. We expect the United States International Trade Commission to make a final determination in the antidumping matter no later than the 1st week of December. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

As previously mentioned, operating cash flow was a strong $213 million in the third quarter, an increase of $86 million versus the same quarter last year.

As previously mentioned, operating cash flow was a strong $213 million in the third quarter, an increase of $86 million versus the same quarter last year. Another quarter of key focus on working capital levels was reflected by our quarter-end adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10.7%, an improvement versus 12.4% in the second quarter and 12% in the third quarter of 2018. 
We now expect our full year operating cash flow to exceed $550 million. Demonstrating our ongoing capital discipline, we are reducing our full year capital expenditure estimate from $180 million to $160 million, and dividends should require $205 million for the year. 
Through the third quarter of 2019, we have returned over $180 million of offshore cash and expect to bring back an additional $50 million before year end. This significantly exceeds our original full year expectation to bring back $170 million of offshore cash. 
We ended the quarter with debt at 3.15x our trailing 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA, an improvement over second quarter's 3.45x. 
As we announced yesterday, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance range for 2019 to $2.40 to $2.55 from a range of $2.30 to $2.50, including approximately $0.08 per share of restructuring related costs. 
Accordingly, full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $2.48 to $2.63. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our full year adjusted EBIT margin range should be 11% to 11.3%. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 22%, full year depreciation and amortization of $200 million, net interest expense of $85 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. 
We are narrowing our full year sales guidance expectations to $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, or up 10% to 12% over last year. Acquisitions should add 15% year-over-year growth. We expect our organic sales to be down 3% to 5%, including a 3% reduction from planned exited business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. 
We also expect full year sales growth in U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture, Adjustable Bed and Aerospace. 
And finally, as I close, we invite you to our Investor Day on Monday, November 18 in New York City. We will webcast the event, which will take place from 8:30 a.m. to noon Eastern Time. The webcast and slides will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please contact Investor Relations for more information and to sign up. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

So now as a percentage of total innersprings in our business, if you look at Comfort Core, it's about 60% run rate in the third quarter. And of that Comfort Core, our Quantum Edge products are those products that have basically replaced foam with springs. As a percent of Comfort Core, Quantum Edge and edge-enhanced products are about 48% of the total Comfort Core. So it's almost half at this point, well beyond what I thought. I thought at one point, we might top out at about 40%. That's not the case, and more and more customers are seeing the value, both in their manufacturing efficiencies and in the true benefits that can be demonstrated to the consumer in those spring-enhanced products. By the way, that's -- it's not inconsequential also that we're seeing more and more of that product in compressed rolled mattresses as a built-in edge support.

Really the changes, since we last issued guidance, which as you know, was the end of July, sales midpoint, that slight reduction uncertainty is really the key word. 
Deflation has become more apparent, scrap has traded off more aggressively since we issued last guidance than we expected. So we're starting to see some reduced selling prices first in the industrial segment that will ultimately move to residential. That's actually good for margins because of the delayed lag. So it's kind of a negative positive, if that makes any sense. And as we continue on, you hit it. The IHS data on automotive continues to reduce at a kind of an accelerated rate. We think the majority of that was the -- was caused by the GM strike. So from our data point, we would have had the impact of the strike for just a couple of weeks in the third quarter, certainly all of October in the fourth quarter. And even though the autoworkers have ratified the election, that we don't know to what degree that the supply chain will ramp up. So there is some uncertainty and with that slight downshift, we've allowed ourselves a little bit of cushion for that uncertainty.
As it relates to EPS, we're dealing with a lower-than-expected tax rate. You'll notice that our third quarter tax rate came in very favorably to forecast. I really need to call out our people. They did a wonderful job of bringing back this offshore cash at a lower rate than we originally expected. So that drove lower tax rate, lower interest expense, our people have done a great job of cash generation. So we have more cash, lower interest rates from a macro perspective. So that's driving part of it. We're also seeing improved margins, again, from the deflation and from the terrific job that our people have done on the restructuring of the Furniture Products segment. So roll that all together, slight downdraft on top line. Again, it's just a testament to macro uncertainty and a pickup in EPS for all the reasons I listed."

In answer to your question, has deflation -- it definitely has impacted topline there significantly. We kind of knew at the time of the acquisition and the months leading it up that we were looking at some pretty historically high chemical input costs, and that those were likely to fall over time. 
But more importantly, we wanted to look at what ECS could generate in terms of margins through that downturn. And as that began to turn around, and we became comfortable with our ability to recoup those costs, when -- and assuredly, they will go up at some point over time; it's a commodity. But we became really comfortable with the pricing power in the marketplace, with the uniqueness of the product offerings that they had and the position they had in the value chain. So there's a comment in our release with regards to a 28% increase in their finished mattress products year-on-year. That's a total of -- if you took the historical 2018 ECS and the Leggett pieces that were produced in terms of finished mattresses and then you just look at this year, the total amount is up 28%. So that certainly met our expectations in terms of double-digit growth. It's just kind of hidden a little bit because of the massive deflation impacts that we've seen."

Yes, it's really more of an industry phenomenon there. We saw the global industrial truck unit volume, which includes material handling equipment, which is the core market for PHC, were down, oh, 5.4% year-over-year Q3 and down almost 8% in the second quarter. And our customers there, which are generally the leading forklift producers, are seeing demand drop 10% to 15% in North America and 15% to 20% in Europe. So we're seeing those declines in our business early as the supply chain catches up to the long lead times that we had in 2017 and 2018, when volumes were up over 15%. We're going from an environment where we couldn't keep up to now one where we see pretty significant declines in demand. So that's really the phenomenon there. 
Interestingly, our earnings were roughly flat because last year, we were struggling to pass through raw material cost inflation. So that's what relates to your pricing comments. Basically, we just caught up our pricing to the material cost, which sort of offset the volume declines that we had this year. So we're taking action to reduce headcounts and take other costs out in response to the volume declines that we see coming."

To your anniversary, I think our Home Furniture will probably see that we're -- don't have full year this year of some of the business that we exited, so we'll see a little bit of impact from a sales standpoint next year, but I think we'll see continued margin improvement. 
And then from a Fashion Bed standpoint, we're pretty well ramped down by the end of the third quarter from a sales standpoint. So I'm trying to -- let me remember here, so we basically have no sales repeating next year. We have a small hospitality business that we're looking to exit but that's about $15 million.

Bear in mind, in the U.S., we play in all the different areas of the value chain pretty strongly, whether it's promotional to premium. In Europe, not so much the case. We tend to trend more towards the upper end or the mid-upper end part of the markets where Comfort Core as a percentage of a total innersprings in Europe represents a higher percentage of our sales.
