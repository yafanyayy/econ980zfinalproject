I have one quarter under my belt and I'm learning more and more about the business every day. My early observations of what the key issues facing Perrigo are and what we need to do to fix the business remain largely unchanged",1741,"Good afternoon, everyone. 
I have one quarter under my belt and I'm learning more and more about the business every day. 
My early observations of what the key issues facing Perrigo are and what we need to do to fix the business remain largely unchanged and can be summarized as follows: first, the challenges that we face are fixable. The more time I've spent with the business, the more I become comfortable that we cannot only take Perrigo back to its prior strength, but that we can build on the platform to be even stronger. 
Second, new product volume and core brand innovation over the last few years has not been sufficient to offset increased price competition in the USA. 
Third, increased organizational complexity and lack of sufficient investment in capacity and technology has reduced the company's service levels and competitive advantage in an area that has historically been a core competency for Perrigo and, which inside the company we rightly call the Perrigo Advantage. 
Fourth, overhangs of which the recent [ $1.6 billion ] Euro Irish notice of assessment is the most meaningful and, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes are a distraction and a resource strain. 
Fifth, over the last few years, Perrigo has not made the type of investments that had driven the company's success for so many years. That is a robust pipeline of new products and smaller bolt-on acquisitions. 
Sixth, our international consumer business is a good business with attractive upside potential, but has a legacy of having been managed as an amalgamation of many small businesses. 
Great progress has been made restructuring that business and reducing complexity, but there is much more to be done in order to enhance performance and margins. 
Overall, I like the business and it is performing better than most investors realize. 
Seventh, our generic RX business has diversified in highly differentiated pharmaceutical business, but when RX is, combined with our consumer businesses, both become neglected. 
I continue to support the board's decision to separate the company's so they both can reach their full potential. 
Eighth, there is great talent within the company that was waiting to be unleashed and that is being done. There are also some important capability and still gaps that need to be addressed in the area of consumer marketing, R&D, innovation and business intelligence. Those voids have been filled with great talent both externally and internally. 
And ninth, the company's recent earnings guidance revisions have frustrated investors. While the fourth quarter results for relatively lackluster and negatively impacted by continued executional issues, we delivered exactly what we said we would, despite some pretty significant headwinds, so that's a start. 
Again, all of these issues are fixable and many are being addressed now with specific actions throughout our company. 
Most importantly, we have developed a new strategic plan, designed to help us deliver our new vision, which is to make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care product that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
The plan has been approved by our board, and we are now onto the implementation stage. We will share the full plan at our Investor Day, which has been scheduled for May 9 at the New York Stock Exchange. 
At that meeting, we will review how we are transforming Perrigo from a healthcare to a consumer self-care company to take advantage of a massive global consumer trend. 
We intend to provide detailed plans and actions we have already taken in the areas of portfolio reconfiguration, investments in capacity and technology, innovation initiatives, cost savings plans to help fuel growth, capital allocation plans and organizational effectiveness initiatives, including several key external hires. 
We will also provide calendar year 2019 guidance at that time. 
Turning to the fourth quarter of 2018, let me give you an overview of how I saw consolidated and segment commercial results. 
Reported fourth quarter net sales for the company were $1.2 billion, down 5% versus a year ago on an organic constant-currency basis and adjusted to diluted EPS was $0.97 as we guided, which was down 24% versus a year ago. 
We experienced operating income declines across all 3 of our segments for different reasons, which I'll detail in a minute, but at the 30,000-foot level, the consumer businesses in the Americas were negatively affected by costs and customer service. 
In our international segment, we purposefully invested in advertising and R&D and in RX we continued to suffer from downward pricing pressure, albeit at a lower rate than we had been previously experiencing. 
In the consumer market segment. Consumer offtake and storebrand market share continued to grow. Underlying revenue trends on our core businesses were relatively unchanged. 
Importantly, sales volumes on the base over-the-counter healthcare lines were once again solid, except for animal health, which you are aware of and has been discussed on previous calls. 
Execution in the fourth quarter remained sloppy, which depressed revenues and reduced margins. 
On top of challenged service levels, a significant equipment startup issue in the infant nutrition business resulted in a miss sales opportunity of $10 million with a onetime impact to growth profit of approximately $0.08 of adjusted EPS per share. 
Turning to consumer international. We continued to simplify and upgrade our offerings during 2018 and the fourth quarter. This purposeful pruning of our product lines, which has translated to higher margins mask sell our businesses really performing. 
And our core international OTC brands representing 70% of consumer internationals net sales grew approximately 2.5% for the year and 1.5% for the fourth quarter, holding market share in the European OTC market that grew at roughly the same rate. 
We are especially pleased with momentum we are observing in the dermatological space with our [indiscernible] brand and cough cold and analgesic with our scopolamine brand. 
Fourth quarter advertising and R&D was increased by $13 million or 28% on a constant-currency basis versus last year to keep the momentum going. 
And with the bulk of the product line pruning that has occurred over the last few years behind us, we anticipate top line growth in 2019 for our total international consumer segment. 
I'd also note customer service levels have averaged around 95% for the last year, a testament to this team's focus on keeping our winning brands on the shelves and available to consumers. 
Moving on to RX. It was a better quarter as we started to see the benefits of a solid pipeline of new products begin to positively impact the business in both revenue and margins. 
We saw margin improvement in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, benefiting from the launch of Testosterone 1.62% and an easing of downward pricing pressure. 
Revenues continued to decline year-over-year by approximately 15%, which is half the rate that we experienced in the third quarter. 
We expect this business segment to improve as its new product pipeline continues to come to market. 
For perspective, we have 10 tentative approvals awaiting final action and 65 new product projects under development or under FDA review. 
Also worth noting, customer service levels have been restored to greater than 90% and as it relates to the separation process, I won't comment on where we are right now on the sailor spin on in the Q&A, than to say it is on track and we remain committed to the strategic initiative. 
So in summary, 2018 was a challenging year, but overall, our consumer businesses market shares were stable in growing markets. 
Executional issues are being addressed. We have restored customer service levels in the RX segment and we received the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. 
We have an exciting strategic plan that we believe will transform Perrigo back into a growing company with a bright future as we evolve from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. 
We know that 2019 will be a transformational year that implements the many major changes I have discussed and, which we recognize makes it difficult right now, to forecast our business. It is our intention to bring significant clarity to the strategy and transformation execution as well as provide full year 2019 guidance on May 9. 
One last topic I'd like to cover before I turn the call over to Ron. 2 days ago, Perrigo filed a petition within the Irish High Court because we strongly believe Irish revenues notice of assessment was issued in breach of the company's legitimate expectations regarding how it be treated as a taxpayer. 
As we noted in our prior disclosure related to the Irish tax assessment, we strongly disagree with the assessment and believe that it is without merit and incorrect as a matter of law. 
We also said that the company would pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues that may be necessary or appropriate to challenge this assessment. 
We owe it to our shareholders to take every legitimate step to challenge this assessment and that is why we pursued this action in the Irish court. 
I will not go into the details of this filing other than to say this: First, we believe that Irish revenues assessment conflicts with revenues long-standing tax treatment of a [indiscernible], which was carrying on a trade of international property for over 20 years. 
As noted in the judicial review proceedings, we believe that Irish revenue breached a [indiscernible] legitimate expectation, based on that tax history, when it wrongly recharacterized [indiscernible] pharma's trade some 20 years later in the amended assessment. 
And second, the judicial review proceeding is a separate process that must be pursued in the Irish courts rather than before the tax appeals commission. 
The appeal before the tax appeals commission has been stayed until the court makes a decision in this judicial review proceeding. 
If the court finds that [indiscernible] pharmas legitimate expectation was breached, the court would set aside the entire assessment. 
To be clear, this is a challenge of the process, not the assessment itself. 
If the court does not agree with our assertion, then we will proceed to challenge the tax assessment on its merit in the tax appeals commission. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Ron Winowiecki, to cover more specific financial results for the fourth quarter and the year. 
And while I said that we will not provide full 2019 guidance, until our Investor Day meeting, he will give you some rough planning input as you think about your models. Ron?"
319092,602262835,1671783,"Perrigo Company plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2019",2019-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Perrigo Company plc","Executives","Thank you, Murray, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, with reported net income",1701,"Thank you, Murray, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I will now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. 
On a consolidated basis, reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, with reported net income of $82 million and reported EPS of $0.60 per share. 
A few adjustments to the GAAP P&L this quarter are worth noting. First, we recognized $170 million gain in our P&L resulting from the achievements and receipt of the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. 
As a reminder, we have the potential for another milestone receipt of $400 million in the event 2020 Tysabri sales exceed $1.95 billion. 
In addition, as we continue on our plan of separating the RX business, we expensed $7.3 million, which included a combination of Concorde accounting, tax work streams and operational actions to segregate the business. 
GAAP tax expense as a percentage of pretax income was 60% in the quarter, compared to a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%. The difference was due primarily to the tax effect of the non-GAAP pretax adjustments and the effective valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and liabilities consistent with the adjusted pretax income. 
Now turning to Slide 10. On a consolidated net sales, we're approximately $1.2 billion, 7% lower than the prior year. 
On favorable foreign currency translation impact in net sales by approximately $18 million in the quarter. 
On an organic constant-currency basis, net sales decreased by approximately 5% due to the following: One, RX net sales were down approximately 15% as price erosion and lower volumes impacted the business. RX next sales were slightly above our expectations as we saw year-over-year pricing trends improve in the fourth quarter in our core generic portfolio. 
As we have discussed previously, our inability to supply certain products has resulted in lower volumes. However, it is worth noting that the team has been focusing on correcting these issues and service levels have improved from the low to mid-80% range in mid 2018 to approximately 90% as we sit here today. 
New product sales of $22 million partially offset these declines. 2, net sales in the U.S. animal health business were approximately 50% lower than the prior year. Due to the previously disclosed loss of a partner product and Channel Dynamics. 
In the fourth quarter, excluding the animal health business, on an organic constant-currency basis, our worldwide consumer businesses were approximately 1% lower year-over-year. 
And 3, we experienced a temporary disruption caused by an equipment start up issue at one of our infant formula facilities and as Murray stated, this disruption caused net sales in the quarter to be lower by approximately $10 million. 
I will discuss the startup issue in more detail shortly. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Adjusted gross profit was approximately $490 million or $75 million lower than the prior year. 
CHC Americas adjusted gross profit was more than half of the decline, down approximately $44 million compared to the prior year due to the following factors: first, lower net sales and unfavorable product mix accounted for approximately $15 million of this variance. 
Second, our infant formula plan Ohio had undergone a series of major equipment updates as part of our ongoing investment in capacity to support growth in this business. 
When restarting production in this facility, during the fourth quarter, our quality system identified equipment variations in consistent with our quality control standards. 
Accordingly, inclusive of scrap product and lost sales, gross profit was impacted by approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
We anticipate production to resume early next month. 
Finally, as reported in the third quarter, the CHC Americas business continued to experience lower customer service levels, which led to production and efficiencies and operating variances. These factors, combined with higher year-over-year input cost, impacted gross profit by approximately $16 million. 
CHC International adjusted gross profit was unfavorably impacted by approximately $9 million in the fourth quarter due to currency translation movements. 
In the RX segment, while adjusted gross profit was down in the quarter due to lower net sales, adjusted gross margin was approximately 55%, an increase of 160 basis points, compared to the prior year, driven by the launch of higher-margin new products. 
Slide 12 outlines the primary operating expense drivers in our businesses. In the fourth quarter, we increased growth investments compared to the prior year on a constant-currency basis. 
In our consumer platforms, we prioritized investments to drive long range growth. Specifically, in the consumer international business, plain investments and advertising and R&D were approximately 16.1% as a percentage to net sales, compared to 12.5% in the prior year. 
Likewise, RX R&D investments were approximately 8% to net sales as we continued to invest in our strong pipeline. 
Selling and administrative expenses benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, movements of approximately $6 million, lower compensation accruals in the quarter and continuing improvement actions in the cost structure of our consumer international segment. 
Turning to Slide 13. The major financial drivers I just reviewed resulted in consolidated adjusted operating income of $195 million, compared to $253 million the prior year and a reduction in margins. 
A bit of perspective on margins. Our overall consolidated operating margin for the quarter was 16.3%, down approximately 350 basis points compared to the prior year, due primarily to: 1, production issues in CHC Americas, negative impacted that segments adjusted operating margin by 400 basis points. 
And consolidated Perrigo adjusted margin by 225 basis points and 2, in CHC International, the intentional investments to drive long-term growth in this business impacted the segments suggests operating margin by 350 basis points and consolidated Perrigo adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points. 
These are partially offset by RX where our adjusted operating margin increased year-over-year from 38.1% to 39.2% as we continued to invest in R&D. 
Slide 14 illustrates the overall consolidated adjusted operating results for the fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was consistent with our expectations at approximately 20%. 
Overall, adjusted earnings per share was $0.97, right in the middle of the revised guidance range we provided last call and despite the negative impact of approximately $0.80 per share from the Ohio facility equipment production issue. 
Turning now to Slide 15. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remained strong. Cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 147% for the quarter, which highlights the powerful cash flow generation of our business model. 
Of note, the December 31, 2018 balance sheet does not include the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment we received in the first quarter of 2019. 
Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our long-standing commitment to an investment grade financial policy. 
As Murray highlighted, we are looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will outline our strategic plan and our 2019 guidance framework. 
In the interim, we're highlighting a few key business trends headed into 2019. 
Our consumer businesses continued to grow, led by storebrand penetration and a healthy new product pipeline in our consumer international business. 
And as a reminder, a loss of the partner product in our animal health business will anniversary midyear and will no longer affect year-over-year comparisons, starting in Q3 of 2019. 
Also given the current weakness of certain conferences to the U.S. dollar, translation exposure exported to negatively impact 2019 growth in our consumer businesses by approximately 190 basis points as we stand here today. 
From an operating perspective, in our consumer businesses, there are 2 core macro themes headed into 2019. First, as our service levels in RX and CHC International business are operating above 90%, our top priority is the resolution of the operating variances and customer service dynamics and in Consumer America's segment. 
Actions to improve service in this segment are underway and include one, adding capacity in our [indiscernible] value stream; and 2, important process, technology and structural improvements to drive and sustain operational performance. 
As previously indicated, we are now refocused on regaining the Perrigo Advantage with customer service as a key pillar. 
This is a top priority while we are making progress. It will take time for these actions to be realized in our financial statements. 
As previously inventoried operating variances, royalty or income statement, in 2019, as the inventory sold in the first half of the year. This means the weakness was on the first half of 2018 will depress 2019's first half results in the form of higher cost to product sold. 
Second, we have already begun our strategic investments in various aspects of our consumer businesses as evidenced by the planned increase in advertising within the consumer international segment in the fourth quarter, along with build out of capabilities in R&D, innovation and business intelligence, which will all sort of impact first half results. 
We will show specific actions to help offset these investments at our Investor Day, but they will come later in the year in the form of cost reduction programs. 
Given this operating framework, consumer adjusted operating margins are expected to be lower in the first half of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, improving as we marched to the year. 
Finally, within the RX segment, there are 2 macro themes to consider. First, from a pricing perspective, we saw signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, and as I sit here today, we expect 2019 price headwinds in our core products to be consistent with our 2018 year-over-year fourth quarter results. 
And second, expect that we will continue to invest in our pipeline with [ $1 ] growth in R&D investments versus 2018. 
At our Investor Day, we plan to provide more details around each of these trends as we provide 2019 guidance at that time. 
As you complete your models, another important factor to keep in mind is our continued strong operating cash flow profile. 
In 2018, our adjusted operating cash flow conversion to adjusted net income once again exceeded 100%. 
Our teams continue to remain confident in our cash flow generation, we go factor into our framework around capital allocation that will also be outlined at the May 9 Investor Day. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

So question number 1, can you give us some concrete examples in terms of things that you can do to drive the growth higher? Is this going to be largely a bolt-on strategy or there's things you can do with the core business? And then the second question is, are we going to get an RX announcement on May 9? And is there a scenario where you guys step back and say, hey, the math or the demand for this asset isn't their, we're going to separate on the platform but maybe we'll hold onto it for some period longer until things look different?"

I mean I'm ever going to sit here and make an ultimatum and say nothing could adjust our plans, but I don't see it right now. When you talk about the consumer side of the business, that will be a major, major, major portion of May 9. But If I had to give you an example, by the way my answer is it can come from bolt-ons, it can come from innovation on core business, it can come from share building, it all relates to the consumer understanding of how people buy our products and what are relative shares are in different categories. So let's see nicotine cessation as an example. That's a category where we're the market leader by far, much bigger than the national brand. If you're in that position, that means you need to be the one that's doing a lot of innovation and you may look at that and say, well in order to do that you have to go through FDA long flow processes. In that particular category, that's not true. There's nothing that stops us from innovating on forms, packaging, flavors and the like to draw business and grow that category, segment itself. As I sit here, coming from the industry I came in, we and the company at Perrigo think we've done a good job but it's tiny compared to what's going on in the world of let's give an example of how explosive vapor products have been to switch consumers from smoking to vapor. So the total tobacco industry starts at $100 billion, and we're a tiny fraction of that. So to me, just treading order the way we are isn't good enough and innovation needs to ramp up with new forms and new ways to satisfy some smokers, pretty much all of whom want to quit. So that would be an example of an area we would push for an innovation and I pick that one because we've already gone to market with a couple of SKUs this year that are not offered by the national brands."

If you look a few years ago, and again, we'll show you all of this, we were getting bigger hits for our new product development program and higher productivity than we're getting today.

So first of all you asked about headwinds and quantifying those at EPS level, I try to give you some good numbers within my commentary, only break it down for you, so first of all, CHC Americas, let's focus on that segment. So we talked about gross margin effects, there is 2 items, forget mix but that have been slow but the 2 items I highlighted pretty detailed was one the Ohio issue, the facility issue. We talked about [ $13 ] million impact in Q4. I also mentioned in my comments production starts in March. So what we will have you some overtimes I'm not only with normal apartment you're going to have some override the facility down for 2 months, he could back into production, recognize the sales, have overhanging the first of the year that converts into production and sales in the first half of 2019. The other 1 is I think that the qualifying and that is around service and production variances. a given number of [ $16 ] million. that's a pretty firm number. In other words we have to work through in Q1 and Q2 of 2019 as we've experienced those and if you look at the accounting part goes to a ministry to terms with sales but he could expect margin and CHC Americas to be in the zone that you thank you for working its way to that 20% level as we exit the year. So you can be pretty open about their pickers will take some time for the service the numbers to manifest themselves and benefit the panel as we resolve the issues and sell the product that you only produce. You asked about R&D and a general context we look at R&D and ultimately,, but Arthur was a good one, but uncertainty is a percent of sales are limited to the consumer businesses, worker productivity. on the boards a flick of the percent of sales, Murphy little bit as a percent of sales and consumer, the focus of our we get better value, marginal value are arranged over, our go for which is really key focus of a team. We have some percent of sales increase that phone be material. I guess I like in RX R&D will be a portable basis, guardian or was it was a double take on 18, we are expecting the pipeline to continue investing in the popular election as well.

So when they go through a very traditional, there more for traditional consumer company then we are here in U.S, which is more for storebrand business. So that means everything from the quantification of the idea to what they're going to do any kind of advertising, the tabbed advertising and various research services, they have action standards that each of those that advertising have to hit, they have action standards or product testing, the plastic texting once it goes into the market, the visuals and their just in the look at the returns they're getting and if the returns and market data generating the kind of returns and metrics that pay out that advertising, then they shifted elsewhere to somewhere there tells. They have a priority list of problem, this is a very big portfolio of brands and they have split the way they look at the business and their core growth trend, the regular plans, which really talked about and they sustain plans. And they are, again, we walked all of that, but to put the most investment and the ones that meet the criteria to get into that growth category. So and markets that may go down and look at profitability by that and on the metrics that you would expect. I'm not sure how to answer the consumer company. We look at quarter performance, want to get to be a top quarter performer, that means we are going to measure and target revenue growth, EPS growth, margins, leverage, on the typical balance sheet metrics that you would look at and that's what we will be working against over the next couple of years. And then a freak at the multiples that those consumer companies earn, which is part of the idea here."

My early observations of what the key issues facing Perrigo are, and what we need to do to fix the business remain largely unchange",1742,"Good afternoon, everyone. 
I have one quarter under my belt and I'm learning more and more about the business every day. 
My early observations of what the key issues facing Perrigo are, and what we need to do to fix the business remain largely unchanged, and can be summarized as follows: first, the challenges that we face are fixable. The more time I've spent with the business, the more I've become comfortable that we can not only take Perrigo back to its prior strength, but that we can build on the platform to be even stronger. 
Second, new product volume and core brand innovation over the last few years has not been sufficient to offset increased price competition in the USA. 
Third, increased organizational complexity and lack of sufficient investment in capacity and technology has reduced the company's service levels and competitive advantage in an area that has historically been a core competency for Perrigo and, which inside the company we rightly call the Perrigo Advantage. 
Fourth, overhangs of which the recent EUR 1.6 billion Irish notice of assessment is the most meaningful and, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes are a distraction and a resource strain. 
Fifth, over the last few years, Perrigo has not made the type of investments that had driven the company's success for so many years. That is a robust pipeline of new products and smaller bolt-on acquisitions. 
Sixth, our international consumer business is a good business with attractive upside potential, but has a legacy of having been managed as an amalgamation of many small businesses. 
Great progress has been made restructuring that business and reducing complexity, but there is much more to be done in order to enhance performance and margins. 
Overall, I like the business and it is performing better than most investors realize. 
Seventh, our generic RX business has diversified in highly differentiated pharmaceutical business, but when RX is combined with our consumer businesses, both become neglected. 
I continue to support the board's decision to separate the companies so they both can reach their full potential. 
Eighth, there is great talent within the company that was waiting to be unleashed and that is being done. There are also some important capability and skill gaps that needed  be addressed in the area of consumer marketing, R&D, innovation and business intelligence. Those voids have been filled with great talent both externally and internally. 
And ninth, the company's recent earnings guidance revisions have frustrated investors. While the fourth quarter results were relatively lackluster and negatively impacted by continued executional issues, we delivered exactly what we said we would, despite some pretty significant headwinds, so that's a start. 
Again, all of these issues are fixable and many are being addressed now with specific actions throughout our company. 
Most importantly, we have developed a new strategic plan, designed to help us deliver our new vision, which is to make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
The plan has been approved by our board, and we are now onto the implementation stage. We will share the full plan at our Investor Day, which has been scheduled for May 9 at the New York Stock Exchange. 
At that meeting, we will review how we are transforming Perrigo from a healthcare to a consumer self-care company to take advantage of a massive global consumer trend. 
We intend to provide detailed plans and actions we have already taken in the areas of portfolio reconfiguration, investments in capacity and technology, innovation initiatives, cost savings plans to help fuel growth, capital allocation plans and organizational effectiveness initiatives, including several key external hires. 
We will also provide calendar year 2019 guidance at that time. 
Turning to the fourth quarter of 2018, let me give you an overview of how I saw consolidated and segment commercial results. 
Reported fourth quarter net sales for the company were $1.2 billion, down 5% versus a year ago on an organic constant-currency basis and adjusted to diluted EPS was $0.97 as we guided, which was down 24% versus year ago. 
We experienced operating income declines across all 3 of our segments for different reasons, which I'll detail in a minute, but at the 30,000-foot level, the consumer businesses in the Americas were negatively affected by cost and customer service. 
In our international segment, we purposefully invested in advertising and in R&D, and in RX, we continued to suffer from downward pricing pressure, albeit at a lower rate than we had been previously experiencing. 
In the consumer market segment. Consumer offtake and storebrand market share continued to grow. Underlying revenue trends on our core businesses were relatively unchanged. 
Importantly, sales volumes on the base over-the-counter healthcare lines were once again solid, except for animal health, which you are aware of and has been discussed on previous calls. 
Execution in the fourth quarter remained sloppy, which depressed revenues and reduced margins. 
On top of challenged service levels, a significant equipment startup issue in the infant nutrition business resulted in a missed sales opportunity of $10 million with a onetime impact to gross profit of approximately $0.08 of adjusted EPS per share. 
Turning to consumer international. We continued to simplify and upgrade our offerings during 2018 and the fourth quarter. This purposeful pruning of our product lines, which has translated to higher margins mask sell our business is really performing. 
And our core international OTC brands representing 70% of consumer internationals net sales grew approximately 2.5% for the year and 1.5% for the fourth quarter, holding market share in the European OTC market that grew at roughly the same rate. 
We are especially pleased with momentum we are observing in the dermatological space with our ACO brand and cough, cold, and analgesics with our Solpadeine brand. 
Fourth quarter advertising and R&D was increased by $13 million or 28% on a constant-currency basis versus last year to keep the momentum going. 
And with the bulk of the product line pruning that has occurred over the last few years behind us, we anticipate top line growth in 2019 for our total international consumer segment. 
I'd also note customer service levels have averaged around 95% for the last year, a testament to this team's focus on keeping our winning brands on the shelves and available to consumers. 
Moving on to RX. It was a better quarter as we started to see the benefits of a solid pipeline of new products begin to positively impact the business in both revenue and margins. 
We saw margin improvement in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, benefiting from the launch of Testosterone 1.62% and an easing of downward pricing pressure. 
Revenues continued to decline year-over-year by approximately 15%, which is half the rate that we experienced in the third quarter. 
We expect this business segment to improve as its new product pipeline continues to come to market. 
For perspective, we have 10 tentative approvals awaiting final action and 65 new product projects under development or under FDA review. 
Also worth noting, customer service levels have been restored to greater than 90% and as it relates to the separation process, I won't comment on where we are right now on the sell or spin or in the Q&A other than to say it is on track and we remain committed to the strategic initiative. 
So, in summary, 2018 was a challenging year, but overall, our consumer businesses market shares were stable in growing markets. 
Executional issues are being addressed. We have restored customer service levels in the RX segment and we received the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. 
We have an exciting strategic plan that we believe will transform Perrigo back into a growing company with a bright future as we evolve from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. 
We note that 2019 will be a transformational year that implements the many major changes I have discussed and, which we recognize makes it difficult right now, to forecast our business. It is our intention to bring significant clarity to the strategy and transformation execution as well as provide full year 2019 guidance on May 9. 
One last topic I'd like to cover before I turn the call over to Ron. 2 days ago, Perrigo filed a petition within the Irish High Court because we strongly believe Irish revenues notice of assessment was issued in breach of the company's legitimate expectations regarding how it would be treated as a taxpayer. 
As we noted in our prior disclosure related to the Irish tax assessment, we strongly disagree with the assessment and believe that it is without merit and incorrect as a matter of law. 
We also said that the company would pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues that may be necessary or appropriate to challenge this assessment. 
We owe it to our shareholders to take every legitimate step to challenge this assessment and that is why we pursued this action in the Irish court. 
I will not go into the details of this filing other than to say this: First, we believe that Irish revenues assessment conflicts with revenues long-standing tax treatment of Elan Pharma, which was carrying on a trade of international property for over 20 years. 
As noted in the judicial review proceedings, we believe that Irish revenue breached Elan Pharma's legitimate expectation, based on that tax history, when it wrongly recharacterized Elan Pharma's trade some 20 years later in the amended assessment. 
And second, the judicial review proceeding is a separate process that must be pursued in the Irish courts rather than before the Tax Appeals Commission. 
The appeal before the Tax Appeals Commission has been stayed until the court makes a decision in this judicial review proceeding. 
If the court finds that Elan Pharma's legitimate expectation was breached, the court would set aside the entire assessment. 
To be clear, this is a challenge of the process, not the assessment itself. 
If the court does not agree with our assertion, then we will proceed to challenge the tax assessment on its merit in the Tax Appeals Commission. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Ron Winowiecki, to cover more specific financial results for the fourth quarter and year. 
And while I said that we will not provide full 2019 guidance until our Investor Day meeting, he will give you some rough planning input as you think about your models. Ron?"
319092,602262835,1672133,"Perrigo Company plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2019",2019-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Perrigo Company plc","Executives","Thank you, Murray, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, with reported net income",1697,"Thank you, Murray, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I will now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. 
On a consolidated basis, reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, with reported net income of $82 million and reported EPS of $0.60 per share. 
A few adjustments to the GAAP P&L this quarter are worth noting. First, we recognized $170 million gain in our P&L resulting from the achievements and receipt of the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. 
As a reminder, we have the potential for another milestone receipt of $400 million in the event 2020 Tysabri sales exceed $1.95 billion. 
In addition, as we continue on our plan of separating the RX business, we expensed $7.3 million, which included a combination of technical  accounting, tax work streams and operational actions to segregate the business. 
GAAP tax expense as a percentage of pretax income was 60% in the quarter, compared to a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%. The difference was due primarily to the tax effect of the non-GAAP pretax adjustments and the effective valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and liabilities consistent with the adjusted pretax income. 
Now turning to Slide 10. On a consolidated net sales, we're approximately $1.2 billion, 7% lower than the prior year. 
Unfavorable foreign currency translation impacted net sales by approximately $18 million in the quarter. 
On an organic constant-currency basis, net sales decreased by approximately 5% due to the following: One, RX net sales were down approximately 15% as price erosion and lower volumes impacted the business. RX next sales were slightly above our expectations as we saw year-over-year pricing trends improve in the fourth quarter in our core generic portfolio. 
As we have discussed previously, our inability to supply certain products has resulted in lower volumes. However, it is worth noting the team has been focusing on correcting these issues and service levels have improved from the low to mid-80% range in mid 2018 to approximately 90% as we sit here today. 
New product sales of $22 million partially offset these declines. 2, net sales in the U.S. animal health business were approximately 50% lower than the prior year. Due to the previously disclosed loss of a partner product and Channel Dynamics. 
In the fourth quarter, excluding the animal health business, on an organic constant-currency basis, our worldwide consumer businesses were approximately 1% lower year-over-year. 
And 3, we experienced a temporary disruption caused by an equipment start up issue at one of our infant formula facilities and as Murray stated, this disruption caused net sales in the quarter to be lower by approximately $10 million. 
I will discuss the startup issue in more detail shortly. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Adjusted gross profit was approximately $490 million or $75 million lower than the prior year. 
CHC Americas adjusted gross profit was more than half of the decline, down approximately $44 million compared to the prior year due to the following factors: first, lower net sales and unfavorable product mix accounted for approximately $15 million of this variance. 
Second, our infant formula plan Ohio had undergone a series of major equipment updates as part of our ongoing investment in capacity to support growth in this business. 
When restarting production in this facility, during the fourth quarter, our quality system identified equipment variations inconsistent with our quality control standards. 
Accordingly, inclusive of scrap product and lost sales, gross profit was impacted by approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
We anticipate production to resume early next month. 
Finally, as reported in the third quarter, the CHC Americas business continued to experience lower customer service levels, which led to production inefficiencies and operating variances. These factors, combined with higher year-over-year input cost, impacted gross profit by approximately $16 million. 
CHC International adjusted gross profit was unfavorably impacted by approximately $9 million in the fourth quarter due to currency translation movements. 
In the RX segment, while adjusted gross profit was down in the quarter due to lower net sales, adjusted gross margin was approximately 55%, an increase of 160 basis points, compared to the prior year, driven by the launch of higher-margin new products. 
Slide 12 outlines the primary operating expense drivers in our businesses. In the fourth quarter, we increased growth investments compared to the prior year on a constant-currency basis. 
In our consumer platforms, we prioritized investments to drive long range growth. Specifically, in the consumer international business, plain investments and advertising and R&D were approximately 16.1% as a percentage to net sales, compared to 12.5% in the prior year. 
Likewise, RX R&D investments were approximately 8% to net sales as we continued to invest in our strong pipeline. 
Selling and administration expenses benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, movements of approximately $6 million, lower compensation accruals in the quarter and continuing improvement actions in the cost structure of our consumer international segment. 
Turning to Slide 13. The major financial drivers I just reviewed resulted in consolidated adjusted operating income of $195 million, compared to $253 million in the prior year and a reduction in margins. 
A bit of perspective on margins. Our overall consolidated operating margin for the quarter was 16.3%, down approximately 350 basis points compared to the prior year, due primarily to: 1, production issues in CHC Americas, negatively impacted that segments adjusted operating margin by 400 basis points, and consolidated Perrigo adjusted margin by 225 basis points; and 2, in CHC International, the intentional investments to drive long-term growth in this business impacted the segments adjusted operating margin by 350 basis points and consolidated Perrigo adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points. 
These are partially offset by RX where our adjusted operating margin increased year-over-year from 38.1% to 39.2% as we continue to invest in R&D. 
Slide 14 illustrates the overall consolidated adjusted operating results for the fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was consistent with our expectations at approximately 20%. 
Overall, adjusted earnings per share was $0.97, right in the middle of the revised guidance range we provided last call and despite the negative impact of approximately $0.80 per share from the Ohio facility equipment production issue. 
Turning now to Slide 15. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remained strong. Cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 147% for the quarter, which highlights the powerful cash flow generation of our business model. 
Of note, the December 31, 2018 balance sheet does not include the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment we received in the first quarter of 2019. 
Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our long-standing commitment to an investment grade financial policy. 
As Murray highlighted, we are looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will outline our strategic plan and our 2019 guidance framework. 
In the interim, we're highlighting a few key business trends headed into 2019. 
Our consumer businesses continued to grow, led by Store Brand penetration and a healthy new product pipeline in our consumer international business. 
And as a reminder, the loss of the partner product in our animal health business will anniversary midyear and will no longer affect year-over-year comparisons, starting in Q3 of 2019. 
Also given the current weakness of certain currencies to the U.S. dollar, translation exposure expected to negatively impact 2019 growth in our consumer businesses by approximately 190 basis points as we stand here today. 
From an operating perspective, in our consumer businesses, there are 2 core macro themes headed into 2019. First, as our service levels in RX and CHC International business are operating above 90%, our top priority is the resolution of the operating variances and customer service dynamics in the Consumer Americas segment. 
Actions to improve service in this segment are underway and include one, adding capacity in our capability value stream; and 2, important process, technology and structural improvements to drive and sustain operational performance. 
As previously indicated, we are now refocused on regaining the Perrigo Advantage with customer service as a key pillar. 
This is a top priority while we are making progress. It will take time for these actions to be realized in our financial statements. 
As previously inventoried operating variances, royalty or income statement, in 2019, as the inventory sold in the first half of the year. This means the weakness we saw in the second half of 2018 will depress 2019's first half results in the form of higher cost to product sold. 
Second, we have already begun our strategic investments in various aspects of our consumer businesses as evidenced by the planned increase in advertising within the consumer international segment in the fourth quarter, along with build out of capabilities in R&D, innovation and business intelligence, which will all sort of impact first half results. 
We will show specific actions to help offset these investments at our Investor Day, but they will come later in the year in the form of cost reduction programs. 
Given this operating framework, consumer adjusted operating margins are expected to be lower in the first half of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, improving as we march through the year. 
Finally, within the RX segment, there are 2 macro themes to consider. First, from a pricing perspective, we saw signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, and as I sit here today, we expect 2019 price headwinds in our core products to be consistent with our 2018 year-over-year fourth quarter results. 
And second, expect that we will continue to invest in our pipeline with dollar growth in R&D investments versus 2018. 
At our Investor Day, we plan to provide more details around each of these trends as we provide 2019 guidance at that time. 
As you complete your models, another important factor to keep in mind is our continued strong operating cash flow profile. 
In 2018, our adjusted operating cash flow conversion to adjusted net income once again exceeded 100%. 
Our teams continue to remain confident in our cash flow generation, which will factor into our framework around capital allocation that will also be outlined at the May 9 Investor Day. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

So we obviously believe we're going to be, as Ron said, starting the year a little bit slower because of cost. But then as we start to bring a number of these initiatives, which we will give you real-life example of, there's no way for you to be forecasting them in your trends. So I hate to say it, but you're going to have to wait to see the plan in May 9. So I try to give you a little bit of a new piece of information that I haven't seen people talking about much, which is that we understand there is dilution from the separation, we understand that there are investments and that -- so that's why you heard us talking about there will be a cost component to this initiative as well, which again is difficult for you to model.

The second one is just as I wrap my hands around with this pending tax liability, I know you got a very strong -- I knew you have a very strong view of this, this is something you will prevail ultimately, but how does that pending liability impact your capital deployment priorities and how you think about putting capital to work as you look to reposition the consumer business while you're waiting for some of the organic kind of initiatives to take hold?"

I think in 2018 alone, there were $55 million of purposely discontinued products. That's the right number, right, Ron? So you have to look at that growth within the context of what they've been doing consolidating markets. They've discontinued thousands of SKUs that were nonprofitable and that's how you're seeing the margin enhancement along with significant organizational changes. They're most of the way through, so you should start seeing the top line growth that's underlying on the core business to show itself in, in 2019 and I think there are plenty of opportunities and they have a very robust new product pipeline they've been working at. Having said all that, international, it has plenty of opportunities, it's not the issue facing the company and it's not in my mind what unlocks significant value for our investors. Right now, getting the Americas business right, getting service levels, getting that new product engine going again, revisiting and when it makes sense, bolt-on acquisitions and doing all the things that made Perrigo great before it shorted focus, being distracted internationally and with a number of other things we did, is the top priority for this company to create value.

And I've had to deal with that for over a decade in the previous industry I was in, but it does not get in the way of doing what we want to do. And what I think you will think about our capital structure, our balance sheet, everything, you should be thinking that we have our eyes clearly set on being a top-performing CPG consumer-based company with our evolution from healthcare to self-care.

Is this going to be largely a bolt-on strategy or there's things that you can do with the core business? And then the second question is, are we going to get an RX announcement on May 9?

I mean, I'm never ever going to sit here and make an ultimatum and say nothing could adjust our plans, but I don't see it right now. When you talk about the consumer side of the business, that will be a major, major, major portion of May 9. But if I had to give you an example, and by the way, my answer is it can come from bolt-ons, it can come from innovation on core business, it can come from share building, and it all relates to the consumer understanding of how people buy our products and what our relative shares are in different categories. So let's use nicotine cessation as an example. That's a category where we're the market leader by far, much bigger than the national brand. If you're in that position, that means you need to be the one that's doing a lot of innovation and you may look at that and say, well in order to do that, you have to go through FDA, long slow processes. In that particular category, that's not true. There's nothing that stops us from innovating on forms, packaging, flavors and the like to draw business and grow that category -- segment itself. As I sit here, coming from the industry I came in, we in the company at Perrigo think we've done a good job, but it's tiny compared to what's going on in the world of, let's give an example of how explosive vapor products have been to switch consumers from smoking to vapor. So the total tobacco industry starts at $100 billion, and we're a tiny fraction of that. So to me, just sort of treading water the way we are isn't good enough and innovation needs to ramp up with new forms and new ways to satisfy smokers, pretty much all of whom want to quit. So that would be an example of an area we would push for innovation. And I pick that one because we've already gone to market with a couple of SKUs this year that are not offered by the national brands."

There are some investments that are related to some new products that we'll spell those kinds of things out, but some of them are on longer-term plans, et cetera. I said on the last conference call that we had about the right level of R&D in total and about the right level of advertising on, in general on our core businesses in total. My concern on the R&D business right now, is not that there isn't sufficient money -- sufficient money, it's the productivity of the initiatives. If you look a few years ago, and again, we'll show you all of this, we were getting bigger hits for our new product development program and higher productivity than we're getting today. They're working on just as many approvals, but we strategically have to identify the right and bigger ideas. And that's why I brought in Jim Dillard and consolidated R&D in the last month, who is a pro, who I -- and you'll love him when you meet him.

So first of all, you asked about headwinds and quantifying those at the EPS level. I tried to give you some good numbers within my commentary, and let me kind of break it down for you. So first of all, CHC Americas, let's focus on that segment. So we talked about gross margin effects, there was 2 items -- forget mix, because that ebbs and flows -- but the 2 items I highlighted pretty detailed was one, the Ohio issue, the facility issue. We talked about a $13 million impact in Q4. I also mentioned in my comments production starts in March. So what will happen, you have some overhang there. I'm not going to give you the dollar amount, but you're going to have some overhang, as that facility was down for 2 months, you get it back into production, you recognize the sales. So you're going to have some overhang in the first half of the year that converts into production and sales in the first half of 2019. The other one is, I think, rather quantified, and that was the one around service and production variances. I gave you a number of $16 million, that's a pretty firm number. In other words, that's what we have to work through now in Q1 and Q2 of 2019, as we've experienced those, we've -- if you look at the accounting, part of it goes to your balance sheet, in terms with sales, but you could expect margin at CHC Americas to be in the zone that you saw in Q4, working its way back up to that 20% level as we exit the year. So we've been pretty open about that. It's going to take some time for those service -- service dynamics to kind of manifest themselves and benefit the P&L as we resolve the issues and sell the product that we've already produced. You asked about R&D and the general context we look at R&D, and I'll reiterate Murray's comment, which I thought was a good one, we don't see R&D as a percent of sales changing materially in the consumer businesses. We look at productivity. In other words, if you look at the percent of sales, you may see a little bit of a change as a percent of sales in consumer. The real focus will be how do we get better value, margin value, per R&D dollar on a go-forward basis, is really the key focus of the team. So you'd have some percent of sales increase, but it won't be material. I did highlight in RX, R&D in RX will be up on a dollar basis. I didn't guide you on a percentage, but assume you take RX dollars in 2018, we are expecting, with our strong pipeline, to continue investing in that pipeline next year as well. So let me -- that carries forward some color, I should comment on CHC International, play off, Chris Schott, your earlier question. Listen, we're confident in high-teens margins in this business. I just want to make sure we're very clear, CHC International, we are pointed at those high-teens. Now we've been messaging for some time we are reinvesting back in the business. Now we don't think we're going to go backwards at OI, OI margins, but you could see us pause. You could see us flatten out for the year as we reinvestment in the business, we invest in advertising and promotion next year and the like. But we're still confident in the next couple of years, we are pointed at that high-teen adjusted operating margin percent. So hopefully, that gives you, Ami, the answers to your questions on a go-forward look. On the tax side, I'll defer it, if it's fair, back to Murray on that."

As it relates to the timing of the judicial challenge, it's -- this whole process has been a surprise so far, but if it wasn't, it wouldn't surprise us if that first round took around a year. It could be longer, it could be shorter, if it went through kind of a normal process, which we'll find out if it does. So -- and then, depending on how it goes, either side would have the ability to appeal that. And then, if all of that didn't come out in our favor, and we hope that it does, then it starts over again in the tax appellate process. So it's going to be a while."

Is it just that you're not able to book sales and there's a risk of losing the business to another supplier? Or do you actually have some sort of performance penalties like you have on the RX side? And just a couple of follow-up questions here on the RX business. Ron, you mentioned that price erosion in 2019 probably would be similar to 4Q. What was the rate in 4Q and could you give us a little bit of insight into some of the key expected launches or relaunches in '19, including albuterol, HFA and maybe more importantly, scopolamine?"

As it relates to the effect of service on customers, the big customer service issue, which it was a onetime startup that has a meaningful effect, you lose revenues, but we're fortunate that there's not a lot of competition in that particular business. On the ongoing service issues, of course it affects you. Part of your ability to withstand pricing pressure and everything else is your ability to both innovate and service at a higher level than anybody else. So when you don't, it creates more competition. That has to be this company or this division's top priority to fix that and it is. So I mean, you felt that and you see that in -- that the businesses were pressured somewhat to that. So all of these plans are designed to fix that, but in general, the business, despite that, has held up pretty well, still growing when you exclude Animal Health."

And in my comments, I commented we are putting capital into our Teva value stream. I mean, we have one high-class problem here, and that is volumes are up. We've just have not caught up with the volume spike and servicing our customers. So you will see some cash from a capital standpoint come in over the next 6 to 12 months as well. If we come back, you asked about RX, let me give you some details that you asked for here. So you asked about pricing, [ we did not call ] pricing, just assume those are in the high single digits on our core products. We talk about Q3 was above that, right, north of 10. So again, we saw some stability. I'd like to say no erosion, but we're still seeing erosion, at a more stabilized level. You asked about launches going into next year. Listen, right now, you saw one come out, acyclovir, with an announcement we made most recently, it's a nice, I'll call it, a double, single double, that you'll see in our portfolio launch next year. ProAir, we're still optimistic. When you take a look at that product, we're working very closely with the FDA. We're committed to bringing a very important product to the marketplace and we're still optimistic to launch that product in the, I'll call it, for very near future.

We have products, 40% of our volume internationally is branded products that -- a number of those are in self-care categories that present opportunities here in the United States, as an example, and the company has a good track record of expanding. So it's a two-part answer, because the first part was some of the expansions we've done have been in the areas where there are good barriers to it, like infant nutrition or in nicotine cessation. Although, one could argue other companies could get into that, but we've done it so well with our overall store-brand model, which is hard to match up against. So there are plenty of opportunities for growth and companies do that all the time. And we will show you how we've done it in the past, how we'll do it in the future, at various levels, from incremental opportunities that help just keep the brands fresh and make it harder for competitors to sort of know where we're going next, all the way to bigger incremental opportunities, to potential bolt-ons that have the kind of barriers that you're talking about. So we'll give you -- I'll tell you, one of the biggest changes I've had from my old job to this new job is just how many opportunities there are, and it's sorting through, finding and making sure we're investing in the right ones. But there's no shortage of opportunities for growth. It's just doing it the right way and getting to the market with them. Refresh my memory on the first question?"

So when they go through a very traditional -- they're more of a traditional consumer company than we are here in the U.S., which is more of a store-brand business. So that means everything from the quantification of the idea to when they're going to do any kind of advertising, they test the advertising in various research services. They have action standards that each of those -- that advertising has to hit. They have action standards on product testing, the product has to it. Once it goes into the market, they measure those and they adjust and they look at the returns they're getting. And if the returns in market aren't generating the kind of returns and metrics that pay out that advertising, then they shift it elsewhere to somewhere that does. They have a priority list of probable -- this is a very big portfolio of brands and they have split the way they look at the business into sort of: their core growth brands; their exit brands, which we've already talked about; and their sustained brands. And they are, and again, we'll walk through all of that, but they put the most investment in the ones that meet the criteria to get into that growth category. So -- and markets, they go down and they look at profitability by SKU and all the metrics that you would expect. I'm not sure how to answer the consumer company. We will look at top quartile performance. We want to get to be a top quartile performer. That means we are going to measure and target revenue growth, EPS growth, margins, leverage, all the typical balance sheet metrics that you would look at, and that's what we will be working against over the next couple of years. And then hopefully get the multiples that those consumer companies earn, which is part of the idea here."

So obviously, best case is you don't have to pay any money, although you don't know the timing. But in terms of the worst-case, if in fact you, it's determined, however remote the possibility, that you do have to pay, an Irish tax expert told us there would be an 8% annual interest charge. And I think it was 5 years ago that the transition happened. And then there would be a penalty on top of that, anywhere from 3% to 100%, with 3% being what they call a general penalty, and 100% where there's deliberate, willful behavior. So is the calculation of worst-case somewhere between, no matter how remote it could be, $2.3 million and $3.9 million? Does that make sense? Second question, sorry, billion dollars. Second question is on tuck-in. I think, Murray, you said you want to get back to what made the company great, i.e., tuck-ins. How does the outlook appear? Are you close on anything? Are you looking mostly domestically or internationally, private, public? And how are valuations shaping up right now? And then thirdly, just to clarify on the input cost you discussed, is this related to what a lot of companies are seeing now with rising input cost?

I mean, it makes no sense and I -- this company, if you look at -- read the challenge. To sit there and have a discussion of willful fraud or something like that is silly. But beyond that, we believe we win on the merits. We believe that when you look at the actual legitimate expectations that Elan pharma had, based on 20 years of trading history, that this is unjust, and we will see how it plays out. But we have good advisers, a good team working on this and you're going to have to watch it. What you need to hear from me is, answering the question that was very early on the call here, which is that this will not get in our way of our ability to go forward and do the strategic initiatives that we need to get Perrigo growing. And this will play out over the course of years and we will keep you informed. But I'm quite confident and have built a lot of value, whether it was at UST, which had a massive, and antitrust overhang on it; or on Lorillard that had massive regulatory challenges that were going on, on that business. So the key in my experience with those is we fight them very aggressively and fight on the behalf of our shareholders, especially when you believe you're right, and we do believe we're right. And then make sure that you're building the business. So top priority, top focus, is building the business. That's what's going to create value here. On the tuck-ins, I mean, my answer is almost like yes. It's, are we looking at all kinds of things and going through a funnel here and all that? We will put a -- we will scrutinize and make sure that we are making good investments, but there are many opportunities and we'll bring clarity to that on May 9.

These are industry issues, what makes sense from a partner perspective. I would say that probably, the biggest disappointment from my chair, traditionally, we are very, very good at offsetting input costs with productivity. And because some of the supply chain issues we've had in customer service and some of that complexity, we haven't been able to do that. So in my mind, that's the reason I look at these as short term. When we can get the supply chain back to the Perrigo Advantage and we can continue the productivity curve that we've been very successful at historically, we can offset these input costs in a productive way.

I have one quarter under my belt and I'm learning more and more about the business every day. 
My early observations of what the key issues facing Perrigo are, and what we need to do to fix the business, remain largely unchanged, and can be summarized as follows: first, the challenges that we face are fixable. The more time I've spent with the business, the more I've become comfortable that we can not only take Perrigo back to its prior strength, but that we can build on the platform to be even stronger. 
Second, new product volume and core brand innovation over the last few years has not been sufficient to offset increased price competition in the USA. 
Third, increased organizational complexity and lack of sufficient investment in capacity and technology has reduced the company's service levels and competitive advantage in an area that has historically been a core competency for Perrigo and which, inside the company, we rightly call the Perrigo Advantage. 
Fourth, overhangs of which the recent EUR 1.6 billion Irish notice of assessment is the most meaningful and which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes are a distraction and a resource drain. 
Fifth, over the last few years, Perrigo has not made the type of investments that had driven the company's success for so many years. That is a robust pipeline of new products and smaller bolt-on acquisitions. 
Sixth, our international consumer business is a good business with attractive upside potential, but has a legacy of having been managed as an amalgamation of many small businesses. 
Great progress has been made restructuring that business and reducing complexity, but there is much more to be done in order to enhance performance and margins. 
Overall, I like the business and it is performing better than most investors realize. 
Seventh, our generic RX business has diversified in highly differentiated pharmaceutical business, but when RX is combined with our consumer businesses, both become neglected. 
I continue to support the board's decision to separate the companies so they both can reach their full potential. 
Eighth, there is great talent within the company that was waiting to be unleashed and that is being done. There are also some important capability and skill gaps that needed to be addressed in the area of consumer marketing, R&D, innovation and business intelligence. Those voids have been filled with great talent both externally and internally. 
And ninth, the company's recent earnings guidance revisions have frustrated investors. While the fourth quarter results were relatively lackluster and negatively impacted by continued executional issues, we delivered exactly what we said we would, despite some pretty significant headwinds, so that's a start. 
Again, all of these issues are fixable and many are being addressed now with specific actions throughout our company. 
Most importantly, we have developed a new strategic plan, designed to help us deliver our new vision, which is to make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
The plan has been approved by our board, and we are now onto the implementation stage. We will share the full plan at our Investor Day, which has been scheduled for May 9 at the New York Stock Exchange. 
At that meeting, we will review how we are transforming Perrigo from a healthcare to a consumer self-care company to take advantage of a massive global consumer trend. 
We intend to provide detailed plans and actions we have already taken in the areas of portfolio reconfiguration, investments in capacity and technology, innovation initiatives, cost savings plans to help fuel growth, capital allocation plans and organizational effectiveness initiatives, including several key external hires. 
We will also provide calendar year 2019 guidance at that time. 
Turning to the fourth quarter of 2018, let me give you an overview of how I saw consolidated and segment commercial results. 
Reported fourth quarter net sales for the company were $1.2 billion, down 5% versus 1 year ago on an organic constant-currency basis and adjusted to diluted EPS was $0.97 as we guided, which was down 24% versus 1 year ago. 
We experienced operating income declines across all 3 of our segments for different reasons, which I'll detail in a minute, but at the 30,000-foot level, the consumer businesses in the Americas were negatively affected by cost and customer service. 
In our international segment, we purposefully invested in advertising and in R&D, and in RX, we continued to suffer from downward pricing pressure, albeit at a lower rate than we had been previously experiencing. 
In the consumer market segment. Consumer offtake and store brand market share continued to grow. Underlying revenue trends on our core businesses were relatively unchanged. 
Importantly, sales volumes on the base over-the-counter healthcare lines were once again solid, except for animal health, which you are aware of and has been discussed on previous calls. 
Execution in the fourth quarter remained sloppy, which depressed revenues and reduced margins. 
On top of challenged service levels, a significant equipment startup issue in the infant nutrition business resulted in a missed sales opportunity of $10 million with a onetime impact to gross profit of approximately $0.08 of adjusted EPS per share. 
Turning to consumer international. We continued to simplify and upgrade our offerings during 2018 and the fourth quarter. This purposeful pruning of our product lines, which has translated to higher margins mask sell our business as really performing. 
And our core international OTC brands representing 70% of consumer internationals net sales grew approximately 2.5% for the year and 1.5% for the fourth quarter, holding market share in the European OTC market that grew at roughly the same rate. 
We are especially pleased with momentum we are observing in the dermatological space with our ACO brand and cough, cold, and analgesics with our Solpadeine brand. 
Fourth quarter advertising and R&D was increased by $13 million or 28% on a constant-currency basis versus last year to keep the momentum going. 
And with the bulk of the product line pruning that has occurred over the last few years behind us, we anticipate top line growth in 2019 for our total international consumer segment. 
I'd also note customer service levels have averaged around 95% for the last year, a testament to this team's focus on keeping our winning brands on the shelves and available to consumers. 
Moving on to RX. It was a better quarter as we started to see the benefits of a solid pipeline of new products begin to positively impact the business in both revenue and margins. 
We saw margin improvement in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, benefiting from the launch of Testosterone 1.62% and an easing of downward pricing pressure. 
Revenues continued to decline year-over-year by approximately 15%, which is half the rate that we experienced in the third quarter. 
We expect this business segment to improve as its new product pipeline continues to come to market. 
For perspective, we have 10 tentative approvals awaiting final action and 65 new product projects under development or under FDA review. 
Also worth noting, customer service levels have been restored to greater than 90% and as it relates to the separation process, I won't comment on where we are right now on the sale or spin or in the Q&A other than to say it is on track and we remain committed to the strategic initiative. 
So, in summary, 2018 was a challenging year, but overall, our consumer businesses market shares were stable in growing markets. 
Executional issues are being addressed. We have restored customer service levels in the RX segment and we received the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. 
We have an exciting strategic plan that we believe will transform Perrigo back into a growing company with a bright future as we evolve from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. 
We note that 2019 will be a transformational year that implements the many major changes I have discussed and which we recognize makes it difficult right now to forecast our business. It is our intention to bring significant clarity to the strategy and transformation execution as well as provide full year 2019 guidance on May 9. 
One last topic I'd like to cover before I turn the call over to Ron. 2 days ago, Perrigo filed a petition within the Irish High Court because we strongly believe Irish revenues notice of assessment was issued in breach of the company's legitimate expectations regarding how it would be treated as a taxpayer. 
As we noted in our prior disclosure related to the Irish tax assessment, we strongly disagree with the assessment and believe that it is without merit and incorrect as a matter of law. 
We also said that the company would pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues that may be necessary or appropriate to challenge this assessment. 
We owe it to our shareholders to take every legitimate step to challenge this assessment and that is why we pursued this action in the Irish court. 
I will not go into the details of this filing other than to say this: First, we believe that Irish revenues assessment conflicts with revenues long-standing tax treatment of Elan Pharma, which was carrying on a trade of intellectual property for over 20 years. 
As noted in the judicial review proceedings, we believe that Irish revenue breached Elan Pharma's legitimate expectation, based on that tax history, when it wrongly recharacterized Elan Pharma's trade some 20 years later in the amended assessment. 
And second, the judicial review proceeding is a separate process that must be pursued in the Irish courts rather than before the Tax Appeals Commission. 
The appeal before the Tax Appeals Commission has been stayed until the court makes a decision in this judicial review proceeding. 
If the court finds that Elan Pharma's legitimate expectation was breached, the court would set aside the entire assessment. 
To be clear, this is a challenge of the process, not the assessment itself. 
If the court does not agree with our assertion, then we will proceed to challenge the tax assessment on its merit in the Tax Appeals Commission. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Ron Winowiecki, to cover more specific financial results for the fourth quarter and year. 
And while I said that we will not provide full 2019 guidance until our Investor Day meeting, he will give you some rough planning input as you think about your models. Ron?"
319092,602262835,1674411,"Perrigo Company plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2019",2019-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Perrigo Company plc","Executives","Thank you, Murray, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, with reported net income",1698,"Thank you, Murray, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I will now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. 
On a consolidated basis, reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, with reported net income of $82 million and reported EPS of $0.60 per share. 
A few adjustments to the GAAP P&L this quarter are worth noting. First, we recognized $170 million gain in our P&L resulting from the achievements and receipt of the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. 
As a reminder, we have the potential for another milestone receipt of $400 million in the event 2020 Tysabri sales exceed $1.95 billion. 
In addition, as we continue on our plan of separating the RX business, we expensed $7.3 million, which included a combination of technical  accounting, tax work streams and operational actions to segregate the business. 
GAAP tax expense as a percentage of pretax income was 60% in the quarter, compared to a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%. The difference was due primarily to the tax effect of the non-GAAP pretax adjustments and the effective valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and liabilities consistent with the adjusted pretax income. 
Now turning to Slide 10. On a consolidated net sales, we're approximately $1.2 billion, 7% lower than the prior year. 
Unfavorable foreign currency translation impacted net sales by approximately $18 million in the quarter. 
On an organic constant-currency basis, net sales decreased by approximately 5% due to the following: One, RX net sales were down approximately 15% as price erosion and lower volumes impacted the business. RX next sales were slightly above our expectations as we saw year-over-year pricing trends improve in the fourth quarter in our core generic portfolio. 
As we have discussed previously, our inability to supply certain products has resulted in lower volumes. However, it is worth noting the team has been focusing on correcting these issues and service levels have improved from the low to mid-80% range in mid 2018 to approximately 90% as we sit here today. 
New product sales of $22 million partially offset these declines. 2, net sales in the U.S. animal health business were approximately 50% lower than the prior year due to the previously disclosed loss of a partner product and Channel Dynamics. 
In the fourth quarter, excluding the animal health business, on an organic constant-currency basis, our worldwide consumer businesses were approximately 1% lower year-over-year. 
And 3, we experienced a temporary disruption caused by an equipment start up issue at one of our infant formula facilities and, as Murray stated, this disruption caused net sales in the quarter to be lower by approximately $10 million. 
I will discuss the startup issue in more detail shortly. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Adjusted gross profit was approximately $490 million or $75 million lower than the prior year. 
CHC Americas adjusted gross profit was more than half of the decline, down approximately $44 million compared to the prior year due to the following factors: first, lower net sales and unfavorable product mix accounted for approximately $15 million of this variance. 
Second, our infant formula plan in Ohio had undergone a series of major equipment updates as part of our ongoing investment in capacity to support growth in this business. 
When restarting production in this facility, during the fourth quarter, our quality system identified equipment variations inconsistent with our quality control standards. 
Accordingly, inclusive of scrap product and lost sales, gross profit was impacted by approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
We anticipate production to resume early next month. 
Finally, as reported in the third quarter, the CHC Americas business continued to experience lower customer service levels, which led to production inefficiencies and operating variances. These factors, combined with higher year-over-year input cost, impacted gross profit by approximately $16 million. 
CHC International adjusted gross profit was unfavorably impacted by approximately $9 million in the fourth quarter due to currency translation movements. 
In the RX segment, while adjusted gross profit was down in the quarter due to lower net sales, adjusted gross margin was approximately 55%, an increase of 160 basis points, compared to the prior year, driven by the launch of higher-margin new products. 
Slide 12 outlines the primary operating expense drivers in our businesses. In the fourth quarter, we increased growth investments compared to the prior year on a constant-currency basis. 
In our consumer platforms, we prioritized investments to drive long range growth. Specifically, in the consumer international business, plain investments and advertising and R&D were approximately 16.1% as a percentage to net sales, compared to 12.5% in the prior year. 
Likewise, RX R&D investments were approximately 8% to net sales as we continued to invest in our strong pipeline. 
Selling and administration expenses benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, movements of approximately $6 million, lower compensation accruals in the quarter and continuing improvement actions in the cost structure of our consumer international segment. 
Turning to Slide 13. The major financial drivers I just reviewed resulted in consolidated adjusted operating income of $195 million, compared to $253 million in the prior year and a reduction in margins. 
A bit of perspective on margins. Our overall consolidated operating margin for the quarter was 16.3%, down approximately 350 basis points compared to the prior year, due primarily to: 1, the production issues in CHC Americas negatively impacted that segments adjusted operating margin by 400 basis points, and consolidated Perrigo adjusted margin by 225 basis points; and 2, in CHC International, the intentional investments to drive long-term growth in this business impacted the segment's adjusted operating margin by 350 basis points and consolidated Perrigo adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points. 
These are partially offset by RX where our adjusted operating margin increased year-over-year from 38.1% to 39.2% as we continue to invest in R&D. 
Slide 14 illustrates the overall consolidated adjusted operating results for the fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was consistent with our expectations at approximately 20%. 
Overall, adjusted earnings per share was $0.97, right in the middle of the revised guidance range we provided last call and despite the negative impact of approximately $0.08 per share from the Ohio facility equipment production issue. 
Turning now to Slide 15. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remained strong. Cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 147% for the quarter, which highlights the powerful cash flow generation of our business model. 
Of note, the December 31, 2018 balance sheet does not include the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment we received in the first quarter of 2019. 
Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our long-standing commitment to an investment grade financial policy. 
As Murray highlighted, we are looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will outline our strategic plan and our 2019 guidance framework. 
In the interim, we're highlighting a few key business trends headed into 2019. 
Our consumer businesses continued to grow, led by Store Brand penetration and a healthy new product pipeline in our consumer international business. 
And as a reminder, the loss of the partner product in our animal health business will anniversary midyear and will no longer affect year-over-year comparisons, starting in Q3 of 2019. 
Also given the current weakness of certain currencies to the U.S. dollar, translation exposure is expected to negatively impact 2019 growth in our consumer businesses by approximately 190 basis points as we stand here today. 
From an operating perspective, in our consumer businesses, there are 2 core macro themes headed into 2019. First, as our service levels in RX and CHC International business are operating above 90%, our top priority is the resolution of the operating variances and customer service dynamics in the Consumer Americas segment. 
Actions to improve service in this segment are underway and include, 1, adding capacity in our capital value stream; and 2, important process, technology and structural improvements to drive and sustain operational performance. 
As previously indicated, we are now refocused on regaining the Perrigo Advantage with customer service as a key pillar. 
This is a top priority while we are making progress. It will take time for these actions to be realized in our financial statements. 
As previously inventoried operating variances, royalty or income statement, in 2019, as the inventory sold in the first half of the year. This means the weakness we saw in the second half of 2018 will depress 2019's first half results in the form of higher cost to product sold. 
Second, we have already begun our strategic investments in various aspects of our consumer businesses as evidenced by the planned increase in advertising within the consumer international segment in the fourth quarter, along with build out of capabilities in R&D, innovation and business intelligence, which will also impact first half results. 
We will show specific actions to help offset these investments at our Investor Day, but they will come later in the year in the form of cost reduction programs. 
Given this operating framework, consumer adjusted operating margins are expected to be lower in the first half of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, improving as we march through the year. 
Finally, within the RX segment, there are 2 macro themes to consider. First, from a pricing perspective, we saw signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, and as I sit here today, we expect 2019 price headwinds in our core products to be consistent with our 2018 year-over-year fourth quarter results. 
And second, expect that we will continue to invest in our pipeline with dollar growth in R&D investments versus 2018. 
At our Investor Day, we plan to provide more details around each of these trends as we provide 2019 guidance at that time. 
As you complete your models, another important factor to keep in mind is our continued strong operating cash flow profile. 
In 2018, our adjusted operating cash flow conversion to adjusted net income once again exceeded 100%. 
Our teams continue to remain confident in our cash flow generation, which will factor into our framework around capital allocation that will also be outlined at the May 9 Investor Day. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

I think in 2018 alone, there were $55 million of purposely discontinued products. That's the right number, right, Ron? So you have to look at that growth within the context of what they've been doing consolidating markets. They've discontinued thousands of SKUs that were nonprofitable and that's how you're seeing the margin enhancement along with significant organizational changes. They're most of the way through, so you should start seeing the top line growth that's underlying on the core business to show itself in, in 2019 and I think there are plenty of opportunities and they have a very robust new product pipeline they've been working at. Having said all that, international, it has plenty of opportunities, it's not the issue facing the company and it's not in my mind what unlocks significant value for our investors. Right now, getting the Americas business right, getting service levels, getting that new product engine going again, revisiting and when it makes sense, bolt-on acquisitions and doing all the things that made Perrigo great before it started to focus, being distracted internationally and with a number of other things we did, is the top priority for this company to create value.

Could it influence the way we allocate capital, being a little more conservative, to shifting some money towards paying down debt for shares versus dividends, et cetera? We'll outline all of that in May 9 as well. So we want to make sure that we remove uncertainty to invest in us, so you don't have to be worried about that. And I've had to deal with that for over a decade in the previous industry I was in, but it does not get in the way of doing what we want to do. And what I think you will think about our capital structure, our balance sheet, everything, you should be thinking that we have our eyes clearly set on being a top-performing CPG consumer-based company with our evolution from healthcare to self-care.

When you talk about the consumer side of the business, that will be a major, major, major portion of May 9. But if I had to give you an example, and by the way, my answer is it can come from bolt-ons, it can come from innovation on core business, it can come from share building, and it all relates to the consumer understanding of how people buy our products and what our relative shares are in different categories. So let's use nicotine cessation as an example. That's a category where we're the market leader by far, much bigger than the national brand. If you're in that position, that means you need to be the one that's doing a lot of innovation and you may look at that and say, well in order to do that, you have to go through FDA, long slow processes. In that particular category, that's not true. There's nothing that stops us from innovating on forms, packaging, flavors and the like to drive that business and grow that category -- segment itself. As I sit here, coming from the industry I came in, we in the company at Perrigo think we've done a good job, but it's tiny compared to what's going on in the world of, let's give an example of how explosive vapor products have been to switch consumers from smoking to vapor. So the total tobacco industry starts at $100 billion, and we're a tiny fraction of that. So to me, just sort of treading water the way we are isn't good enough and innovation needs to ramp up with new forms and new ways to satisfy smokers, pretty much all of whom want to quit. So that would be an example of an area we would push for innovation. And I pick that one because we've already gone to market with a couple of SKUs this year that are not offered by the national brands."

And as Murray referenced, that anchor in 2018 -- as we go forward, we're not giving guidance, but we're largely behind us relative to the exiting and discontinuing of the portfolio and improving our focused brand strategy, that's largely done through 2018."

But I mean, what Svend and the team in international have done, they've done a masterful job of cleaning up this portfolio and getting their hands around a very complex and diversified portfolio, with a lot of things that didn't make sense and certain markets that didn't make sense. So you'll see how he's pruned the product lines, how he's pruned countries, how he's consolidated markets, how he's changed talent, all of that will become very apparent. But it will not be the same drag that it's been over the past couple of years. As it relates to guidance with or without RX, we hope to provide you, I mean, it depends how it progresses, but we would like to be able to provide you without, and show you the impact and where we are. That's what we're working towards, but we will see how it ultimately progresses. But I need you to get a good understanding of what RemainCo, the core business, looks like going forward. And by the way, that's how I'm going to be incenting the management team and leadership team going forward, of driving those consumer businesses going forward. As it relates to the level of investment, there's a number of things. There are some investments that are related to some new products that we'll spell those kinds of things out, but some of them are on longer-term plans, et cetera. I said on the last conference call that we had about the right level of R&D in total and about the right level of advertising on, in general on our core businesses in total. My concern on the R&D business right now, is not that there isn't sufficient money, it's the productivity of the initiatives. If you look a few years ago, and again, we'll show you all of this, we were getting bigger hits for our new product development program and higher productivity than we're getting today. They're working on just as many approvals, but we strategically have to identify the right and bigger ideas. And that's why I brought in Jim Dillard and consolidated R&D in the last month, who is a pro, who I -- and you'll love him when you meet him. He's a very aggressive guy and I think within a very short period of time, you're going to see that, that new product program ramp up pretty aggressively."

I'll start with the answer to your first couple of questions and come back on the tax side. So first of all, you asked about headwinds and quantifying those at the EPS level. I tried to give you some good numbers within my commentary, an",652,"Ami, this is Ron. I'll start with the answer to your first couple of questions and come back on the tax side. So first of all, you asked about headwinds and quantifying those at the EPS level. I tried to give you some good numbers within my commentary, and let me kind of break it down for you. So first of all, CHC Americas, let's focus on that segment. So we talked about gross margin effects, there was 2 items -- forget mix, because that ebbs and flows -- but the 2 items I highlighted pretty detailed was one, the Ohio issue, the facility issue. We talked about a $13 million impact in Q4. I also mentioned in my comments production starts in March. So what will happen, you have some overhang there. I'm not going to give you the dollar amount, but you're going to have some overhang, as that facility was down for 2 months, you get it back into production, you recognize the sales. So you're going to have some overhang in the first half of the year that converts into production and sales in the first half of 2019. The other one is, I think, rather quantified, and that was the one around service and production variances. I gave you a number of $16 million, that's a pretty firm number. In other words, that's what we have to work through now in Q1 and Q2 of 2019, as we've experienced those, we've -- if you look at the accounting, part of it goes to your balance sheet of terms with sales, but you could expect margin at CHC Americas to be in the zone that you saw in Q4, working its way back up to that 20% level as we exit the year. So we've been pretty open about that. It's going to take some time for those service -- service dynamics to kind of manifest themselves and benefit the P&L as we resolve the issues and sell the product that we've already produced. You asked about R&D. In the general context we look at R&D, and I'll reiterate Murray's comment, which I thought was a good one, we don't see R&D as a percent of sales changing materially in the consumer businesses. We look at productivity. In other words, if you look at the percent of sales, you may see a little bit of a change as a percent of sales in consumer. The real focus will be how do we get better value, margin value, per R&D dollar on a go-forward basis, is really the key focus of the team. So you'd have some percent of sales increase, but it won't be material. I did highlight in RX, R&D in RX will be up on a dollar basis. I didn't guide you on a percentage, but assume you take RX dollars in 2018, we are expecting, with our strong pipeline, to continue investing in that pipeline next year as well. So all of that carries forward some color. I should comment also on CHC International, play off, Chris Schott, your earlier question. Listen, we're confident in high-teens margins in this business. I just want to make sure we're very clear, CHC International, we are pointed at those high-teens. Now we've been messaging for some time we are reinvesting back in the business. Now we don't think we're going to go backwards at OI, OI margins, but you could see us pause. You could see us flatten out for years where we invest in the business, we invest in advertising and promotion next year and the like. But we're still confident in the next couple of years, we are pointed at that high-teen adjusted operating margin percent. So hopefully, that gives you, Ami, the answers to your questions on a go-forward look. On the tax side, I'll defer it, if it's fair, back to Murray on that."

So -- and then, depending on how it goes, either side would have the ability to appeal that.

On the ongoing service issues, of course it affects you. Part of your ability to withstand pricing pressure and everything else is your ability to both innovate and service at a higher level than anybody else. So when you don't, it creates more competition. That has to be this company or this division's top priority to fix that and it is. So I mean, you felt that and you see that in -- that the businesses were pressured somewhat to that. So all of these plans are designed to fix that, but in general, the business, despite that, has held up pretty well, still growing when you exclude Animal Health."

And in my comments, I commented we are putting capital into our Teva value stream. I mean, we have one high-class problem here, and that is volumes are up. We've just have not caught up with the volume spike and servicing our customers. So you will see some cash from a capital standpoint come in over the next 6 to 12 months as well. If we come back, you asked about RX, let me give you some details that you asked for here. So you asked about pricing, we do not quote pricing, just assume those are in the high single digits on our core products. We talked about Q3 was above that, right, north of 10. So again, we saw some stability. I'd like to say no erosion, but we're still seeing erosion, at a more stabilized level. You asked about launches going into next year. Listen, right now, you saw one come out, acyclovir, with an announcement we made most recently, it's a nice, I'll call it, a double, single double, that you'll see in our portfolio launch next year. ProAir, we're still optimistic. When you take a look at that product, we're working very closely with the FDA. We're committed to bringing a very important product to the marketplace and we're still optimistic to launch that product in the, I'll call it, for -- very near future.

We have products, 40% of our volume internationally is branded products that -- a number of those are in self-care categories that present opportunities here in the United States, as an example, and the company has a good track record of expanding. So it's a two-part answer, because the first part was some of the expansions we've done have been in the areas where there are good barriers to it, like infant nutrition or in nicotine cessation. Although, one could argue other companies could get into that, but we've done it so well with our overall store-brand model, which is hard to match up against. So there are plenty of opportunities for growth and companies do that all the time. And we will show you how we've done it in the past, how we'll do it in the future, at various levels, from incremental opportunities that help just keep the brands fresh and make it harder for competitors to sort of know where we're going next, all the way to bigger incremental opportunities, to potential bolt-ons that have the kind of barriers that you're talking about.

They have action standards that each of those -- that advertising has to hit. They have action standards on product testing, the product has to hit. Once it goes into the market, they measure those and they adjust and they look at the returns they're getting. And if the returns in market aren't generating the kind of returns and metrics that pay out that advertising, then they shift it elsewhere to somewhere that does. They have a priority list of probable -- this is a very big portfolio of brands and they have split the way they look at the business into sort of: their core growth brands; their exit brands, which we've already talked about; and their sustained brands. And they are, and again, we'll walk through all of that, but they put the most investment in the ones that meet the criteria to get into that growth category. So -- and markets, they go down and they look at profitability by SKU and all the metrics that you would expect. I'm not sure how to answer the consumer company. We will look at top quartile performance. We want to get to be a top quartile performer. That means we are going to measure and target revenue growth, EPS growth, margins, leverage, all the typical balance sheet metrics that you would look at, and that's what we will be working against over the next couple of years.

But in terms of the worst-case, if in fact you -- it's determined, however remote the possibility, that you do have to pay, an Irish tax expert told us there would be an 8% annual interest charge. And I think it was 5 years ago the transaction happened. And then there would be a penalty on top of that, anywhere from 3% to 100%, with 3% being what they call a general penalty, and 100% where there's deliberate, willful behavior. So is the calculation of worst-case somewhere between, no matter how remote it could be, $2.3 million and $3.9 million? Does that make sense? Second question, sorry, billion dollars. Second question is on the tuck-in. I think, Murray, you said you want to get back to what made the company great, i.e., tuck-ins. How does the outlook appear? Are you close on anything? Are you looking mostly domestically or internationally, private, public? And how are valuations shaping up right now? And then thirdly, just to clarify on the input cost you discussed, is this related to what a lot of companies are seeing now with rising input cost? And why is it just a short-term situation versus a longer-term impact?"

I mean, it makes no sense and I -- this company, if you look at -- read the challenge. To sit there and have a discussion of willful fraud or something like that is silly. But beyond that, we believe we win on the merits. We believe that when you look at the actual legitimate expectations that Elan Pharma had, based on 20 years of trading history, that this is unjust, and we will see how it plays out. But we have good advisers, a good team working on this and you're going to have to watch it. What you need to hear from me is, answering the question that was very early on in the call here, which is that this will not get in our way of our ability to go forward and do the strategic initiatives that we need to get Perrigo growing. And this will play out over the course of years and we will keep you informed. But I'm quite confident and have built a lot of value, whether it was at UST, which had a massive, and antitrust overhang on it; or on Lorillard that had massive regulatory challenges that were going on, on that business. So the key in my experience with those is we fight them very aggressively and fight on the behalf of our shareholders, especially when you believe you're right, and we do believe we're right. And then make sure that you're building the business. So top priority, top focus, is build the business. That's what's going to create value here. On the tuck-ins, I mean, my answer is almost like yes. It's, are we looking at all kinds of things and going through a funnel here and all that? We will put a -- we will scrutinize and make sure that we are making good investments, but there are many opportunities and we'll bring clarity to that on May 9. And I can hear the frustration by a lot of you, that you -- you're looking for more answers right now. It's not that far. In a couple of months here, we'll be back to you with the full plan."

These are industry issues, what makes sense from a partner perspective. I would say that probably, the biggest disappointment from my chair, traditionally, we are very, very good at offsetting input costs with productivity. And because some of the supply chain issues we've had in customer service and some of that complexity, we haven't been able to do that. So in my mind, that's the reason I look at these as short term. When we can get the supply chain back to the Perrigo Advantage and we can continue the productivity curve that we've been very successful at historically, we can offset these input costs in a productive way. That's the core focus that we have as a company, to ensure that we offset the input costs appropriately."

I have one quarter under my belt and I'm learning more and more about the business every day. 
My early observations of what the key issues facing Perrigo are, and what we need to do to fix the business, remain largely unchanged, and can be summarized as follows: first, the challenges that we face are fixable. The more time I've spent with the business, the more I've become comfortable that we can not only take Perrigo back to its prior strength, but that we can build on the platform to be even stronger. 
Second, new product volume and core brand innovation over the last few years has not been sufficient to offset increased price competition in the USA. 
Third, increased organizational complexity and lack of sufficient investment in capacity and technology has reduced the company's service levels and competitive advantage in an area that has historically been a core competency for Perrigo and which, inside the company, we rightly call the Perrigo Advantage. 
Fourth, overhangs of which the recent EUR 1.6 billion Irish notice of assessment is the most meaningful and which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes are a distraction and a resource drain. 
Fifth, over the last few years, Perrigo has not made the type of investments that had driven the company's success for so many years. That is a robust pipeline of new products and smaller bolt-on acquisitions. 
Sixth, our international consumer business is a good business with attractive upside potential, but has a legacy of having been managed as an amalgamation of many small businesses. 
Great progress has been made restructuring that business and reducing complexity, but there is much more to be done in order to enhance performance and margins. 
Overall, I like the business and it is performing better than most investors realize. 
Seventh, our generic RX business has diversified in highly differentiated pharmaceutical business, but when RX is combined with our consumer businesses, both become neglected. 
I continue to support the board's decision to separate the companies so they both can reach their full potential. 
Eighth, there is great talent within the company that was waiting to be unleashed and that is being done. There are also some important capability and skill gaps that needed to be addressed in the area of consumer marketing, R&D, innovation and business intelligence. Those voids have been filled with great talent both externally and internally. 
And ninth, the company's recent earnings guidance revisions have frustrated investors. While the fourth quarter results were relatively lackluster and negatively impacted by continued executional issues, we delivered exactly what we said we would, despite some pretty significant headwinds, so that's a start. 
Again, all of these issues are fixable and many are being addressed now with specific actions throughout our company. 
Most importantly, we have developed a new strategic plan, designed to help us deliver our new vision, which is to make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
The plan has been approved by our board, and we are now onto the implementation stage. We will share the full plan at our Investor Day, which has been scheduled for May 9 at the New York Stock Exchange. 
At that meeting, we will review how we are transforming Perrigo from a healthcare to a consumer self-care company to take advantage of a massive global consumer trend. 
We intend to provide detailed plans and actions we have already taken in the areas of portfolio reconfiguration, investments in capacity and technology, innovation initiatives, cost savings plans to help fuel growth, capital allocation plans and organizational effectiveness initiatives, including several key external hires. 
We will also provide calendar year 2019 guidance at that time. 
Turning to the fourth quarter of 2018, let me give you an overview of how I saw consolidated and segment commercial results. 
Reported fourth quarter net sales for the company were $1.2 billion, down 5% versus 1 year ago on an organic constant-currency basis and adjusted to diluted EPS was $0.97 as we guided, which was down 24% versus 1 year ago. 
We experienced operating income declines across all 3 of our segments for different reasons, which I'll detail in a minute, but at the 30,000-foot level, the consumer businesses in the Americas were negatively affected by cost and customer service. 
In our international segment, we purposefully invested in advertising and in R&D, and in RX, we continued to suffer from downward pricing pressure, albeit at a lower rate than we had been previously experiencing. 
In the consumer market segment. Consumer offtake and store brand market share continued to grow. Underlying revenue trends on our core businesses were relatively unchanged. 
Importantly, sales volumes on the base over-the-counter healthcare lines were once again solid, except for animal health, which you are aware of and has been discussed on previous calls. 
Execution in the fourth quarter remained sloppy, which depressed revenues and reduced margins. 
On top of challenged service levels, a significant equipment startup issue in the infant nutrition business resulted in a missed sales opportunity of $10 million with a onetime impact to gross profit of approximately $0.08 of adjusted EPS per share. 
Turning to consumer international. We continued to simplify and upgrade our offerings during 2018 and the fourth quarter. This purposeful pruning of our product lines, which has translated to higher margins mask sell our business as really performing. 
And our core international OTC brands representing 70% of consumer internationals net sales grew approximately 2.5% for the year and 1.5% for the fourth quarter, holding market share in the European OTC market that grew at roughly the same rate. 
We are especially pleased with momentum we are observing in the dermatological space with our ACO brand and cough, cold, and analgesics with our Solpadeine brand. 
Fourth quarter advertising and R&D was increased by $13 million or 28% on a constant-currency basis versus last year to keep the momentum going. 
And with the bulk of the product line pruning that has occurred over the last few years behind us, we anticipate top line growth in 2019 for our total international consumer segment. 
I'd also note customer service levels have averaged around 95% for the last year, a testament to this team's focus on keeping our winning brands on the shelves and available to consumers. 
Moving on to RX. It was a better quarter as we started to see the benefits of a solid pipeline of new products begin to positively impact the business in both revenue and margins. 
We saw margin improvement in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, benefiting from the launch of Testosterone 1.62% and an easing of downward pricing pressure. 
Revenues continued to decline year-over-year by approximately 15%, which is half the rate that we experienced in the third quarter. 
We expect this business segment to improve as its new product pipeline continues to come to market. 
For perspective, we have 10 tentative approvals awaiting final action and 65 new product projects under development or under FDA review. 
Also worth noting, customer service levels have been restored to greater than 90% and as it relates to the separation process, I won't comment on where we are right now on the sale or spin or in the Q&A other than to say it is on track and we remain committed to the strategic initiative. 
So, in summary, 2018 was a challenging year, but overall, our consumer businesses market shares were stable in growing markets. 
Executional issues are being addressed. We have restored customer service levels in the RX segment and we received the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. 
We have an exciting strategic plan that we believe will transform Perrigo back into a growing company with a bright future as we evolve from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. 
We note that 2019 will be a transformational year that implements the many major changes I have discussed and which we recognize makes it difficult right now to forecast our business. It is our intention to bring significant clarity to the strategy and transformation execution as well as provide full year 2019 guidance on May 9. 
One last topic I'd like to cover before I turn the call over to Ron. 2 days ago, Perrigo filed a petition within the Irish High Court because we strongly believe Irish revenues notice of assessment was issued in breach of the company's legitimate expectations regarding how it would be treated as a taxpayer. 
As we noted in our prior disclosure related to the Irish tax assessment, we strongly disagree with the assessment and believe that it is without merit and incorrect as a matter of law. 
We also said that the company would pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues that may be necessary or appropriate to challenge this assessment. 
We owe it to our shareholders to take every legitimate step to challenge this assessment and that is why we pursued this action in the Irish court. 
I will not go into the details of this filing other than to say this: First, we believe that Irish revenues assessment conflicts with revenues long-standing tax treatment of Elan Pharma, which was carrying on a trade of intellectual property for over 20 years. 
As noted in the judicial review proceedings, we believe that Irish revenue breached Elan Pharma's legitimate expectation, based on that tax history, when it wrongly recharacterized Elan Pharma's trade some 20 years later in the amended assessment. 
And second, the judicial review proceeding is a separate process that must be pursued in the Irish courts rather than before the Tax Appeals Commission. 
The appeal before the Tax Appeals Commission has been stayed until the court makes a decision in this judicial review proceeding. 
If the court finds that Elan Pharma's legitimate expectation was breached, the court would set aside the entire assessment. 
To be clear, this is a challenge of the process, not the assessment itself. 
If the court does not agree with our assertion, then we will proceed to challenge the tax assessment on its merit in the Tax Appeals Commission. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Ron Winowiecki, to cover more specific financial results for the fourth quarter and year. 
And while I said that we will not provide full 2019 guidance until our Investor Day meeting, he will give you some rough planning input as you think about your models. Ron?"
319092,602262835,1676592,"Perrigo Company plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2019",2019-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Perrigo Company plc","Executives","Thank you, Murray, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, with reported net income",1697,"Thank you, Murray, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I will now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. 
On a consolidated basis, reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, with reported net income of $82 million and reported EPS of $0.60 per share. 
A few adjustments to the GAAP P&L this quarter are worth noting. First, we recognized $170 million gain in our P&L resulting from the achievements and receipt of the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. 
As a reminder, we have the potential for another milestone receipt of $400 million in the event 2020 Tysabri sales exceed $1.95 billion. 
In addition, as we continue on our plan of separating the RX business, we expensed $7.3 million, which included a combination of technical  accounting, tax work streams and operational actions to segregate the business. 
GAAP tax expense as a percentage of pretax income was 60% in the quarter, compared to a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%. The difference was due primarily to the tax effect of the non-GAAP pretax adjustments and the effective valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and liabilities consistent with the adjusted pretax income. 
Now turning to Slide 10. On a consolidated net sales, we're approximately $1.2 billion, 7% lower than the prior year. 
Unfavorable foreign currency translation impacted net sales by approximately $18 million in the quarter. 
On an organic constant-currency basis, net sales decreased by approximately 5% due to the following: One, RX net sales were down approximately 15% as price erosion and lower volumes impacted the business. RX next sales were slightly above our expectations as we saw year-over-year pricing trends improve in the fourth quarter in our core generic portfolio. 
As we have discussed previously, our inability to supply certain products has resulted in lower volumes. However, it is worth noting the team has been focusing on correcting these issues and service levels have improved from the low to mid-80% range in mid 2018 to approximately 90% as we sit here today. 
New product sales of $22 million partially offset these declines. 2, net sales in the U.S. animal health business were approximately 50% lower than the prior year due to the previously disclosed loss of a partner product and Channel Dynamics. 
In the fourth quarter, excluding the animal health business, on an organic constant-currency basis, our worldwide consumer businesses were approximately 1% lower year-over-year. 
And 3, we experienced a temporary disruption caused by an equipment start up issue at one of our infant formula facilities and, as Murray stated, this disruption caused net sales in the quarter to be lower by approximately $10 million. 
I will discuss the startup issue in more detail shortly. 
Now turning to Slide 11. Adjusted gross profit was approximately $490 million or $75 million lower than the prior year. 
CHC Americas adjusted gross profit was more than half of the decline, down approximately $44 million compared to the prior year due to the following factors: first, lower net sales and unfavorable product mix accounted for approximately $15 million of this variance. 
Second, our infant formula plan in Ohio had undergone a series of major equipment updates as part of our ongoing investment in capacity to support growth in this business. 
When restarting production in this facility, during the fourth quarter, our quality system identified equipment variations inconsistent with our quality control standards. 
Accordingly, inclusive of scrap product and lost sales, gross profit was impacted by approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
We anticipate production to resume early next month. 
Finally, as reported in the third quarter, the CHC Americas business continued to experience lower customer service levels, which led to production inefficiencies and operating variances. These factors, combined with higher year-over-year input cost, impacted gross profit by approximately $16 million. 
CHC International adjusted gross profit was unfavorably impacted by approximately $9 million in the fourth quarter due to currency translation movements. 
In the RX segment, while adjusted gross profit was down in the quarter due to lower net sales, adjusted gross margin was approximately 55%, an increase of 160 basis points, compared to the prior year, driven by the launch of higher-margin new products. 
Slide 12 outlines the primary operating expense drivers in our businesses. In the fourth quarter, we increased growth investments compared to the prior year on a constant-currency basis. 
In our consumer platforms, we prioritized investments to drive long-range growth. Specifically, in the consumer international business, plain investments and advertising and R&D were approximately 16.1% as a percentage to net sales, compared to 12.5% in the prior year. 
Likewise, RX R&D investments were approximately 8% to net sales as we continued to invest in our strong pipeline. 
Selling and administration expenses benefited from favorable foreign currency translation, movements of approximately $6 million, lower compensation accruals in the quarter and continuing improvement actions in the cost structure of our consumer international segment. 
Turning to Slide 13. The major financial drivers I just reviewed resulted in consolidated adjusted operating income of $195 million, compared to $253 million in the prior year and a reduction in margins. 
A bit of perspective on margins. Our overall consolidated operating margin for the quarter was 16.3%, down approximately 350 basis points compared to the prior year, due primarily to: 1, the production issues in CHC Americas negatively impacted that segments adjusted operating margin by 400 basis points, and consolidated Perrigo adjusted margin by 225 basis points; and 2, in CHC International, the intentional investments to drive long-term growth in this business impacted the segment's adjusted operating margin by 350 basis points and consolidated Perrigo adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points. 
These are partially offset by RX where our adjusted operating margin increased year-over-year from 38.1% to 39.2% as we continue to invest in R&D. 
Slide 14 illustrates the overall consolidated adjusted operating results for the fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was consistent with our expectations at approximately 20%. 
Overall, adjusted earnings per share was $0.97, right in the middle of the revised guidance range we provided last call and despite the negative impact of approximately $0.08 per share from the Ohio facility equipment production issue. 
Turning now to Slide 15. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remained strong. Cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 147% for the quarter, which highlights the powerful cash flow generation of our business model. 
Of note, the December 31, 2018 balance sheet does not include the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment we received in the first quarter of 2019. 
Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our long-standing commitment to an investment grade financial policy. 
As Murray highlighted, we are looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will outline our strategic plan and our 2019 guidance framework. 
In the interim, we're highlighting a few key business trends headed into 2019. 
Our consumer businesses continued to grow, led by Store Brand penetration and a healthy new product pipeline in our consumer international business. 
And as a reminder, the loss of the partner product in our animal health business will anniversary midyear and will no longer affect year-over-year comparisons, starting in Q3 of 2019. 
Also given the current weakness of certain currencies to the U.S. dollar, translation exposure is expected to negatively impact 2019 growth in our consumer businesses by approximately 190 basis points as we stand here today. 
From an operating perspective, in our consumer businesses, there are 2 core macro themes headed into 2019. First, as our service levels in RX and CHC International business are operating above 90%, our top priority is the resolution of the operating variances and customer service dynamics in the Consumer Americas segment. 
Actions to improve service in this segment are underway and include, 1, adding capacity in our capital value stream; and 2, important process, technology and structural improvements to drive and sustain operational performance. 
As previously indicated, we are now refocused on regaining the Perrigo Advantage with customer service as a key pillar. 
This is a top priority while we are making progress. It will take time for these actions to be realized in our financial statements. 
As previously inventoried operating variances, royalty or income statement, in 2019, as the inventory sold in the first half of the year. This means the weakness we saw in the second half of 2018 will depress 2019's first half results in the form of higher cost to product sold. 
Second, we have already begun our strategic investments in various aspects of our consumer businesses as evidenced by the planned increase in advertising within the consumer international segment in the fourth quarter, along with build out of capabilities in R&D, innovation and business intelligence, which will also impact first half results. 
We will show specific actions to help offset these investments at our Investor Day, but they will come later in the year in the form of cost reduction programs. 
Given this operating framework, consumer adjusted operating margins are expected to be lower in the first half of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, improving as we march through the year. 
Finally, within the RX segment, there are 2 macro themes to consider. First, from a pricing perspective, we saw signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, and as I sit here today, we expect 2019 price headwinds in our core products to be consistent with our 2018 year-over-year fourth quarter results. 
And second, expect that we will continue to invest in our pipeline with dollar growth in R&D investments versus 2018. 
At our Investor Day, we plan to provide more details around each of these trends as we provide 2019 guidance at that time. 
As you complete your models, another important factor to keep in mind is our continued strong operating cash flow profile. 
In 2018, our adjusted operating cash flow conversion to adjusted net income once again exceeded 100%. 
Our teams continue to remain confident in our cash flow generation, which will factor into our framework around capital allocation that will also be outlined at the May 9 Investor Day. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

Louise, it's a little bit hard to answer the question on growth without you seeing the entire plan, which is the whole point of the May 9 Investor Day because there are -- I keep setting the stage for multiple components. So we obviously believe we're going to be, as Ron said, starting the year a little bit slower because of cost. But then as we start to bring a number of these initiatives, which we will give you real-life example of, there's no way for you to be forecasting them in your trends. So I hate to say it, but you're going to have to wait to see the plan in May 9. So I tried to give you a little bit of a new piece of information that I haven't seen people talking about much, which is that we understand there is dilution from the separation, we understand that there are investments and that -- so that's why you heard us talking about there will be a cost component to this initiative as well, which, again, is difficult for you to model. But you're going to see some major, major change coming in here in May, and I think, and hope, that you'll be very excited about where we're going when you see it. I don't know if you want to add anything to it, Ron, because I'm not going to put any percentages against the lawsuit."

The second one is just I'm trying to get my hands around with this pending tax liability, I know you've got a very strong -- I knew you have a very strong view of this, this is something you will prevail, ultimately, but how does that pending liability impact your capital deployment priorities and how you think about putting capital to work as you look to reposition the consumer business while you're waiting for some of the organic kind of initiatives to take hold?"

I think in 2018 alone, there were $55 million of purposely discontinued products. That's the right number, right, Ron? So you have to look at that growth within the context of what they've been doing consolidating markets. They've discontinued thousands of SKUs that were nonprofitable and that's how you're seeing the margin enhancement along with significant organizational changes. They're most of the way through, so you should start seeing the top line growth that's underlying on the core business to show itself in, in 2019 and I think there are plenty of opportunities and they have a very robust new product pipeline they've been working at. Having said all that, international, it has plenty of opportunities, it's not the issue facing the company and it's not in my mind what unlocks significant value for our investors. Right now, getting the Americas business right, getting service levels, getting that new product engine going again, revisiting and when it makes sense, bolt-on acquisitions and doing all the things that made Perrigo great before it started to focus, being distracted internationally and with a number of other things we did, is the top priority for this company to create value. So job #1 is the Americas. As it relates to -- give me the second question again?"

And I've had to deal with that for over a decade in the previous industry I was in, but it does not get in the way of doing what we want to do.

So question number one, can you give us some concrete examples in terms of things that you can do to drive the growth higher? Is this going to be largely a bolt-on strategy or there's things that you can do with the core business? And then the second question is, are we going to get an RX announcement on May 9?

I mean, I'm never ever going to sit here and make an ultimatum and say nothing could adjust our plans, but I don't see it right now. When you talk about the consumer side of the business, that will be a major, major, major portion of May 9. But if I had to give you an example, and by the way, my answer is it can come from bolt-ons, it can come from innovation on core business, it can come from share building, and it all relates to the consumer understanding of how people buy our products and what our relative shares are in different categories. So let's use nicotine cessation as an example. That's a category where we're the market leader by far, much bigger than the national brand. If you're in that position, that means you need to be the one that's doing a lot of innovation and you may look at that and say, well in order to do that, you have to go through FDA, long slow processes. In that particular category, that's not true. There's nothing that stops us from innovating on forms, packaging, flavors and the like to drive that business and grow that category -- segment itself. As I sit here, coming from the industry I came in, we in the company at Perrigo think we've done a good job, but it's tiny compared to what's going on in the world of, let's give an example of how explosive vapor products have been to switch consumers from smoking to vapor. So the total tobacco industry starts at $100 billion, and we're a tiny fraction of that. So to me, just sort of treading water the way we are isn't good enough and innovation needs to ramp up with new forms and new ways to satisfy smokers, pretty much all of whom want to quit. So that would be an example of an area we would push for innovation. And I pick that one because we've already gone to market with a couple of SKUs this year that are not offered by the national brands."

I said on the last conference call that we had about the right level of R&D in total and about the right level of advertising on, in general on our core businesses in total. My concern on the R&D business right now, is not that there isn't sufficient money, it's the productivity of the initiatives. If you look a few years ago, and again, we'll show you all of this, we were getting bigger hits for our new product development program and higher productivity than we're getting today. They're working on just as many approvals, but we strategically have to identify the right and bigger ideas.

So first of all, you asked about headwinds and quantifying those at the EPS level. I tried to give you some good numbers within my commentary, and let me kind of break it down for you. So first of all, CHC Americas, let's focus on that segment. So we talked about gross margin effects, there was 2 items -- forget mix, because that ebbs and flows -- but the 2 items I highlighted pretty detailed was one, the Ohio issue, the facility issue. We talked about a $13 million impact in Q4. I also mentioned in my comments production starts in March. So what will happen, you have some overhang there. I'm not going to give you the dollar amount, but you're going to have some overhang, as that facility was down for 2 months, you get it back into production, you recognize the sales. So you're going to have some overhang in the first half of the year that converts into production and sales in the first half of 2019. The other one is, I think, rather quantified, and that was the one around service and production variances. I gave you a number of $16 million, that's a pretty firm number. In other words, that's what we have to work through now in Q1 and Q2 of 2019, as we've experienced those, we've -- if you look at the accounting, part of it goes to your balance sheet of terms with sales, but you could expect margin at CHC Americas to be in the zone that you saw in Q4, working its way back up to that 20% level as we exit the year. So we've been pretty open about that. It's going to take some time for those service -- service dynamics to kind of manifest themselves and benefit the P&L as we resolve the issues and sell the product that we've already produced. You asked about R&D. In the general context we look at R&D, and I'll reiterate Murray's comment, which I thought was a good one, we don't see R&D as a percent of sales changing materially in the consumer businesses. We look at productivity. In other words, if you look at the percent of sales, you may see a little bit of a change as a percent of sales in consumer. The real focus will be how do we get better value, margin value, per R&D dollar on a go-forward basis, is really the key focus of the team. So you'd have some percent of sales increase, but it won't be material. I did highlight in RX, R&D in RX will be up on a dollar basis. I didn't guide you on a percentage, but assume you take RX dollars in 2018, we are expecting, with our strong pipeline, to continue investing in that pipeline next year as well. So all of that carries forward some color. I should comment also on CHC International, play off, Chris Schott, your earlier question. Listen, we're confident in high-teens margins in this business. I just want to make sure we're very clear, CHC International, we are pointed at those high-teens. Now we've been messaging for some time we are reinvesting back in the business. Now we don't think we're going to go backwards at OI, OI margins, but you could see us pause. You could see us flatten out for years where we invest in the business, we invest in advertising and promotion next year and the like. But we're still confident in the next couple of years, we are pointed at that high-teen adjusted operating margin percent. So hopefully, that gives you, Ami, the answers to your questions on a go-forward look. On the tax side, I'll defer it, if it's fair, back to Murray on that."

And in my comments, I commented we are putting capital into our Teva value stream. I mean, we have one high-class problem here, and that is volumes are up. We've just have not caught up with the volume spike and servicing our customers. So you will see some cash from a capital standpoint come in over the next 6 to 12 months as well. If we come back, you asked about RX, let me give you some details that you asked for here. So you asked about pricing, we do not quote pricing, just assume those are in the high single digits on our core products. We talked about Q3 was above that, right, north of 10. So again, we saw some stability. I'd like to say no erosion, but we're still seeing erosion, at a more stabilized level. You asked about launches going into next year. Listen, right now, you saw one come out, acyclovir, with an announcement we made most recently, it's a nice, I'll call it, a double, single double, that you'll see in our portfolio launch next year. ProAir, we're still optimistic. When you take a look at that product, we're working very closely with the FDA. We're committed to bringing a very important product to the marketplace and we're still optimistic to launch that product in the, I'll call it, for -- very near future. But again, we haven't announced a launch and we'll keep the market updated as we move forward with that important launch as well, Elliot."

It may not be a strict FDA and it won't be, and we do that all the time. We have products, 40% of our volume internationally is branded products that -- a number of those are in self-care categories that present opportunities here in the United States, as an example, and the company has a good track record of expanding. So it's a two-part answer, because the first part was some of the expansions we've done have been in the areas where there are good barriers to it, like infant nutrition or in nicotine cessation. Although, one could argue other companies could get into that, but we've done it so well with our overall store-brand model, which is hard to match up against. So there are plenty of opportunities for growth and companies do that all the time. And we will show you how we've done it in the past, how we'll do it in the future, at various levels, from incremental opportunities that help just keep the brands fresh and make it harder for competitors to sort of know where we're going next, all the way to bigger incremental opportunities, to potential bolt-ons that have the kind of barriers that you're talking about. So we'll give you -- I'll tell you, one of the biggest changes I've had from my old job to this new job is just how many opportunities there are, and it's sorting through, finding and making sure we're investing in the right ones.

So when they go through a very traditional -- they're more of a traditional consumer company than we are here in the U.S., which is more of a store-brand business. So that means everything from the quantification of the idea to when they're going to do any kind of advertising, they test the advertising in various research services. They have action standards that each of those -- that advertising has to hit. They have action standards on product testing, the product has to hit. Once it goes into the market, they measure those and they adjust and they look at the returns they're getting. And if the returns in market aren't generating the kind of returns and metrics that pay out that advertising, then they shift it elsewhere to somewhere that does. They have a priority list of probable -- this is a very big portfolio of brands and they have split the way they look at the business into sort of: their core growth brands; their exit brands, which we've already talked about; and their sustained brands. And they are, and again, we'll walk through all of that, but they put the most investment in the ones that meet the criteria to get into that growth category. So -- and markets, they go down and they look at profitability by SKU and all the metrics that you would expect. I'm not sure how to answer the consumer company. We will look at top quartile performance. We want to get to be a top quartile performer. That means we are going to measure and target revenue growth, EPS growth, margins, leverage, all the typical balance sheet metrics that you would look at, and that's what we will be working against over the next couple of years. And then hopefully get the multiples that those consumer companies earn, which is part of the idea here."

So obviously, best case is you don't have to pay any money, although you don't know the timing. But in terms of the worst-case, if in fact you -- it's determined, however remote the possibility, that you do have to pay, an Irish tax expert told us there would be an 8% annual interest charge. And I think it was 5 years ago the transaction happened. And then there would be a penalty on top of that, anywhere from 3% to 100%, with 3% being what they call a general penalty, and 100% where there's deliberate, willful behavior. So is the calculation of worst-case somewhere between, no matter how remote it could be, $2.3 million and $3.9 million? Does that make sense? Second question, sorry, billion dollars. Second question is on the tuck-in. I think, Murray, you said you want to get back to what made the company great, i.e., tuck-ins. How does the outlook appear? Are you close on anything? Are you looking mostly domestically or internationally, private, public? And how are valuations shaping up right now? And then thirdly, just to clarify on the input cost you discussed, is this related to what a lot of companies are seeing now with rising input cost?

But beyond that, we believe we win on the merits. We believe that when you look at the actual legitimate expectations that Elan Pharma had, based on 20 years of trading history, that this is unjust, and we will see how it plays out. But we have good advisers, a good team working on this and you're going to have to watch it. What you need to hear from me is, answering the question that was very early on in the call here, which is that this will not get in our way of our ability to go forward and do the strategic initiatives that we need to get Perrigo growing. And this will play out over the course of years and we will keep you informed. But I'm quite confident and have built a lot of value, whether it was at UST, which had a massive, and antitrust overhang on it; or on Lorillard that had massive regulatory challenges that were going on, on that business. So the key in my experience with those is we fight them very aggressively and fight on the behalf of our shareholders, especially when you believe you're right, and we do believe we're right. And then make sure that you're building the business. So top priority, top focus, is build the business. That's what's going to create value here. On the tuck-ins, I mean, my answer is almost like yes. It's, are we looking at all kinds of things and going through a funnel here and all that? We will put a -- we will scrutinize and make sure that we are making good investments, but there are many opportunities and we'll bring clarity to that on May 9.

And because some of the supply chain issues we've had in customer service and some of that complexity, we haven't been able to do that. So in my mind, that's the reason I look at these as short term.

For the most part, I'm pleased with the second quarter results and importantly, I like the direction the Perrigo is heading. 
Since we shared our strategic direction at May 9th Investor Day, and even before them, we've been moving quickly to execute on the 40 major initiatives we discussed. Initiatives that must happen if we're to successfully transform Perrigo from a Healthcare Company to a Consumer Self-Care Company. While we are still in the early stages, significant progress was made during the second quarter. 
A few examples. Strong customer service levels have been restored in our Americas and our X businesses and are once north of 90%. 
Our new products program is beginning to yield higher results, especially in Europe behind the launch of XLS [ Fortified ] and strong performance by the Opco brand. New products yielded $65 million in consolidated net sales during the quarter. 
Third, we closed on the divestiture of the Animal Health Business for $185 million. 
Fourth, we also closed on the acquisition of Ranir, the world's leading store brand Oral Self-Care Company, and raised guidance to reflect the incremental business. Ranir will have a very positive effect on our consolidated results in the second half of the year. 
We also completed the roadmap of our $100 million project momentum cost savings initiative. We'll show specific plans on the follow on this plan, which is crucial to offset the stranded cost resulting from the eventual separation of our RX business. 
And finally, we've incrementally improved our forecast accuracy, as evidenced, by making this quarter's adjusted EPS results, marketing our third consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding analyst expectations. 
The most important is that I feel the excitement building among our employees throughout Perrigo. Like me, they believe that the company is getting back on track. I'm delighted to see throughout the company a commitment to our new self-care vision and the priorities necessary to make that vision a reality. 
Transformations don't happen without commitment to assure vision, and we have it. 
This excitement and energy is beginning to show itself in business results, which I will briefly discuss. Our CFO, Ray Silcock will provide the specific GAAP and adjusted results, which you can also see reconciled in the earnings release. But I will be speaking to the adjusted results. 
Adjusted net sales grew 1% for Perrigo on a consolidated basis, excluding Animal Health, infant food and currency. 
Customer Self-Care Americas adjusted net sales also increased almost 1% for the quarter, excluding Animal Health and infant foods, driven by a very strong quarter for our core OTC business. 
Perrigo OTC sales, which represents approximately 80% of the Americas business, increased a robust 4% for the quarter and volume increased nearly 6%, tracing to an increase in category demand, associated with an extended cough cold season, a good start to the allergy season and strength in our smoking [indiscernible] at GI categories. For perspective, OTC category growth, consumption that is, rate tripled during the quarter versus a year ago from 1.1% to 3.5%. 
Store brand outpaced that growth, increasing 3.8%, meaning storebrand's once again, gained share from national brands. 
I wasn't happy with the performance of our infant formula business for the quarter, which declined almost 15% versus a year ago. The vast majority of that decline was driven by our contract sales business, which suffered due to inventory issues among several of our branded customers that made the strategic decision to exit infant formula. The performance was also effected by a product recall at a leading customer. But importantly, consumer demand owner-store brand business has returned to near pre-recall levels. So the good news here is that as contract packed inventory is correct, we would expect this business in our total nutrition business to quickly stabilize in the second half. 
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales, excluding currency, declined nearly 2% versus year ago, but the results there are better than they look. We had a short-term hiccup in France, associated with the sales force restructuring that was large enough to offset growth on the rest of the International business, that is excluding France and currency, CSCI was up 1%. And remember what I shared with you on Investor Day about our purposeful exit of certain nonstrategic brands, representing about 4% of the business last year. Well, that's down to 3% this year already. So when you look at our core branded consumer products portfolio, it grew 3% for the quarter, driven by nearly $30 million in new product launches. 
We believe the CSCI transformation is well underway and are working to resolve the short-term issues in France during the second half of the year. 
And importantly, in markets with attractive growth, we continue to maintain our market share across Europe, led by our core products. 
Our non-core RX segment continued to also perform well and outperform most generic RX companies my posting another quarter of topline net sales growth of more than 3%. 
We continue to see a moderation of downward pricing pressure and the business benefited, like, Consumer Americas, from improved customer service levels. The RX separation continues to be a strategic priority, and we continue to work on effecting a separation. 
But uncertainty in the market and generic pharmaceuticals industry generally, right now, requires us to reevaluate timing, so as to optimize value for our shareholders. Be clear, our RX business remain strong, and we believe as relatively modest exposures to the factors affecting the industry right now, we have written this business to growth. And we expect it will deliver attractive cash flow as we work towards separation. We will keep you posted. But again, to be clear, we remain committed to the separation and to transforming Perrigo into a pure play consumer company. 
Looking forward, we have a lot to do. And as I've said before, the transformational take several years. We are making good progress, and I expect that progress to the more visible through accelerated net sales growth in the second half of the year as we integrate Ranir and we see more of our initiatives come to market. 
I remain excited about what we as a team are doing at Perrigo, and I am confident that we will recapture the Perrigo advantage. I know we will make lives better by bringing Quality Affordable Healthcare Products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
And with that I'll turn the call over to Ray."

I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning's press release. I should note that there are also some explanatory financial charts on our website for additional clarity. 
Moving now to our second quarter results. Consolidated reported net sales were $1.15 billion in Q2, 3% lower than for the same quarter last year. Consolidated adjusted net sales were 1% higher in Q2 than in the same quarter last year, after excluding adverse foreign currency movements, the Animal Health business, held for sale in Q2 and then divested at the beginning of Q3 and the infant foods business that we executed at the end of last year. 
Consolidated reported net income for the quarter was $9 million, and reported EPS was $0.07 a share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $117 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.86 a share. 
Total adjustments in the quarter amounted to $108 million. We had $74 million of amortization expense, primarily related to previously acquired intangible assets and the $28 million impairment charge of a certain definite [indiscernible] asset acid in our RX business. 
We also incurred $12 million in restructuring charges, primarily due to the reorganization of our sales force in France as well as an $8 million adjustment for a combination of accounting and operational expenses, primarily related to the planned separation of the RX business, plus $3 million of other smaller adjustments, all partially offset by a $17 million non-GAAP tax adjustment. These adjustments can be found delineated in more detail in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release. 
Our reported effective tax rate was unusually high for this quarter, at 67%, driven by the RX impairment charge of $28 million in the quarter, that was not tax deduct able. Adding this impairment charge back to our adjusted pretax income, increased the denominator of the adjusted tax rate formula with no change to tax expense. This was the primary reason for the reduction of our adjusted effective tax rate to 23.1%. 
In Q2, Worldwide Consumer reported net sales of $910 million, 5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Worldwide Consumer adjusted net sales were flat as compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impact of adverse foreign currency movements mother held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we execute at the end of last year. 
Total new product sales of $38 million and strong volume in our core U.S. OTC business were more than offset by lower sales volume in our international segments. 
CSCA reported net sales of $582 million in Q2, down 2.5% from the prior year. Adjusted net sales for Q2 were $559 million, 1% higher than for the same period last year, when the health of sale animal health business in the infant foods business that we exited are excluded. 
Net sales from our market-leading U.S. OTC business increased by more than 4% compared to the same quarter prior year. But these increases were partially offset by lower sales of infant formula. 
International reported net sales of $328 million in the quarter, 8.5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Excluding adverse currency movements, sales were down 1.8% from Q2 last year. Strong new product sales of $30 million were more than offset by the impact of discontinued products, lower sales in the certain categories and in France. Lower sales in France was primarily due to a lack of sales coverage there as a realignment of the sales force, part of a number of business optimization initiatives underway in CSCI, as we seek to increase productivity and achieve better profitability on the resulted in temporary business disruptions. 
In realigning the sales force, we offered early reassignment packages to help us convince 3 sales forces into 1 to improve efficiency and effectiveness. More French sales employees took early retirement than have been anticipated, resulting in a reduction of sales effectiveness in the quarter. We expect this disruption to be remedied by year-end as we higher, train and deploy new sales people. 
When the year-over-year decrease in net sales in France is excluded, in addition to the effect of currency movements, CSCI net sales would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
Moving on to gross profit. In Q2, Worldwide Consumer had adjusted gross profit of $366 million, down $42 million from the same quarter last year. Excluding businesses held for sale and adjusting for the impact of currency, second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 3% from Q2 last year. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit was a $190 million, down 10.7% compared to the same quarter last year. This decline was principally due to lower infant formula contract manufacturing as well as operational inefficiencies resulting from higher scrap and some raw materials price inflation. These were partially offset by improved business performance within the U.S. OTC business and by new products introductions. 
Sequentially, compared to our first quarter, Americas adjusted gross profit margin increased 150 basis points to 34%, primarily due to favorable product mix and higher volumes in our OTC category. 
In the International segment, adjusted gross profit was $179 million, down 10.1% compared to the same quarter last year. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted gross profit was down 3.7% compared to prior year, primarily as a result of adverse product mix and the impact from that sales force realignment in France, partially offset by successful products as we continue to reap the benefits of a healthy new product pipeline. 
Continuing on down to P&L, Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating expenses were flat to last year, excluding the impact of currency and held for sale business, adjusted operating expenses were up 8% as a result of [ 1.265% ] compared to prior year. 
Two, performance-based compensation plan accruals being returned to 100%. And three, the absence of a onetime insurance recovery that benefited the second quarter last year. 
Moving on to adjusted operating margin, Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating income in Q2 amounted to $118 million, down from $161 million last year and adjusted operating margin of 13.3% versus 16.8% in the prior year. 
CSCA's adjusted operating at 20 -- operating margin of 20.3% was down 130 basis points from Q2 last year, with lower SG&A expense being partially offset by increased R&D spending, when the $50 million upfront license fee for NASONEX, which was charged to R&D in Q2 last year is excluded. 
Sequentially, the Americas adjusted operating margin was up 200 basis points from prior quarter, due to gross profit flow-through and lower SG&A expenses. In the international segment adjusted operating margin was stable at 15.3% versus 15.6% last year and 15.4% and this year's first quarter. 
Turning now to the RX segment. Net sales for the quarter were $239 million, 3.4% higher as compared to prior year. New product sales of $27 million and improved customer service were partially offset by continued moderating downward pricing pressure and by the impact of discontinued products. 
Adjusted gross profit of $100 million in the quarter was $16 million lower than in Q2 last year, primarily due to the continued downward pricing pressure and a less favorable product mix, including higher volumes this year of relatively lower margin authorized generic products. RX adjusted operating income of $66 million was down $13 million compared to last year as the gross margin shortfall was partially offset by lower administrative expenses as compared to the prior year. R&D expenses were at a similar to that of last year. 
In summary, Perrigo consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.86, better than we had expected, primarily due to improved business performance by both our Americas OTC business and the RX segment. And also as a result of timing differences, as our expectation in R&D and AMP expenditures that we now anticipating incurring in the second half of the year. 
A quick comment on the balance sheet. Our working capital levels were up in the second quarter as we build inventories in order to address some customer service issues and in anticipation of plant maintenance and needs. As a result, cash flow from operations was significantly lower than normal in Q2, with cash flow as a percent -- cash flow conversion, that is, as a percent of adjusted net income at 60% for the quarter. 
For the balance of the year, we anticipate the cash flow conversion, including from Ranir, will return to between 90% and 97% of adjusted net income. 
Following the Ranir acquisition, we are planning to refinance our existing term loan with a new $600 million facility, the proceeds of which we will use to repay our existing term loan and reduce the balance on our revolving credit facility. We expect that the refinancing will close by the end of this month, will be leverage-neutral and we lower interest expense by $2.5 million for the balance of 2019. 
Turning now to guidance for the balance of the current year. Our consolidated adjusted EPS guidance is unchanged for the year in the range of $3.75 therapeutic $4.05 a share, with net sales in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion. 
Adjusted Worldwide Consumer net sales on constant currency basis for 2019, excluding exited businesses are expected to grow by about 5% versus last year. We anticipate the sales growth being driven primarily by the acquisition of Ranir by better performance in our core U.S. OTC business, but from a strong pipeline of new product launches in international. The RX business continues to perform well, in spite of the challenging generic marketplace, we continue to anticipate net sales growth this year as a result of a strong new product pipeline and moderation of the downward pricing pressure on this business. 
Please bear in mind this guidance does not include any impact in 2019 from generic ProAir. Potential upsides for the balance of 2019 are the launch of generic ProAir, which if achieved, could add as much as $0.10 per share per quarter, and incremental cost savings from project momentum of up to $0.05 a share. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

If it was to be as spin, has to be very healthy and so does remain code, and that has able to execute on those strategic plans. There's a lot of options do that. And one of those options is simply the slow down a little bit and collect a very stable cash flow. And I feel good about the way that business has stabilized and the new product pipeline that's come to fruition, that was a little dry a year ago. And I think you felt the company was going generic ProAir, that didn't happen. But it expected it to happen a year ago and has now I'm getting the benefit of the pipeline supposed to come behind it is now coming to the marketplace and there's more behind that. So I don't see a gap in the company's ability to compete and the pricing at least for now feels like has the downward pricing pressure is not nearly to the extent it was on our business, which admittedly pretty differentiated versus others. 
On the customer service, I try to get some metrics in there. We are unreally pleased with the work that's going, although it's a bit manual. So we strategically built inventories, which cost us some working capital during the quarter as we referred to. And got ourselves back to good customer service levels in the [ 90s ], which was -- we were in the low -- we were in the mid-70s when I joined the company. So the important part there is the conversations in our owner customers office are no longer just what's going on the service, what going on with service. We're back to having conversations on building the business in new product and incremental opportunities and partnerships and all the things we're supposed to be doing instead of covering for and explaining we're not doing it the most basic things we're supposed to do well. So I like that. I like to not have that increased inventory the permanent. So there's a lot of work underway to systematize and with systems and process that you're making great progress on to the more nimble and the able to keep those service levels without the extra working capital."

But I love the way they are focused on, not just national brand equivalent, but national brand better and national brand different.

As it relates to our core business, I gave you and opportunities despite the tough recorder, I believe nutrition is a big opportunity for this company. And we are narrowing your focus I think nicotine cessation has to focus into tiny and that's why I said that we're inside the technology agreement and developed codevelopment agreement on how we could use sort of the responsibility of Perrigo to work with the FDA to solve some of the problems and into bring solutions to smokers want to quit in a form that they like, that the FDA can get behind them. And that'll take were, those aren't easy things to do, but I believe that nicotine cessation is led by couple of percent of the total tobacco industry numbers, with the entire consumer base willing to quit. So it's got to be an opportunity for us and international the weight loss e-commerce, that there's just like,  i think we illustrated $0.5 billion of new products that we have put into the pipeline. So we'll keep you posted as we go forward, and I think I left down naturals as another area. But there is a lacking of opportunities. There has to the strong discipline. And I continue on the process by and opposed the organization hard and as an example, this board meeting we have done the Ranir, but we got approval to a comprehensive M&A strategy going forward, that laid out the priorities in the finals that we could go out and do these kinds of both towns, but the drill bit discipline that create shareholder value."

This first phase was that we're focused on next year and a half plus overhead related and so operating expenses not plus product sold or manufacturing et cetera. So Phase II for us, which we're just entering, and I have no idea the size of that number as we sit here today is to begin to do the work in that area.

For the most part, I'm pleased with the second quarter results, and importantly, I like the direction Perrigo is heading. 
Since we shared our strategic direction at May 9 Investor Day, and even before then, we've been moving quickly to execute on the 40 major initiatives we discussed. Initiatives that must happen if we are to successfully transform Perrigo from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. While we are still in the early stages, significant progress was made during the second quarter. A few examples. Strong customer service levels have been restored in our Americas and RX businesses and are once north of 90%. 
Our new products program is beginning to yield higher results, especially in Europe behind the launch of XLS Forte 5 and strong performance by the ACO brand. New products yielded $65 million in consolidated net sales during the quarter. 
Third, we closed on the divestiture of the Animal Health business for $185 million. 
Fourth, we also closed on the acquisition of Ranir, the world's leading store brand oral self-care company, and raised guidance to reflect the incremental business. Ranir will have a very positive effect on our consolidated results in the second half of the year. 
We also completed the roadmap of our $100 million Project Momentum cost savings initiative. We'll share specific plans and the follow on, on this plan, which is crucial to offset the stranded cost resulting from the eventual separation of our RX business. 
And finally, we've incrementally improved our forecast accuracy, as evidenced, by making this quarter's adjusted EPS results, marking our third consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding analyst expectations. 
The most important is that I feel the excitement building among our employees throughout Perrigo. Like me, they believe that the company is getting back on track. I'm delighted to see throughout the company a commitment to our new self-care vision and the priorities necessary to make that vision a reality. Transformations don't happen without commitment to a shared vision, and we have it. 
This excitement and energy is beginning to show itself in business results, which I will briefly discuss. Our CFO, Ray Silcock will provide the specific GAAP and adjusted results, which you can also see reconciled in the earnings release. But I will be speaking to the adjusted results. 
Adjusted net sales grew 1% for Perrigo on a consolidated basis, excluding Animal Health, infant foods and currency. 
Consumer Self-Care Americas adjusted net sales also increased almost 1% for the quarter, excluding Animal Health and infant foods, driven by a very strong quarter for our core OTC business. 
Perrigo OTC sales, which represents approximately 80% of the Americas business, increased a robust 4% for the quarter and volume increased nearly 6%, tracing to an increase in category demand associated with an extended cough cold season, a good start to the allergy season and strength in our smoking cessation and GI categories. For a perspective, OTC category growth, consumption that is, rate tripled during the quarter versus a year ago from 1.1% to 3.5%. Store brand outpaced that growth, increasing 3.8%, meaning store brand's once again gained share from national brands. 
I wasn't happy with the performance of our infant formula business for the quarter, which declined almost 15% versus a year ago. The mass -- the vast majority of that decline was driven by our contract sales business, which suffered due to inventory issues among several of our branded customers that made the strategic decision to exit infant formula. The performance was also affected by a product recall at a leading customer. But importantly, consumer demand on our store brand business has returned to near pre-recall levels. So the good news here is that as contract packed inventory is correct, we would expect this business in our total nutrition business to quickly stabilize in the second half. 
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales, excluding currency, declined nearly 2% versus year ago, but the results there are better than they look. We had a short-term hiccup in France associated with the sales force restructuring that was large enough to offset growth on the rest of the International business, that is excluding France and currency, CSCI was up 1%. And remember what I shared with you on Investor Day about our purposeful exit of certain nonstrategic brands representing about 4% of the business last year. Well, that's down to 3% this year already. So when you look at our core branded consumer products portfolio, it grew 3% for the quarter driven by nearly $30 million in new product launches. We believe the CSCI transformation is well underway and are working to resolve the short-term issues in France during the second half of the year. And importantly, in markets with attractive growth, we continue to maintain our market share across Europe, led by our core products. 
Our noncore RX segment continued to also perform well and outperform most generic RX companies posting another quarter of topline net sales growth of more than 3%. 
We continue to see a moderation of downward pricing pressure and the business benefited, like consumer Americas, from improved customer service levels. The RX separation continues to be a strategic priority, and we continue to work on affecting a separation. But uncertainty in the market and generic pharmaceuticals industry, generally, right now requires us to reevaluate timing, so as to optimize value for our shareholders. Be clear, our RX business remains strong, and we believe as relatively modest exposure to the factors affecting the industry right now. We have written this business to growth, and we expect it will deliver attractive cash flow as we work towards separation. We will keep you posted. But again, to be clear, we remain committed to the separation and to transforming Perrigo into a pure play consumer company. 
Looking forward, we have a lot to do. And as I have said before, the transformation will take several years. We are making good progress, and I expect that progress to be more visible through accelerated net sales growth in the second half of the year as we integrate Ranir and we see more of our initiatives come to market. 
I remain excited about what we as a team are doing at Perrigo, and I am confident we will recapture the Perrigo advantage. I know we will make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
And with that I'll turn the call over to Ray."

I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning's press release.

I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning's press release. I should note that there are also some explanatory financial charts on our website for additional clarity. 
Moving now to our second quarter results. Consolidated reported net sales were $1.15 billion in Q2, 3% lower than for the same quarter last year. Consolidated adjusted net sales were 1% higher in Q2 than in the same quarter last year after excluding adverse foreign currency movements, the Animal Health business held for sale in Q2 and then divested at the beginning of Q3, and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. 
Consolidated reported net income for the quarter was $9 million, and reported EPS was $0.07 a share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $117 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.86 a share. 
Total adjustments in the quarter amounted to $108 million. We had $74 million of amortization expense, primarily related to previously acquired intangible assets and a $28 million impairment charge of a certain definite-lived asset in our RX business. 
We also incurred $12 million in restructuring charges, primarily due to the reorganization of our sales force in France as well as an $8 million adjustment for a combination of accounting and operational expenses, primarily related to the planned separation of the RX business, plus $3 million of other smaller adjustments, all partially offset by a $17 million non-GAAP tax adjustment. These adjustments can be found delineated in more detail in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release. 
Our reported effective tax rate was unusually high for this quarter at 67%, driven by the RX impairment charge of $28 million in the quarter that was not tax deductible. Adding this impairment charge back to our adjusted pretax income increased the denominator of the adjusted tax rate formula with no change to tax expense. This was the primary reason for the reduction on our adjusted effective tax rate to 23.1%. 
In Q2, Worldwide Consumer reported net sales of $910 million, 5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Worldwide Consumer adjusted net sales were flat as compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impacts of adverse foreign currency movements, the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. 
Total new product sales of $38 million and strong volume in our core U.S. OTC business were more than offset by lower sales volumes in our International segment.
CSCA reported net sales of $582 million in Q2, down 2.5% from the prior year. Adjusted net sales for Q2 were $559 million, 1% higher than for the same period last year when the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited are excluded. 
Net sales from our market-leading U.S. OTC business increased by more than 4% compared to the same quarter prior year. But these increases were partially offset by lower sales of infant formula. 
International reported net sales of $328 million in the quarter, 8.5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Excluding adverse currency movements, sales were down 1.8% from Q2 last year. Strong new product sales of $30 million were more than offset by the impact of discontinued products, lower sales in certain categories and in France. Lower sales in France were primarily due to a lack of sales coverage there as a realignment of the sales force, part of a number of business optimization initiatives underway in CSCI, as we seek to increase productivity and achieve better profitability, resulted in temporary business disruption.
In realigning the sales force, we offered early retirement packages to help us convince 3 sales forces into 1 to improve efficiency and effectiveness. More French sales employees took early retirement than have been anticipated resulting in a reduction of sales effectiveness in the quarter. We expect this disruption to be remedied by year-end as we hire, train and deploy new sales people. 
When the year-over-year decrease in net sales in France is excluded, in addition to the effect of currency movements, CSCI net sales would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
Moving on to gross profits. In Q2, Worldwide Consumer had adjusted gross profit of $366 million, down $42 million from the same quarter last year. Excluding businesses held for sale and adjusting for the impact of currency, second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 3% from Q2 last year. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit was a $190 million, down 10.7% compared to the same quarter last year. This decline was principally due to lower infant formula contract manufacturing as well as operational inefficiencies resulting from higher scrap and some raw materials price inflation. These were partially offset by improved business performance within the U.S. OTC business and by new products introductions. 
Sequentially, compared to our first quarter, Americas adjusted gross profit margin increased 150 basis points to 34%, primarily due to favorable product mix and higher volumes in our OTC category. 
In the International segment, adjusted gross profit was $179 million, down 10.1% compared to the same quarter last year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was down 3.7% compared to prior year, primarily as a result of adverse product mix and the impact from that sales force realignment in France, partially offset by successful new products as we continue to reap the benefits of a healthy new product pipeline. 
Continuing on down to P&L, Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating expenses were flat to last year, excluding the impact of currency and held-for-sale business, adjusted operating expenses were up 8% as a result of: one, 13.5% in R&D investments compared to prior year; two, performance-based compensation plan accruals being returned to 100%; and three, the absence of a onetime insurance recovery that benefited the second quarter last year. 
Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating income in Q2 amounted to $118 million, down from $161 million last year and adjusted operating margin of 13.3% versus 16.8% in the prior year. 
CSCA's adjusted operating of -- operating margin of 20.3% was down 130 basis points from Q2 last year with lower SG&A expenses being partially offset by increased R&D spending when the $50 million upfront license fee for NASONEX, which was charged to R&D in Q2 last year is excluded. 
Sequentially, the Americas adjusted operating margin was up 200 basis points from prior quarter due to gross profit flow through and lower SG&A expenses. In the International segment, adjusted operating margin was stable at 15.3% versus 15.6% last year and 15.4% in this year's first quarter. 
Turning now to the RX segment. Net sales for the quarter were $239 million, 3.4% higher as compared to prior year. New product sales of $27 million and improved customer service were partially offset by continued, although moderating, downward pricing pressure and by the impact of discontinued products. 
Adjusted gross profit of $100 million in the quarter was $16 million lower than in Q2 last year, primarily due to the continued downward pricing pressure and a less favorable product mix, including higher volumes this year of relatively lower margin authorized generic products. RX adjusted operating income of $66 million was down $13 million compared to last year as the gross margin shortfall was partially offset by lower administrative expenses as compared to the prior year. R&D expenses were at a similar to that of last year. 
In summary, Perrigo consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.86, better than we had expected primarily due to improved business performance by both our Americas OTC business and the RX segment. And also as a result of timing differences versus our expectation in R&D and A&P expenditures that we now anticipate incurring in the second half of the year. 
A quick comment on the balance sheet. Our working capital levels were up in the second quarter as we built inventories in order to address some customer service issues and in anticipation of plant maintenance and other needs. As a result, cash flow from operations was significantly lower than normal in Q2 with cash flow as a percent -- cash flow conversion, that is, as a percent of adjusted net income at 60% for the quarter. 
For the balance of the year, we anticipate the cash flow conversion, including from Ranir, will return to between 90% and 97% of adjusted net income. 
Following the Ranir acquisition, we are planning to refinance our existing term loan with a new $600 million facility, the proceeds of which we will use to repay our existing term loan and reduce the balance on our revolving credit facility. We expect that the refinancing will close by the end of this month, we'll be leverage neutral, and we'll lower interest expense by $2.5 million for the balance of 2019. 
Turning now to guidance for the balance of the current year. Our consolidated adjusted EPS guidance is unchanged for the year in the range of $3.75 to $4.05 a share with net sales in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion. 
Adjusted Worldwide Consumer net sales on a constant currency basis for 2019, excluding exited businesses expected to grow by about 5% versus last year. We anticipate this sales growth being driven primarily by the acquisition of Ranir by better performance in our core U.S. OTC business and by -- and from a strong pipeline of new product launches in International. The RX business continues to perform well in spite of the challenging generic marketplace, we continue to anticipate net sales growth this year as a result of a strong new product pipeline and moderation of the downward pricing pressure on this business. 
Please bear in mind this guidance does not include any impact in 2019 from generic ProAir. Potential upsides for the balance of 2019 are the launch of generic ProAir, which if achieved, could add as much as $0.10 per share per quarter and incremental cost savings from Project Momentum of up to $0.05 a share. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

CBD management, I feel like we have a good group of people that are working on it, led by somebody who brought into the company who I don't know if you've -- I haven't -- you haven't met him yet, but as a person who worked with me at Lorillard, who basically did the same thing and breakthrough technology and something very different in the tobacco industry with vapor products, and was the inventor of Blu e-cigs, and that we eventually bought and went national with first then. He's a very innovative-type person, and he is leading the charge in identifying the way to get into CBD in a Perrigo-like way. I don't want to be the same as everybody else. It's progressing. We have -- I don't just want to prematurely talk about it. But I'm not going to get in it to be 1 of 200 people that are just launching a lotion and a cream. So it has to be -- make sense when you hear about it afterwards. And we'll keep you posted as we go on it. But the management expertise is there for sure because I have set that up as sort of a skunkworks to new products innovation group that doesn't even sit here at Allegan or Dublin. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, our business continues to grow. We continue to book more resources against it, our businesses. We like our relationship with Amazon. We have good margins with them and a good relationship. And as -- well, you saw at the May 9 Investor Day, we have strong double-digit growth in those areas. And we have the same thing internationally. It remains an area of focus, if there is an area I'd like to do better on is to see it more than just e-commerce, but I'd like -- digital is more than e-commerce. So we're -- I'm pushing from a consumer perspective that we grow that even further. 
And then Ray, you want to handle the progression on gross margin on RX?"

I am evaluating options that are creative and  remember what -- for this spin I need to create as much value as I possibly can and put -- send off a very healthy RX business, if it's a spinner itself. But if it were to be a spin, it has to be very healthy and so does the remain code, and that it has to be able to execute on those strategic plans. There is lots of options to do that. And one of those options is simply to slowdown a little bit and collect a very stable cash flow. And I feel good about the way that business has stabilized and the new product pipeline that's come to fruition that was a little dry a year ago. And I think you felt it, the company was nongeneric ProAir, that didn't happen. But it expected it to happen a year ago, and has now -- I'm getting the benefit of the pipeline that was supposed to come behind it is now coming to the marketplace and there is more behind that. So I don't see a gap in the company's ability to compete, and the pricing at least for now feels like it has -- the downward pricing pressure is not nearly to the extent it was on our business, which admittedly is pretty differentiated versus others. 
On the customer service, I tried to get some metrics in there. We are -- I'm really pleased with the work that's going, although it's a bit manual. So we have strategically built the inventories, which cost us some working capital during the quarter, as Ray referred to, and got ourselves back to good customer service levels in the 90s, which was -- we were in the low -- we were in the mid-70s when I joined the company. So the important part there is the conversations in our customers' offices are no longer just why -- what's going on the service, what's going on with service. We're back to having conversations on building the business and new products and incremental opportunities and partnerships and all the things we're supposed to be doing instead of covering for -- and explaining why we're not doing the most basic thing we're supposed to do well. So I like that. I like to not have that increased inventory be permanent. So there's a lot of work underway to systematize and with systems and process that we're making great progress on to be more nimble and the able to keep those service levels without the extra working capital."

In the second half of the year, we're looking for a little stronger organically even without Ranir. But you're -- we're looking at 5-plus percent growth in the second half of the year when you count Ranir in there and a stronger performance. And by the way, we had it in the first have, too.

I don't really want to use this call, but I hear the question of giving more detail on the future on Ranir. But Ranir as in -- as their historic algorithm, they've been growing in high single digits, low double digit growth for years. And that's been a combination of both organic and smaller bolt-on acquisitions for those, they're kind of the same formula that we are. And I -- the percent that comes from me each, I expect that business to continue to grow this year. We've given you that within our guidance. And that's from both a combination of continuing to grow at exscind customers, broadening their new product profile -- portfolio, we're expanding internationally, about 30% of that business is international. They continue to have a robust program that, again, I talked about on Investor Day. But I love the way they're focused on not just national brand equivalent, but national brand better and national brand different. And in the future, as it goes forward, this opens up a whole leg of growth for us, both organically and inorganically with additional bolt on there as well, which is all part of the idea. As it relates to our core business, I gave you opportunities -- despite the tough quarter, I believe nutrition is a big opportunity for this company. And we're to narrowing our focus, I think nicotine cessation has been too focused and too tiny, and that's why I said that we had signed the technology agreement and develop -- codevelopment agreement on how we could use sort of the responsibility of Perrigo to work with the FDA to solve some of the problems in tobacco, or bring solutions to smokers wanting to quit in a form that they like, that the FDA can get behind. And that'll take work, those aren't easy things to do, but I believe that nicotine cessation is less than a couple of percent of the total tobacco industry numbers with the entire consumer base willing to quit. So it's got to be an opportunity for us. And international, the weight loss e-commerce, there is just -- I think we've illustrated $0.5 billion of new products that we have put into the pipeline. So we'll keep you posted as we go forward, and I think I left down naturals as another area. But there's a lacking of opportunities. There has to the strong discipline. And I continue, I'm a process guy and I push the organization hard. And as an example, at this Board meeting we had done the Ranir, but we -- I got approval to a comprehensive M&A strategy going forward that laid out the priorities and the funnels that we could go out and do these kinds of bolt-ons, but with real discipline that create shareholder value."

As it relates to a project momentum, the first phase of project momentum when I stood up at May 9, I had confidence at our first cut at it, to believe from an overhead reduction that I could get to the $100 million number. Now I have complete line of sight and probably to a little bit more recognizing you don't get everything, but I'm comfortable with that number. I'm not really expecting much of any of it in 2019, we'll come in the fall and layout the actual plan as we're laying out the execution now. But I expect it to affect 2020 numbers and 2021 numbers. And the difference in the short term versus the long term is some of them require systems to be put into place, as for an example, you'd start it already to talk about CSCI, but you have literally an omega, there were almost 35-something-plus operating systems across there. So there's a whole lot of manual labor to consolidate all of that. And it'll take systems work and investment to accomplish that and that takes a bit longer. But I really like is the back half of your question, is that it? And the answer is no. This first phase was that we're focused on, on the next 1.5 year was overhead related. So operating expenses, cost of products sold or manufacturing, et cetera. So Phase II for us, which we're just entering, and I have no idea the size of that number as I sit here today is to begin to do the work in that area. And I believe there should be meaningful opportunities. This is very complex organization with 14,000 SKUs and all that. So we'll begin the work on SKU optimization. And manufacturing configuration and distribution configuration, but that wasn't part of the initial phase. Ray you want to enter the sort of the economics of the ProAir?"

For the most part, I'm pleased with the second quarter results, and importantly, I like the direction Perrigo is heading. 
Since we shared our strategic direction at May 9 Investor Day, and even before then, we've been moving quickly to execute on the 40 major initiatives we discussed. Initiatives that must happen if we are to successfully transform Perrigo from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. While we are still in the early stages, significant progress was made during the second quarter. A few examples. Strong customer service levels have been restored in our Americas and RX businesses and are once north of 90%. 
Our new products program is beginning to yield higher results, especially in Europe behind the launch of XLS Forte 5 and strong performance by the ACO brand. New products yielded $65 million in consolidated net sales during the quarter. 
Third, we closed on the divestiture of the Animal Health business for $185 million. 
Fourth, we also closed on the acquisition of Ranir, the world's leading store brand oral self-care company, and raised guidance to reflect the incremental business. Ranir will have a very positive effect on our consolidated results in the second half of the year. 
We also completed the roadmap of our $100 million Project Momentum cost savings initiative. We'll share specific plans and the follow on, on this plan, which is crucial to offset the stranded cost resulting from the eventual separation of our RX business. 
And finally, we've incrementally improved our forecast accuracy, as evidenced, by making this quarter's adjusted EPS results, marking our third consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding analyst expectations. 
The most important is that I feel the excitement building among our employees throughout Perrigo. Like me, they believe that the company is getting back on track. I'm delighted to see throughout the company a commitment to our new self-care vision and the priorities necessary to make that vision a reality. Transformations don't happen without commitment to a shared vision, and we have it. 
This excitement and energy is beginning to show itself in business results, which I will briefly discuss. Our CFO, Ray Silcock will provide the specific GAAP and adjusted results, which you can also see reconciled in the earnings release. But I will be speaking to the adjusted results. 
Adjusted net sales grew 1% for Perrigo on a consolidated basis, excluding Animal Health, infant foods and currency. 
Consumer Self-Care Americas adjusted net sales also increased almost 1% for the quarter, excluding Animal Health and infant foods, driven by a very strong quarter for our core OTC business. 
Perrigo OTC sales, which represents approximately 80% of the Americas business, increased a robust 4% for the quarter and volume increased nearly 6%, tracing to an increase in category demand associated with an extended cough cold season, a good start to the allergy season and strength in our smoking cessation and GI categories. For a perspective, OTC category growth, consumption that is, rate tripled during the quarter versus a year ago from 1.1% to 3.5%. Store brand outpaced that growth, increasing 3.8%, meaning store brand's once again gained share from national brands. 
I wasn't happy with the performance of our infant formula business for the quarter, which declined almost 15% versus a year ago. The mass -- the vast majority of that decline was driven by our contract sales business, which suffered due to inventory issues among several of our branded customers that made the strategic decision to exit infant formula. The performance was also affected by a product recall at a leading customer. But importantly, consumer demand on our store brand business has returned to near pre-recall levels. So the good news here is that as contract packed inventory is correct, we would expect this business in our total nutrition business to quickly stabilize in the second half. 
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales, excluding currency, declined nearly 2% versus year ago, but the results there are better than they look. We had a short-term hiccup in France associated with the sales force restructuring that was large enough to offset growth on the rest of the International business, that is excluding France and currency, CSCI was up 1%. And remember what I shared with you on Investor Day about our purposeful exit of certain nonstrategic brands representing about 4% of the business last year. Well, that's down to 3% this year already. So when you look at our core branded consumer products portfolio, it grew 3% for the quarter driven by nearly $30 million in new product launches. We believe the CSCI transformation is well underway and are working to resolve the short-term issues in France during the second half of the year. And importantly, in markets with attractive growth, we continue to maintain our market share across Europe, led by our core products. 
Our noncore RX segment continued to also perform well and outperform most generic RX companies posting another quarter of topline net sales growth of more than 3%. 
We continue to see a moderation of downward pricing pressure and the business benefited, like consumer Americas, from improved customer service levels. The RX separation continues to be a strategic priority, and we continue to work on affecting a separation. But uncertainty in the market and generic pharmaceuticals industry, generally, right now requires us to reevaluate timing, so as to optimize value for our shareholders. Be clear, our RX business remains strong, and we believe as relatively modest exposure to the factors affecting the industry right now. We have written this business to growth, and we expect it will deliver attractive cash flow as we work towards separation. We will keep you posted. But again, to be clear, we remain committed to the separation and to transforming Perrigo into a pure play consumer company. 
Looking forward, we have a lot to do. And as I have said before, the transformation will take several years. We are making good progress, and I expect that progress to be more visible through accelerated net sales growth in the second half of the year as we integrate Ranir and we see more of our initiatives come to market. 
I remain excited about what we as a team are doing at Perrigo, and I am confident we will recapture the Perrigo advantage. I know we will make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
And with that I'll turn the call over to Ray."

I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning's press release. I should note that there are also some explanatory financial charts on our website for ad",1702,"Thank you, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning's press release. I should note that there are also some explanatory financial charts on our website for additional clarity. 
Moving now to our second quarter results. Consolidated reported net sales were $1.15 billion in Q2, 3% lower than for the same quarter last year. Consolidated adjusted net sales were 1% higher in Q2 than in the same quarter last year after excluding adverse foreign currency movements, the Animal Health business held for sale in Q2 and then divested at the beginning of Q3, and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. 
Consolidated reported net income for the quarter was $9 million, and reported EPS was $0.07 a share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $117 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.86 a share. 
Total adjustments in the quarter amounted to $108 million. We had $74 million of amortization expense, primarily related to previously acquired intangible assets and a $28 million impairment charge of a certain definite-lived asset in our RX business. 
We also incurred $12 million in restructuring charges, primarily due to the reorganization of our sales force in France as well as an $8 million adjustment for a combination of accounting and operational expenses, primarily related to the planned separation of the RX business, plus $3 million of other smaller adjustments, all partially offset by a $17 million non-GAAP tax adjustment. These adjustments can be found delineated in more detail in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release. 
Our reported effective tax rate was unusually high for this quarter at 67%, driven by the RX impairment charge of $28 million in the quarter that was not tax deductible. Adding this impairment charge back to our adjusted pretax income increased the denominator of the adjusted tax rate formula with no change to tax expense. This was the primary reason for the reduction on our adjusted effective tax rate to 23.1%. 
In Q2, Worldwide Consumer reported net sales of $910 million, 5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Worldwide Consumer adjusted net sales were flat as compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impacts of adverse foreign currency movements, the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. 
Total new product sales of $38 million and strong volume in our core U.S. OTC business were more than offset by lower sales volumes in our International segment.
CSCA reported net sales of $582 million in Q2, down 2.5% from the prior year. Adjusted net sales for Q2 were $559 million, 1% higher than for the same period last year when the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited are excluded. 
Net sales from our market-leading U.S. OTC business increased by more than 4% compared to the same quarter prior year. But these increases were partially offset by lower sales of infant formula. 
International reported net sales of $328 million in the quarter, 8.5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Excluding adverse currency movements, sales were down 1.8% from Q2 last year. Strong new product sales of $30 million were more than offset by the impact of discontinued products, lower sales in certain categories and in France. Lower sales in France were primarily due to a lack of sales coverage there as a realignment of the sales force, part of a number of business optimization initiatives underway in CSCI, as we seek to increase productivity and achieve better profitability, resulted in temporary business disruption.
In realigning the sales force, we offered early retirement packages to help us convince 3 sales forces into 1 to improve efficiency and effectiveness. More French sales employees took early retirement than have been anticipated resulting in a reduction of sales effectiveness in the quarter. We expect this disruption to be remedied by year-end as we hire, train and deploy new sales people. 
When the year-over-year decrease in net sales in France is excluded, in addition to the effect of currency movements, CSCI net sales would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
Moving on to gross profits. In Q2, Worldwide Consumer had adjusted gross profit of $366 million, down $42 million from the same quarter last year. Excluding businesses held for sale and adjusting for the impact of currency, second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 3% from Q2 last year. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit was a $190 million, down 10.7% compared to the same quarter last year. This decline was principally due to lower infant formula contract manufacturing as well as operational inefficiencies resulting from higher scrap and some raw materials price inflation. These were partially offset by improved business performance within the U.S. OTC business and by new products introductions. 
Sequentially, compared to our first quarter, Americas adjusted gross profit margin increased 150 basis points to 34%, primarily due to favorable product mix and higher volumes in our OTC category. 
In the International segment, adjusted gross profit was $179 million, down 10.1% compared to the same quarter last year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was down 3.7% compared to prior year, primarily as a result of adverse product mix and the impact from that sales force realignment in France, partially offset by successful new products as we continue to reap the benefits of a healthy new product pipeline. 
Continuing on down to P&L, Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating expenses were flat to last year, excluding the impact of currency and held-for-sale business, adjusted operating expenses were up 8% as a result of: one, 13.5% in R&D investments compared to prior year; two, performance-based compensation plan accruals being returned to 100%; and three, the absence of a onetime insurance recovery that benefited the second quarter last year. 
Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating income in Q2 amounted to $118 million, down from $161 million last year and adjusted operating margin of 13.3% versus 16.8% in the prior year. 
CSCA's adjusted operating of -- operating margin of 20.3% was down 130 basis points from Q2 last year with lower SG&A expenses being partially offset by increased R&D spending when the $50 million upfront license fee for NASONEX, which was charged to R&D in Q2 last year is excluded. 
Sequentially, the Americas adjusted operating margin was up 200 basis points from prior quarter due to gross profit flow through and lower SG&A expenses. In the International segment, adjusted operating margin was stable at 15.3% versus 15.6% last year and 15.4% in this year's first quarter. 
Turning now to the RX segment. Net sales for the quarter were $239 million, 3.4% higher as compared to prior year. New product sales of $27 million and improved customer service were partially offset by continued, although moderating, downward pricing pressure and by the impact of discontinued products. 
Adjusted gross profit of $100 million in the quarter was $16 million lower than in Q2 last year, primarily due to the continued downward pricing pressure and a less favorable product mix, including higher volumes this year of relatively lower margin authorized generic products. RX adjusted operating income of $66 million was down $13 million compared to last year as the gross margin shortfall was partially offset by lower administrative expenses as compared to the prior year. R&D expenses were at a similar to that of last year. 
In summary, Perrigo consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.86, better than we had expected primarily due to improved business performance by both our Americas OTC business and the RX segment. And also as a result of timing differences versus our expectation in R&D and A&P expenditures that we now anticipate incurring in the second half of the year. 
A quick comment on the balance sheet. Our working capital levels were up in the second quarter as we built inventories in order to address some customer service issues and in anticipation of plant maintenance and other needs. As a result, cash flow from operations was significantly lower than normal in Q2 with cash flow as a percent -- cash flow conversion, that is, as a percent of adjusted net income at 60% for the quarter. 
For the balance of the year, we anticipate the cash flow conversion, including from Ranir, will return to between 90% and 97% of adjusted net income. 
Following the Ranir acquisition, we are planning to refinance our existing term loan with a new $600 million facility, the proceeds of which we will use to repay our existing term loan and reduce the balance on our revolving credit facility. We expect that the refinancing will close by the end of this month, we'll be leverage neutral, and we'll lower interest expense by $2.5 million for the balance of 2019. 
Turning now to guidance for the balance of the current year. Our consolidated adjusted EPS guidance is unchanged for the year in the range of $3.75 to $4.05 a share with net sales in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion. 
Adjusted Worldwide Consumer net sales on a constant currency basis for 2019, excluding exited businesses expected to grow by about 5% versus last year. We anticipate this sales growth being driven primarily by the acquisition of Ranir by better performance in our core U.S. OTC business and by -- and from a strong pipeline of new product launches in International. The RX business continues to perform well in spite of the challenging generic marketplace, we continue to anticipate net sales growth this year as a result of a strong new product pipeline and moderation of the downward pricing pressure on this business. 
Please bear in mind this guidance does not include any impact in 2019 from generic ProAir. Potential upsides for the balance of 2019 are the launch of generic ProAir, which if achieved, could add as much as $0.10 per share per quarter and incremental cost savings from Project Momentum of up to $0.05 a share. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

It would take some time ramp up the new product program. So everything is on track. I like what I see in the pipeline and the development of bigger initiatives, and that will ramp over time, and we'll continue to do bolt-ons to do that. It plays to a total number that I've given you that I think I get 1% to 2% organic growth from the core business, and then bolt-ons get me up to the 3 and my 3.57 algorithm that I'm working towards to meet the results of consumer peers. As it relates to the spin, it's still an option on the table, we're just as committed as we always are. But this is a business that's a good business, it's differentiated, that doesn't have the same exposure as others and this is a challenging time to be separating. So I -- we need to do it because it's the right thing to do. And I believe we have a little bit of time as the business has stabilized, and I need to get the consumer business performing to where it deserves rerate anyway. And I'm going to maximize shareholder value. So we're still committed to it. I think we spent north of $5 million in the quarter in getting ready and continuing the activities. So we're not backed off. But I have to be aware of what's going on in the marketplace."

He's a very innovative-type person, and he is leading the charge in identifying the way to get into CBD in a Perrigo-like way. I don't want to be the same as everybody else. It's progressing.

But the management expertise is there for sure because I have set that up as sort of a skunkworks to new products innovation group that doesn't even sit here at Allegan or Dublin. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, our business continues to grow. We continue to book more resources against it, our businesses. We like our relationship with Amazon. We have good margins with them and a good relationship. And as -- well, you saw at the May 9 Investor Day, we have strong double-digit growth in those areas. And we have the same thing internationally. It remains an area of focus, if there is an area I'd like to do better on is to see it more than just e-commerce, but I'd like -- digital is more than e-commerce. So we're -- I'm pushing from a consumer perspective that we grow that even further.

The first one on RX, it's not an either/or it's -- the answer to that is yes to both of those. I am evaluating options that are creative and  remember what -- for this spin I need to create as much value as I possibly can and put -- send off a very healthy RX business, if it's a spinner itself. But if it were to be a spin, it has to be very healthy and so does the remain code, and that it has to be able to execute on those strategic plans. There is lots of options to do that. And one of those options is simply to slowdown a little bit and collect a very stable cash flow. And I feel good about the way that business has stabilized and the new product pipeline that's come to fruition that was a little dry a year ago. And I think you felt it, the company was nongeneric ProAir, that didn't happen. But it expected it to happen a year ago, and has now -- I'm getting the benefit of the pipeline that was supposed to come behind it is now coming to the marketplace and there is more behind that. So I don't see a gap in the company's ability to compete, and the pricing at least for now feels like it has -- the downward pricing pressure is not nearly to the extent it was on our business, which admittedly is pretty differentiated versus others. 
On the customer service, I tried to get some metrics in there. We are -- I'm really pleased with the work that's going, although it's a bit manual. So we have strategically built the inventories, which cost us some working capital during the quarter, as Ray referred to, and got ourselves back to good customer service levels in the 90s, which was -- we were in the low -- we were in the mid-70s when I joined the company. So the important part there is the conversations in our customers' offices are no longer just why -- what's going on the service, what's going on with service. We're back to having conversations on building the business and new products and incremental opportunities and partnerships and all the things we're supposed to be doing instead of covering for -- and explaining why we're not doing the most basic thing we're supposed to do well. So I like that. I like to not have that increased inventory be permanent. So there's a lot of work underway to systematize and with systems and process that we're making great progress on to be more nimble and the able to keep those service levels without the extra working capital."

And so I would expect Ranir after the incremental -- just putting pro forma into the business, it's growing at a faster rate to be an example of help accelerating the ongoing rate 2% to 3%. So that'll improve our organic performance. But that's exactly what I said -- and the way -- frankly the way, if you sort of take out all these distractions that Animal Health has there and other, the way the business has been performing. 
In the second half of the year, we're looking for a little stronger organically even without Ranir. But you're -- we're looking at 5-plus percent growth in the second half of the year when you count Ranir in there and a stronger performance. And by the way, we had it in the first have, too. It's just -- it's a complex business, I'm getting my hands around it. But infant formula the play -- like we would have had a gang buster quarter if infant formula was just flat. I mean the category tripling and then extended cost currently to 4% is -- and 6% fine is big numbers for us in the store brand core business."

I don't really want to use this call, but I hear the question of giving more detail on the future on Ranir. But Ranir as in -- as their historic algorithm, they've been growing in high single digits, low double digit growth for years. And that's been a combination of both organic and smaller bolt-on acquisitions for those, they're kind of the same formula that we are. And I -- the percent that comes from me each, I expect that business to continue to grow this year. We've given you that within our guidance. And that's from both a combination of continuing to grow at exscind customers, broadening their new product profile -- portfolio, we're expanding internationally, about 30% of that business is international. They continue to have a robust program that, again, I talked about on Investor Day. But I love the way they're focused on not just national brand equivalent, but national brand better and national brand different. And in the future, as it goes forward, this opens up a whole leg of growth for us, both organically and inorganically with additional bolt on there as well, which is all part of the idea. As it relates to our core business, I gave you opportunities -- despite the tough quarter, I believe nutrition is a big opportunity for this company. And we're to narrowing our focus, I think nicotine cessation has been too focused and too tiny, and that's why I said that we had signed the technology agreement and develop -- codevelopment agreement on how we could use sort of the responsibility of Perrigo to work with the FDA to solve some of the problems in tobacco, or bring solutions to smokers wanting to quit in a form that they like, that the FDA can get behind. And that'll take work, those aren't easy things to do, but I believe that nicotine cessation is less than a couple of percent of the total tobacco industry numbers with the entire consumer base willing to quit. So it's got to be an opportunity for us. And international, the weight loss e-commerce, there is just -- I think we've illustrated $0.5 billion of new products that we have put into the pipeline. So we'll keep you posted as we go forward, and I think I left down naturals as another area. But there's a lacking of opportunities. There has to the strong discipline. And I continue, I'm a process guy and I push the organization hard. And as an example, at this Board meeting we had done the Ranir, but we -- I got approval to a comprehensive M&A strategy going forward that laid out the priorities and the funnels that we could go out and do these kinds of bolt-ons, but with real discipline that create shareholder value."

The regulatory teams -- you can talk to the numbers in a minute, Ray. We believe we have an approvable product right now and there is -- hopefully it could be tomorrow. We believe we're close. As it relates to a project momentum, the first phase of project momentum when I stood up at May 9, I had confidence at our first cut at it, to believe from an overhead reduction that I could get to the $100 million number. Now I have complete line of sight and probably to a little bit more recognizing you don't get everything, but I'm comfortable with that number. I'm not really expecting much of any of it in 2019, we'll come in the fall and layout the actual plan as we're laying out the execution now. But I expect it to affect 2020 numbers and 2021 numbers. And the difference in the short term versus the long term is some of them require systems to be put into place, as for an example, you'd start it already to talk about CSCI, but you have literally an omega, there were almost 35-something-plus operating systems across there. So there's a whole lot of manual labor to consolidate all of that. And it'll take systems work and investment to accomplish that and that takes a bit longer. But I really like is the back half of your question, is that it? And the answer is no. This first phase was that we're focused on, on the next 1.5 year was overhead related. So operating expenses, cost of products sold or manufacturing, et cetera. So Phase II for us, which we're just entering, and I have no idea the size of that number as I sit here today is to begin to do the work in that area. And I believe there should be meaningful opportunities. This is very complex organization with 14,000 SKUs and all that. So we'll begin the work on SKU optimization. And manufacturing configuration and distribution configuration, but that wasn't part of the initial phase. Ray you want to enter the sort of the economics of the ProAir?"

Since we shared our strategic direction at our May 9 Investor Day, and even before then, we've been moving",1086,"Good morning, everyone. For the most part, I'm pleased with the second quarter results, and importantly, I like the direction Perrigo is heading. 
Since we shared our strategic direction at our May 9 Investor Day, and even before then, we've been moving quickly to execute on the 40 major initiatives we discussed. Initiatives that must happen if we are to successfully transform Perrigo from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. While we are still in the early stages, significant progress was made during the second quarter. A few examples. Strong customer service levels have been restored in our Americas and RX businesses and are once north of 90%. 
Our new products program is beginning to yield higher results, especially in Europe behind the launch of XLS Forte 5 and strong performance by the ACO brand. New products yielded $65 million in consolidated net sales during the quarter. 
Third, we closed on the divestiture of the Animal Health business for $185 million. 
Fourth, we also closed on the acquisition of Ranir, the world's leading store brand oral self-care company, and raised guidance to reflect the incremental business. Ranir will have a very positive effect on our consolidated results in the second half of the year. 
We also completed the roadmap of our $100 million Project Momentum cost savings initiative. We'll share specific plans in the fall on, on this plan, which is crucial to offset the stranded costs resulting from the eventual separation of our RX business. 
And finally, we've incrementally improved our forecast accuracy, as evidenced, by making this quarter's adjusted EPS results, marking our third consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding analyst expectations. 
But most important is that I feel the excitement building among our employees throughout Perrigo. Like me, they believe that the company is getting back on track. I'm delighted to see throughout the company a commitment to our new self-care vision and to the priorities necessary to make that vision a reality. Transformations don't happen without commitment to a shared vision, and we have it. 
This excitement and energy is beginning to show itself in business results, which I will briefly discuss. Our CFO, Ray Silcock will provide you the specific GAAP and adjusted results, which you can also see reconciled in the earnings release. But I will be speaking to the adjusted results. 
Adjusted net sales grew 1% for Perrigo on a consolidated basis, excluding Animal Health, infant foods and currency. 
Consumer Self-Care Americas adjusted net sales also increased almost 1% for the quarter, excluding Animal Health and infant foods, driven by a very strong quarter for our core OTC business. 
Perrigo OTC sales, which represents approximately 80% of the Americas business, increased a robust 4% for the quarter and volume increased nearly 6%, tracing to an increase in category demand associated with an extended cough/cold season, a good start to the allergy season and strength in our smoking cessation and GI categories. For a perspective, OTC category growth, consumption that is, rate tripled during the quarter versus a year ago from 1.1% to 3.5%. Store brand outpaced that growth, increasing 3.8%, meaning store brands once again gained share from national brands. 
I wasn't happy with the performance of our infant formula business for the quarter, which declined almost 15% versus a year ago. The mass -- the vast majority of that decline was driven by our contract sales business, which suffered due to inventory issues among several of our branded customers that made the strategic decision to exit infant formula. The performance was also affected by a product recall at a leading customer. But importantly, consumer demand on our store brand business has returned to near pre-recall levels. So the good news here is that as contract packed inventories correct, we would expect this business and our total nutrition business to quickly stabilize in the second half. 
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales, excluding currency, declined nearly 2% versus year ago, but the results there are better than they look. We had a short-term hiccup in France associated with a sales force restructuring that was large enough to offset growth on the rest of the International business, that is excluding France and currency, CSCI was up 1%. And remember what I shared with you on Investor Day about our purposeful exit of certain nonstrategic brands representing about 4% of the business last year. Well, that's down to 3% this year already. So when you look at our core branded consumer products portfolio, it grew 3% for the quarter driven by nearly $30 million in new product launches. We believe the CSCI transformation is well underway and are working to resolve the short-term issues in France during the second half of the year. And importantly, in markets with attractive growth, we continue to maintain our market share across Europe, led by our core products. 
Our noncore RX segment continued to also perform well and outperform most generic RX companies posting another quarter of topline net sales growth of more than 3%. 
We continue to see a moderation of downward pricing pressure and the business benefited, like consumer Americas, from improved customer service levels. The RX separation continues to be a strategic priority, and we continue to work on effecting a separation. But uncertainty in the market and generic pharmaceutical industry, generally, right now requires us to reevaluate timing, so as to optimize value for our shareholders. Be clear, our RX business remains strong, and we believe has relatively modest exposure to the factors affecting the industry right now. We have returned this business to growth, and we expect it will deliver attractive cash flow as we work towards separation. We will keep you posted. But again, to be clear, we remain committed to the separation and to transforming Perrigo into a pure play consumer company. 
Looking forward, we have a lot to do. And as I have said before, the transformation will take several years. We are making good progress, and I expect that progress to be more visible through accelerated net sales growth in the second half of the year as we integrate Ranir and we see more of our initiatives come to market. 
I remain excited about what we as a team are doing at Perrigo, and I am confident we will recapture the Perrigo advantage. I know we will make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
And with that I'll turn the call over to Ray."

I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning's press release. I should note that there are also some explanatory financial charts on our website for additional clarity. 
Moving now to our second quarter results. Consolidated reported net sales were $1.15 billion in Q2, 3% lower than for the same quarter last year. Consolidated adjusted net sales were 1% higher in Q2 than in the same quarter last year after excluding adverse foreign currency movements, the Animal Health business held for sale in Q2 and then divested at the beginning of Q3, and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. 
Consolidated reported net income for the quarter was $9 million, and reported EPS was $0.07 a share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $117 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.86 a share. 
Total adjustments in the quarter amounted to $108 million. We had $74 million of amortization expense, primarily related to previously acquired intangible assets and a $28 million impairment charge of a certain definite-lived asset in our RX business. 
We also incurred $12 million in restructuring charges, primarily due to the reorganization of our sales force in France as well as an $8 million adjustment for a combination of accounting and operational expenses, primarily related to the planned separation of the RX business, plus $3 million of other smaller adjustments, all partially offset by a $17 million non-GAAP tax adjustment. These adjustments can be found delineated in more detail in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release. 
Our reported effective tax rate was unusually high for this quarter at 67%, driven by the RX impairment charge of $28 million in the quarter that was not tax deductible. Adding this impairment charge back to our adjusted pretax income increased the denominator of the adjusted tax rate formula with no change to tax expense. This was the primary reason for the reduction on our adjusted effective tax rate to 23.1%. 
In Q2, Worldwide Consumer reported net sales of $910 million, 5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Worldwide Consumer adjusted net sales were flat as compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impacts of adverse foreign currency movements, the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. 
Total new product sales of $38 million and strong volume in our core U.S. OTC business were more than offset by lower sales volumes in our International segment.
CSCA reported net sales of $582 million in Q2, down 2.5% from the prior year. Adjusted net sales for Q2 were $559 million, 1% higher than for the same period last year when the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited are excluded. 
Net sales from our market-leading U.S. OTC business increased by more than 4% compared to the same quarter prior year. But these increases were partially offset by lower sales of infant formula. 
International reported net sales of $328 million in the quarter, 8.5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Excluding adverse currency movements, sales were down 1.8% from Q2 last year. Strong new product sales of $30 million were more than offset by the impact of discontinued products, lower sales in certain categories and in France. Lower sales in France were primarily due to a lack of sales coverage there as our realignment of the sales force, part of a number of business optimization initiatives underway in CSCI, as we seek to increase productivity and achieve better profitability, resulted in temporary business disruption.
In realigning the sales force, we offered early retirement packages to help us condense 3 sales forces into 1 to improve efficiency and effectiveness. More French sales employees took early retirement than have been anticipated resulting in a reduction of sales effectiveness in the quarter. We expect this disruption to be remedied by year-end as we hire, train and deploy new sales people. 
When the year-over-year decrease in net sales in France is excluded, in addition to the effect of currency movements, CSCI net sales would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
Moving on to gross profits. In Q2, Worldwide Consumer had adjusted gross profit of $366 million, down $42 million from the same quarter last year. Excluding businesses held for sale and adjusting for the impact of currency, second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 3% from Q2 last year. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit was $190 million, down 10.7% compared to the same quarter last year. This decline was principally due to lower infant formula contract manufacturing as well as operational inefficiencies resulting from higher scrap and some raw material price inflation. These were partially offset by improved business performance within the U.S. OTC business and by new products introductions. 
Sequentially, compared to our first quarter, Americas adjusted gross profit margin increased 150 basis points to 34%, primarily due to favorable product mix and higher volumes in our OTC category. 
In the International segment, adjusted gross profit was $179 million (sic) [ $175 million ] , down 10.1% compared to the same quarter last year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was down 3.7% compared to prior year, primarily as a result of adverse product mix and the impact from that sales force realignment in France, partially offset by successful new products as we continue to reap the benefits of a healthy new product pipeline. 
Continuing on down to P&L, Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating expenses were flat to last year. Excluding the impact of currency and held-for-sale business, adjusted operating expenses were up 8% as a result of: one, a 13.5% increase in R&D investments compared to prior year; two, performance-based compensation plan accruals being returned to 100%; and three, the absence of a onetime insurance recovery that benefited the second quarter last year. 
Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating income in Q2 amounted to $118 million, down from $161 million last year and adjusted operating margin of 13.3% versus 16.8% in the prior year. 
CSCA's adjusted operating of -- operating margin of 20.3% was down 130 basis points from Q2 last year with lower SG&A expenses being partially offset by increased R&D spending when the $50 million upfront license fee for NASONEX, which was charged to R&D in Q2 last year is excluded. 
Sequentially, the Americas adjusted operating margin was up 200 basis points from prior quarter due to gross profit flow through and lower SG&A expenses. In the International segment, adjusted operating margin was stable at 15.3% versus 15.6% last year and 15.4% in this year's first quarter. 
Turning now to the RX segment. Net sales for the quarter were $239 million, 3.4% higher as compared to prior year. New product sales of $27 million and improved customer service were partially offset by continued, although moderating, downward pricing pressure and by the impact of discontinued products. 
Adjusted gross profit of $100 million in the quarter was $16 million lower than in Q2 last year, primarily due to the continued downward pricing pressure and a less favorable product mix, including higher volumes this year of relatively lower margin authorized generic products. RX adjusted operating income of $66 million was down $13 million compared to last year as the gross margin shortfall was partially offset by lower administrative expenses as compared to the prior year. R&D expenses were at a similar level to that of last year. 
In summary, Perrigo consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.86, better than we had expected primarily due to improved business performance by both our Americas OTC business and the RX segment. And also as a result of timing differences versus our expectation in R&D and A&P expenditures that we now anticipate incurring in the second half of the year. 
A quick comment on the balance sheet. Our working capital levels were up in the second quarter as we built inventories in order to address some customer service issues and in anticipation of plant maintenance and other needs. As a result, cash flow from operations was significantly lower than normal in Q2 with cash flow as a percent -- cash flow conversion, that is, as a percent of adjusted net income at 60% for the quarter. 
For the balance of the year, we anticipate the cash flow conversion, including from Ranir, will return to between 90% and 97% of adjusted net income. 
Following the Ranir acquisition, we are planning to refinance our existing term loan with a new $600 million facility, the proceeds of which we will use to repay our existing term loan and reduce the balance on our revolving credit facility. We expect that the refinancing will close by the end of this month, will be leverage neutral, and will lower our interest expense by $2.5 million for the balance of 2019. 
Turning now to guidance for the balance of the current year. Our consolidated adjusted EPS guidance is unchanged for the year in the range of $3.75 to $4.05 a share with net sales in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion. 
Adjusted Worldwide Consumer net sales on a constant currency basis for 2019, excluding exited businesses are expected to grow by about 5% versus last year. We anticipate this sales growth being driven primarily by the acquisition of Ranir, by better performance in our core U.S. OTC business and by -- and from a strong pipeline of new product launches in International. The RX business continues to perform well in spite of the challenging generic marketplace, we continue to anticipate net sales growth this year as a result of a strong new product pipeline and moderation of the downward pricing pressure on this business. 
Please bear in mind this guidance does not include any impact in 2019 from generic ProAir. Potential upsides for the balance of 2019 are the launch of generic ProAir, which if achieved, could add as much as $0.10 per share per quarter and incremental cost savings from Project Momentum of up to $0.05 a share. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

So you're going to see great growth out of CSCA largely in the second half of the year and the beginning of next year from the bolt on of Ranir, which is exactly I told you. It would take some time ramp up the new product program. So everything is on track. I like what I see in the pipeline and the development of bigger initiatives, and that will ramp over time, and we'll continue to do bolt-ons to do that. It plays to a total number that I've given you that I think I get 1% to 2% organic growth from the core business, and then bolt-ons get me up to the 3% and my 3/5/7 algorithm that I'm working towards to meet the results of consumer peers. As it relates to the spin, it's still an option on the table, we're just as committed as we always are. But this is a business that's a good business, it's differentiated, that doesn't have the same exposure as others and this is a challenging time to be separating. So I -- we need to do it because it's the right thing to do. And I believe we have a little bit of time as the business has stabilized, and I need to get the consumer business performing to where it deserves the rerate anyway. And I'm going to maximize shareholder value. So we're still committed to it. I think we spent just -- north of $5 million in the quarter in getting ready and continuing the activities. So we're not backed off. But I have to be aware of what's going on in the marketplace."

Let me make sure I have all -- you had the e-commerce question, CBD management expertise and, Ray, you can -- after I do that, you do the gross margin progression. 
CBD management, I feel like we have a good group of people that are working on it, led by somebody who I brought into the company who I don't know if you've -- I haven't -- you haven't met him yet, but is a person who worked with me at Lorillard, who basically did the same thing in breakthrough technology and something very different in the tobacco industry with vapor products, and was the inventor of Blu e-cigs, and that we eventually bought and went national with first then. He's a very innovative-type person, and he is leading the charge in identifying the way to get into CBD in a Perrigo-like way. I don't want to be the same as everybody else. It's progressing. We have -- I don't just want to prematurely talk about it. But I'm not going to get in it to be 1 of 200 people that are just launching a lotion and a cream. So it has to be -- make sense when you hear about it afterwards. And we'll keep you posted as we go on it. But the management expertise is there for sure because I have set that up as sort of a skunkworks new products innovation group that doesn't even sit here at -- in Allegan or Dublin. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, our business continues to grow. We continue to put more resources against it, our businesses. We like our relationship with Amazon. We have good margins with them and a good relationship. And as -- well, you saw at the May 9 Investor Day, we have strong double-digit growth in those areas. And we have the same thing internationally. It remains an area of focus, if there is an area I'd like to do better on is to see it more than just e-commerce, but I'd like -- digital is more than e-commerce. So we're -- I'm pushing from a consumer perspective that we grow that even further. 
And then Ray, you want to handle the progression on gross margin on RX?"

I am evaluating options that are creative and  remember what -- for this spin I need to create as much value as I possibly can and put -- send off a very healthy RX business, if it's a spin or a sale. But if it would to be a spin, it has to be very healthy and so does the RemainCo, and that has to be able to execute on those strategic plans. There is lots of options to do that. And one of those options is simply to slow down a little bit and collect a very stable cash flow. And I feel good about the way that business has stabilized and the new product pipeline that's come to fruition that was a little dry a year ago. And I think you felt it, the company was [indiscernible] on generic ProAir, that didn't happen. But it expected it to happen a year ago, and has now -- I'm getting the benefit of the pipeline that was supposed to come behind it is now coming to the marketplace and there is more behind that. So I don't see a gap in the company's ability to compete, and the pricing at least for now feels like it has -- the downward pricing pressure is not nearly to the extent it was on our business, which admittedly is pretty differentiated versus others. 
On the customer service, I tried to give some metrics in there. We are -- I'm really pleased with the work that's going, although it's a bit manual. So we have strategically built inventories, which cost us some working capital during the quarter, as Ray referred to, and got ourselves back up to good customer service levels in the 90s, which was -- we were in the low -- we were in the mid-70s when I joined the company. So the important part there is the conversations in our customers' offices are no longer just what -- what's going with the service, what's going on with service. We're back to having conversations on building the business and new products and incremental opportunities and partnerships and all the things that we're supposed to be doing instead of covering for -- and explaining why we're not doing the most basic thing we're supposed to do well. So I like that. I like to not have that increased inventory be permanent. So there's a lot of work underway to systematize and -- and with systems and process, that we're making great progress on to be more nimble and be able to keep those service levels without the extra working capital."

But Ranir has an -- as their historic algorithm, they've been growing in high single digits, low double digit growth for years. And that's been a combination of both organic and smaller bolt-on acquisitions for those, they're kind of the same formula that we are. And I -- the percent that comes from each, I expect that business to continue to grow this year. We've given you that within our guidance. And that's from both a combination of continuing to grow at existing customers, broadening their new product profile -- portfolio, we're expanding internationally, about 30% of that business is international. They continue to have a robust program that, again, I talked about on Investor Day. But I love the way they're focused on not just national brand equivalent, but national brand better and national brand different. And in the future, as it goes forward, this opens up a whole leg of growth for us, both organically and inorganically with additional bolt-ons there as well, which is all part of the idea. As it relates to our core business, I gave you opportunities of -- despite the tougher quarter, I believe nutrition is a big opportunity for this company. And we're too narrowing in our focus. I think nicotine cessation has been too focused and too tiny, and that's why I said that we had signed a technology agreement and develop -- codevelopment agreement on how we could use sort of the responsibility of a Perrigo to work with the FDA to solve some of the problems in tobacco, or bring solutions to smokers wanting to quit in a form that they like, that the FDA can get behind. And that'll take work, those aren't easy things to do, but I believe that nicotine cessation is less than a couple percent of a total tobacco industry number with the entire consumer base wanting to quit. So it's got to be an opportunity for us. And international, the weight loss, e-commerce, there is just -- I think we've illustrated $0.5 billion of new products that we have put into the pipeline. So we'll keep you posted as we go forward, and I think I left out naturals as another area. But there's no lacking of opportunities. There has to strong discipline. And I continue -- I'm a process guy and I push the organization hard. And as an example, at this Board meeting we had done the Ranir, but we -- I got approval to a comprehensive M&A strategy going forward that laid out the priorities and the funnels that we could go out and do these kinds of bolt-ons, but with real discipline that create shareholder value."

As it relates to a Project Momentum, the first phase of Project Momentum when I stood up at May 9, I had confidence at a first cut at it, to believe from an overhead reduction that I could get to the $100 million number. Now I have complete line of sight and probably, too, a little bit more recognizing you don't get everything, but I'm comfortable with that number. I'm not really expecting much of any of it in 2019, we'll come in the fall and lay out the actual plan as we're laying out the execution now. But I expect it to affect 2020 numbers and 2021 numbers. And the difference in the short term versus the long term is some of them require systems to be put into place, as for an example, you've started already to talk about CSCI, but you have literally in Omega, there were most -- 35-something-plus operating systems across there. So there's a whole lot of manual labor to consolidate all of that. And it'll take systems work and investment to accomplish that and that takes a bit longer. What I really liked is the back half of your question, is that it? And the answer is no. This first phase was -- that we're focused on, on the next 1.5 year was overhead related. So operating expenses, not cost of products sold or manufacturing, et cetera. So Phase II for us, which we're just entering, and I have no idea the size of that number as I sit here today, is to begin to do the work in that area. And I believe there should be meaningful opportunities. This is very complex organization with 14,000 SKUs and all that. So we'll begin the work on SKU optimization. And manufacturing configuration and distribution configuration, but that wasn't part of the initial phase. Ray, you want to answer the -- sort of the economics of the ProAir?"

For the most part, I'm pleased with the second quarter results, and importantly, I like the direction Perrigo is heading. 
Since we shared our strategic direction at our May 9 Investor Day, and even before then, we've been moving quickly to execute on the 40 major initiatives we discussed. Initiatives that must happen if we are to successfully transform Perrigo from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. While we are still in the early stages, significant progress was made during the second quarter. A few examples. Strong customer service levels have been restored in our Americas and RX businesses and are once north of 90%. 
Our new products program is beginning to yield higher results, especially in Europe behind the launch of XLS Forte 5 and strong performance by the ACO brand. New products yielded $65 million in consolidated net sales during the quarter. 
Third, we closed on the divestiture of the Animal Health business for $185 million. 
Fourth, we also closed on the acquisition of Ranir, the world's leading store brand oral self-care company, and raised guidance to reflect the incremental business. Ranir will have a very positive effect on our consolidated results in the second half of the year. 
We also completed the roadmap of our $100 million Project Momentum cost savings initiative. We'll share specific plans in the fall on, on this plan, which is crucial to offset the stranded costs resulting from the eventual separation of our RX business. 
And finally, we've incrementally improved our forecast accuracy, as evidenced, by making this quarter's adjusted EPS results, marking our third consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding analyst expectations. 
But most important is that I feel the excitement building among our employees throughout Perrigo. Like me, they believe that the company is getting back on track. I'm delighted to see throughout the company a commitment to our new self-care vision and to the priorities necessary to make that vision a reality. Transformations don't happen without commitment to a shared vision, and we have it. 
This excitement and energy is beginning to show itself in business results, which I will briefly discuss. Our CFO, Ray Silcock will provide you the specific GAAP and adjusted results, which you can also see reconciled in the earnings release. But I will be speaking to the adjusted results. 
Adjusted net sales grew 1% for Perrigo on a consolidated basis, excluding Animal Health, infant foods and currency. 
Consumer Self-Care Americas adjusted net sales also increased almost 1% for the quarter, excluding Animal Health and infant foods, driven by a very strong quarter for our core OTC business. 
Perrigo OTC sales, which represents approximately 80% of the Americas business, increased a robust 4% for the quarter and volume increased nearly 6%, tracing to an increase in category demand associated with an extended cough/cold season, a good start to the allergy season and strength in our smoking cessation and GI categories. For a perspective, OTC category growth, consumption that is, rate tripled during the quarter versus a year ago from 1.1% to 3.5%. Store brand outpaced that growth, increasing 3.8%, meaning store brands once again gained share from national brands. 
I wasn't happy with the performance of our infant formula business for the quarter, which declined almost 15% versus a year ago. The mass -- the vast majority of that decline was driven by our contract sales business, which suffered due to inventory issues among several of our branded customers that made the strategic decision to exit infant formula. The performance was also affected by a product recall at a leading customer. But importantly, consumer demand on our store brand business has returned to near pre-recall levels. So the good news here is that as contract packed inventories correct, we would expect this business and our total nutrition business to quickly stabilize in the second half. 
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales, excluding currency, declined nearly 2% versus year ago, but the results there are better than they look. We had a short-term hiccup in France associated with a sales force restructuring that was large enough to offset growth on the rest of the International business, that is excluding France and currency, CSCI was up 1%. And remember what I shared with you on Investor Day about our purposeful exit of certain nonstrategic brands representing about 4% of the business last year. Well, that's down to 3% this year already. So when you look at our core branded consumer products portfolio, it grew 3% for the quarter driven by nearly $30 million in new product launches. We believe the CSCI transformation is well underway and are working to resolve the short-term issues in France during the second half of the year. And importantly, in markets with attractive growth, we continue to maintain our market share across Europe, led by our core products. 
Our noncore RX segment continued to also perform well and outperform most generic RX companies posting another quarter of topline net sales growth of more than 3%. 
We continue to see a moderation of downward pricing pressure and the business benefited, like consumer Americas, from improved customer service levels. The RX separation continues to be a strategic priority, and we continue to work on effecting a separation. But uncertainty in the market and generic pharmaceutical industry, generally, right now requires us to reevaluate timing, so as to optimize value for our shareholders. Be clear, our RX business remains strong, and we believe has relatively modest exposure to the factors affecting the industry right now. We have returned this business to growth, and we expect it will deliver attractive cash flow as we work towards separation. We will keep you posted. But again, to be clear, we remain committed to the separation and to transforming Perrigo into a pure play consumer company. 
Looking forward, we have a lot to do. And as I have said before, the transformation will take several years. We are making good progress, and I expect that progress to be more visible through accelerated net sales growth in the second half of the year as we integrate Ranir and we see more of our initiatives come to market. 
I remain excited about what we as a team are doing at Perrigo, and I am confident we will recapture the Perrigo advantage. I know we will make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. 
And with that I'll turn the call over to Ray."

I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning's press release.

I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning's press release. I should note that there are also some explanatory financial charts on our website for additional clarity. 
Moving now to our second quarter results. Consolidated reported net sales were $1.15 billion in Q2, 3% lower than for the same quarter last year. Consolidated adjusted net sales were 1% higher in Q2 than in the same quarter last year after excluding adverse foreign currency movements, the Animal Health business held for sale in Q2 and then divested at the beginning of Q3, and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. 
Consolidated reported net income for the quarter was $9 million, and reported EPS was $0.07 a share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $117 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.86 a share. 
Total adjustments in the quarter amounted to $108 million. We had $74 million of amortization expense, primarily related to previously acquired intangible assets and a $28 million impairment charge of a certain definite-lived asset in our RX business. 
We also incurred $12 million in restructuring charges, primarily due to the reorganization of our sales force in France as well as an $8 million adjustment for a combination of accounting and operational expenses, primarily related to the planned separation of the RX business, plus $3 million of other smaller adjustments, all partially offset by a $17 million non-GAAP tax adjustment. These adjustments can be found delineated in more detail in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release. 
Our reported effective tax rate was unusually high for this quarter at 67%, driven by the RX impairment charge of $28 million in the quarter that was not tax deductible. Adding this impairment charge back to our adjusted pretax income increased the denominator of the adjusted tax rate formula with no change to tax expense. This was the primary reason for the reduction on our adjusted effective tax rate to 23.1%. 
In Q2, Worldwide Consumer reported net sales of $910 million, 5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Worldwide Consumer adjusted net sales were flat as compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impacts of adverse foreign currency movements, the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. 
Total new product sales of $38 million and strong volume in our core U.S. OTC business were more than offset by lower sales volumes in our International segment.
CSCA reported net sales of $582 million in Q2, down 2.5% from the prior year. Adjusted net sales for Q2 were $559 million, 1% higher than for the same period last year when the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited are excluded. 
Net sales from our market-leading U.S. OTC business increased by more than 4% compared to the same quarter prior year. But these increases were partially offset by lower sales of infant formula. 
International reported net sales of $328 million in the quarter, 8.5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Excluding adverse currency movements, sales were down 1.8% from Q2 last year. Strong new product sales of $30 million were more than offset by the impact of discontinued products, lower sales in certain categories and in France. Lower sales in France were primarily due to a lack of sales coverage there as our realignment of the sales force, part of a number of business optimization initiatives underway in CSCI, as we seek to increase productivity and achieve better profitability, resulted in temporary business disruption.
In realigning the sales force, we offered early retirement packages to help us condense 3 sales forces into 1 to improve efficiency and effectiveness. More French sales employees took early retirement than have been anticipated resulting in a reduction of sales effectiveness in the quarter. We expect this disruption to be remedied by year-end as we hire, train and deploy new salespeople. 
When the year-over-year decrease in net sales in France is excluded, in addition to the effect of currency movements, CSCI net sales would have grown 1% in the quarter. 
Moving on to gross profits. In Q2, Worldwide Consumer had adjusted gross profit of $366 million, down $42 million from the same quarter last year. Excluding businesses held for sale and adjusting for the impact of currency, second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 3% from Q2 last year. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit was $190 million, down 10.7% compared to the same quarter last year. This decline was principally due to lower infant formula contract manufacturing as well as operational inefficiencies resulting from higher scrap and some raw material price inflation. These were partially offset by improved business performance within the U.S. OTC business and by new products introductions. 
Sequentially, compared to our first quarter, Americas adjusted gross profit margin increased 150 basis points to 34%, primarily due to favorable product mix and higher volumes in our OTC category. 
In the International segment, adjusted gross profit was $179 million (sic) [ $175 million ] , down 10.1% compared to the same quarter last year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was down 3.7% compared to prior year, primarily as a result of adverse product mix and the impact from that salesforce realignment in France, partially offset by successful new products as we continue to reap the benefits of a healthy new product pipeline. 
Continuing on down to P&L, Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating expenses were flat to last year. Excluding the impact of currency and held-for-sale business, adjusted operating expenses were up 8% as a result of: one, a 13.5% increase in R&D investments compared to prior year; two, performance-based compensation plan accruals being returned to 100%; and three, the absence of a onetime insurance recovery that benefited the second quarter last year. 
Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating income in Q2 amounted to $118 million, down from $161 million last year and adjusted operating margin of 13.3% versus 16.8% in the prior year. 
CSCA's adjusted operating of -- operating margin of 20.3% was down 130 basis points from Q2 last year with lower SG&A expenses being partially offset by increased R&D spending when the $50 million upfront license fee for NASONEX, which was charged to R&D in Q2 last year is excluded. 
Sequentially, the Americas adjusted operating margin was up 200 basis points from prior quarter due to gross profit flow-through and lower SG&A expenses. In the International segment, adjusted operating margin was stable at 15.3% versus 15.6% last year and 15.4% in this year's first quarter. 
Turning now to the RX segment. Net sales for the quarter were $239 million, 3.4% higher as compared to prior year. New product sales of $27 million and improved customer service were partially offset by continued, although moderating, downward pricing pressure and by the impact of discontinued products. 
Adjusted gross profit of $100 million in the quarter was $16 million lower than in Q2 last year, primarily due to the continued downward pricing pressure and a less favorable product mix, including higher volumes this year of relatively lower margin authorized generic products. RX adjusted operating income of $66 million was down $13 million compared to last year as the gross margin shortfall was partially offset by lower administrative expenses as compared to the prior year. R&D expenses were at a similar level to that of last year. 
In summary, Perrigo consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.86, better than we had expected primarily due to improved business performance by both our Americas OTC business and the RX segment. And also as a result of timing differences versus our expectation in R&D and A&P expenditures that we now anticipate incurring in the second half of the year. 
A quick comment on the balance sheet. Our working capital levels were up in the second quarter as we built inventories in order to address some customer service issues and in anticipation of plant maintenance and other needs. As a result, cash flow from operations was significantly lower than normal in Q2 with cash flow as a percent -- cash flow conversion, that is, as a percent of adjusted net income at 60% for the quarter. 
For the balance of the year, we anticipate the cash flow conversion, including from Ranir, will return to between 90% and 97% of adjusted net income. 
Following the Ranir acquisition, we are planning to refinance our existing term loan with a new $600 million facility, the proceeds of which we will use to repay our existing term loan and reduce the balance on our revolving credit facility. We expect that the refinancing will close by the end of this month, will be leverage neutral, and will lower our interest expense by $2.5 million for the balance of 2019. 
Turning now to guidance for the balance of the current year. Our consolidated adjusted EPS guidance is unchanged for the year in the range of $3.75 to $4.05 a share with net sales in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion. 
Adjusted Worldwide Consumer net sales on a constant currency basis for 2019, excluding exited businesses are expected to grow by about 5% versus last year. We anticipate this sales growth being driven primarily by the acquisition of Ranir, by better performance in our core U.S. OTC business and by -- and from a strong pipeline of new product launches in International. The RX business continues to perform well in spite of the challenging generic marketplace, we continue to anticipate net sales growth this year as a result of a strong new product pipeline and moderation of the downward pricing pressure on this business. 
Please bear in mind this guidance does not include any impact in 2019 from generic ProAir. Potential upsides for the balance of 2019 are the launch of generic ProAir, which if achieved, could add as much as $0.10 per share per quarter and incremental cost savings from Project Momentum of up to $0.05 a share. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Murray."

As it relates to the spin, it's still an option on the table, we're just as committed as we always are.

He's a very innovative-type person, and he is leading the charge in identifying the way to get into CBD in a Perrigo-like way. I don't want to be the same as everybody else. It's progressing.

But the management expertise is there for sure because I have set that up as sort of a skunkworks new products innovation group that doesn't even sit here at -- in Allegan or Dublin. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, our business continues to grow. We continue to put more resources against it, our businesses. We like our relationship with Amazon. We have good margins with them and a good relationship. And as -- well, you saw at the May 9 Investor Day, we have strong double-digit growth in those areas. And we have the same thing internationally. It remains an area of focus, if there is an area I'd like to do better on is to see it more than just e-commerce, but I'd like -- digital is more than e-commerce. So we're -- I'm pushing from a consumer perspective that we grow that even further.

The first one on RX, it's not an either/or it's -- the answer to that is yes to both of those. I am evaluating options that are creative and  remember what -- for this spin I need to create as much value as I possibly can and put -- send off a very healthy RX business, if it's a spin or a sale. But if it would to be a spin, it has to be very healthy and so does the RemainCo, and that has to be able to execute on those strategic plans. There is lots of options to do that. And one of those options is simply to slow down a little bit and collect a very stable cash flow. And I feel good about the way that business has stabilized and the new product pipeline that's come to fruition that was a little dry a year ago. And I think you felt it, the company was [indiscernible] on generic ProAir, that didn't happen. But it expected it to happen a year ago, and has now -- I'm getting the benefit of the pipeline that was supposed to come behind it is now coming to the marketplace and there is more behind that. So I don't see a gap in the company's ability to compete, and the pricing at least for now feels like it has -- the downward pricing pressure is not nearly to the extent it was on our business, which admittedly is pretty differentiated versus others. 
On the customer service, I tried to give some metrics in there. We are -- I'm really pleased with the work that's going, although it's a bit manual. So we have strategically built inventories, which cost us some working capital during the quarter, as Ray referred to, and got ourselves back up to good customer service levels in the 90s, which was -- we were in the low -- we were in the mid-70s when I joined the company. So the important part there is the conversations in our customers' offices are no longer just what -- what's going with the service, what's going on with service. We're back to having conversations on building the business and new products and incremental opportunities and partnerships and all the things that we're supposed to be doing instead of covering for -- and explaining why we're not doing the most basic thing we're supposed to do well. So I like that. I like to not have that increased inventory be permanent. So there's a lot of work underway to systematize and -- and with systems and process, that we're making great progress on to be more nimble and be able to keep those service levels without the extra working capital."

I don't really want to use this call, but I hear the question of giving more detail on the future on Ranir. But Ranir has an -- as their historic algorithm, they've been growing in high single digits, low double-digit growth for years. And that's been a combination of both organic and smaller bolt-on acquisitions for those, they're kind of the same formula that we are. And I -- the percent that comes from each, I expect that business to continue to grow this year. We've given you that within our guidance. And that's from both a combination of continuing to grow at existing customers, broadening their new product profile -- portfolio, we're expanding internationally, about 30% of that business is international. They continue to have a robust program that, again, I talked about on Investor Day. But I love the way they're focused on not just national brand equivalent, but national brand better and national brand different. And in the future, as it goes forward, this opens up a whole leg of growth for us, both organically and inorganically with additional bolt-ons there as well, which is all part of the idea. As it relates to our core business, I gave you opportunities of -- despite the tougher quarter, I believe nutrition is a big opportunity for this company. And we're too narrowing in our focus. I think nicotine cessation has been too focused and too tiny, and that's why I said that we had signed a technology agreement and develop -- codevelopment agreement on how we could use sort of the responsibility of a Perrigo to work with the FDA to solve some of the problems in tobacco, or bring solutions to smokers wanting to quit in a form that they like, that the FDA can get behind. And that'll take work, those aren't easy things to do, but I believe that nicotine cessation is less than a couple percent of a total tobacco industry number with the entire consumer base wanting to quit. So it's got to be an opportunity for us. And international, the weight loss, e-commerce, there is just -- I think we've illustrated $0.5 billion of new products that we have put into the pipeline. So we'll keep you posted as we go forward, and I think I left out naturals as another area. But there's no lacking of opportunities. There has to strong discipline. And I continue -- I'm a process guy and I push the organization hard. And as an example, at this Board meeting we had done the Ranir, but we -- I got approval to a comprehensive M&A strategy going forward that laid out the priorities and the funnels that we could go out and do these kinds of bolt-ons, but with real discipline that create shareholder value."

The regulatory teams -- you can talk to the numbers in a minute, Ray. We believe we have an approvable product right now and there is -- hopefully, it could be tomorrow. We believe we're close. As it relates to a Project Momentum, the first phase of Project Momentum when I stood up at May 9, I had confidence at a first cut at it, to believe from an overhead reduction that I could get to the $100 million number. Now I have complete line of sight and probably, too, a little bit more recognizing you don't get everything, but I'm comfortable with that number. I'm not really expecting much of any of it in 2019, we'll come in the fall and lay out the actual plan as we're laying out the execution now. But I expect it to affect 2020 numbers and 2021 numbers. And the difference in the short term versus the long term is some of them require systems to be put into place, as for an example, you've started already to talk about CSCI, but you have literally in Omega, there were most -- 35-something-plus operating systems across there. So there's a whole lot of manual labor to consolidate all of that. And it'll take systems work and investment to accomplish that and that takes a bit longer. What I really liked is the back half of your question, is that it? And the answer is no. This first phase was -- that we're focused on, on the next 1.5 year was overhead related. So operating expenses, not cost of products sold or manufacturing, et cetera. So Phase II for us, which we're just entering, and I have no idea the size of that number as I sit here today, is to begin to do the work in that area. And I believe there should be meaningful opportunities. This is very complex organization with 14,000 SKUs and all that. So we'll begin the work on SKU optimization. And manufacturing configuration and distribution configuration, but that wasn't part of the initial phase. Ray, you want to answer the -- sort of the economics of the ProAir?"

I'm pleased with the company's third quarter results. And it's worth noting that this is the first time I said that about a quarter even though this is the fourth quarter and renewal that results were met or exceeded expectations.",757,"Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with the company's third quarter results. And it's worth noting that this is the first time I said that about a quarter even though this is the fourth quarter and renewal that results were met or exceeded expectations. What differentiates this quarter is that our top line is growing again, as many of the initiatives we implemented part of our strategic plan are beginning to take effect. And while a meaningful portion of this quarter's double-digit growth is due to the bolt-on acquisitions of our Ranir, the organic growth results were also solid. Really the company hit all almost all cylinders from a revenue perspective, with one exceptions and the nutrition, which was explained last-quarter and, which will be further detailed in a moment. Cost control also benefited the company's results as we enjoyed overhead savings from Project Momentum. All in all, I like the direction we are headed, we are executing well and I believe we are on track to achieve our stated 357 long-term consumer growth objectives. 
Let me go into a bit more detail. Total Perrigo consolidated net sales grew just over 10% versus year ago. All segments contributed to this growth, including a 9% increase in Consumer Self-Care Americas, at 10% increase in Consumer Self-Care International and a 13% increase and generic RX. CSCA net sales growth of 9% was led by the incremental addition of the U.S. Ranir's sales of $54 million and an increase of 3% or $13 million of organic net sales growth on our ROTC business. From a consumption basis, OTC category growth remained strong growing 2% revenue during the third quarter versus  a year ago according to IRI. For the same period, store brand retail dollars grew 2.8%, outpacing national brand growth of 1.6%, which was a 30 basis points share gain per store brands. OTC share gains were driven by solid growth in our allergy and smoking cessation categories. What most excites me here is beyond the growth is the renewed purpose, with which Perrigo teams are attacking and winning in our core categories. Solid organic OTC growth was partially offset by an 11% decline versus a year ago in our infant nutrition business. The infant nutrition performance during the quarter was as expected and as explained in last quarter's conference call. 
Remember the second quarter ended nutrition results were heard by our contract packing inventory issue and retail disruption from a product recall. Importantly, the retail issue is behind us. As the U.S. store brand infant formula business returned to growth in the third quarter, increasing 4% versus a year ago. And while the contract packed sales inventory issued continued in Q3, it was expected. The good news is we're almost through that issue as well and looking forward we have a strong pipeline of new infant formula products, many of which are launching as we speak, and we have gained distribution at a major new customer. Said another way, we see infant nutrition in total going again versus a year ago in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales increased 10% versus a year ago. While the CSCI results benefited from over $23 million in incremental sales from Ranir, we saw solid organic growth of over 3%. The 3% organic growth in CSCI was driven by $28 million in new product launches and good selling activities for the Costco's season in Europe. 
I'd also note that France, which I highlighted last quarter is well on its way to being corrected as we now have our sales force back up to full strength, and we've a solid pipeline of new products ready to launch early next year.
Finally, our RX segment continued to perform well and outperform most generic RX companies, growing 13% versus a year ago in the quarter. It's worth noting that we did have service issues related to supply to interruption from several of our key suppliers, not meeting their production goals and timelines. 
So in summary, repeat it was a solid quarter, good quality. We still have a lot to do to be able to consistently report this type of growth, but we're heading in the right direction. Perrigo teams across the world are starting to win again and the teams are energized. And of course, we all believe we are recapturing sleep Perrigo advantage and are certain we will make lives better by ringing quality affordable, self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. I'll now turn the call over to Ray."

Now that Murray has gone through the sales highlights for the quarter, I'd like to walk you threw the rest of the Q3 P&L, briefly focused on the balance sheet and provide some color and commentary on our outlook for the rest of 2019. Consolidated reported net income for Q3 was $92 million, and reported diluted EPS was $0.67 per share, which included an $18 million or $0.11 charge for our voluntary retail market recall benefiting, the cost of which was removed from our adjusted net income for the quarter. Consolidated adjusted net income for the quarter was $142 million, and adjusted EPS was at $1.04 per share, up $0.11 from Wall street consensus, third sequential quarterly earnings and fourth sequential quarter of meeting or exceeding market expectations. Adjusted net income includes $50 million of non-GAAP adjustments. We're adding back $81 million of amortization, $18 million related to the acquisition of Ranir, $18 million from the ranitidine recall and $11 million impairment of RX brand and $17 million of restructuring business separation and unusual litigation. 
And then, with subtracting the $72 million gain from the sale of the animal health business together with $31 million in tax impacts from all of these adjustments. Our reported consolidated effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.2%, much lower than in the recent quarters, primarily as a result of the tax loss that arose from the sale of the animal health business, despite the fact that we had a $72 million book gain. Since we exclude that gain from our adjusted results, we have eliminated the associated tax impact as well. This increased Q3 effective tax rate from a GAAP rate of 5.2% to a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.1%. Details of all these adjustments can be found in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release. From this point foreword, all my comments and numbers are on a non-GAAP basis. Moving now to segment reporting. I'm going to start by reviewing the results of our worldwide consumer business, which is comprised of the consumers self-care Americas segment, the Consumer Self-Care International segment and corporate unallocated, followed by the results of the results of the 2 segments individually. 
I'll discuss the RX segment afterwards. Worldwide Consumer adjusted gross profit as compared to last year was up $12 million to $392 million, which amounted to an increase of 9% on a constant-currency basis, when exited businesses are excluded from the 2018 comp. In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit business last year increased by $10 million to $210 million, strong performances within the U.S., OTC business and the addition of Ranir were partially offset by lower improved formula contract business and higher direct labor costs. Adjusted gross margin improved 40 basis points to 34% as favorable OTC product mix and the quarter was partially offset by the impact of the exited animal health business and higher cost of goods sold. 
In the international segment, adjusted gross profit increased by $1 million to $181 million for the quarter. Measuring constant currency, adjusted gross profit increased by 6.3%, primarily due to new products and to the addition of Ranir's non-U.S. business, partially offset by volume declines including in France. Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 51.9%, 190 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the addition of Ranir, which has a lower gross margin than our overall international portfolio. Shipping however, this gross margin impact is not operating margin since Ranir has lower operating expenses as a percent of sales than the rest of international. 
Moving on to adjusted operating income, Worldwide Consumer business adjusted operating income was up $2 million to $153 million as the benefit of having Ranir was mainly offset by the cost of restoring employee bonuses as compared to last year's Q3. Further adjusting for the impacts of currency and exited businesses, it was up 4.3% in the quarter. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted operating income was up $5 million to $123 million, within an adjusted operating margin at 19.8%. The same was in Q3 last year, up 4.8% when exited businesses are excluded. Increased gross margin and lower handling costs were partially offset by higher R&D spending to drive innovation. 
In the international segment, adjusted operating income was flat to prior year, at $64 million, further adjusted for currency, it was 4.4% better than last year. The adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points to 18.2%, due primarily to higher SG&A. 
Turning now to the RX segment. Adjusted gross profit decreased by $3 million to $94 million and adjusted gross margin of 40.9% was down from 48.1% in Q3 last year due to adverse pricing, higher cost of goods, primarily as a result of our third-party suppliers' inability to meet our demand and less favorable product mix. 
Adjusted operating income was lower by $2 million to $55 million, principally due to the gross profit declined and higher SG&A, somewhat offset by lower R&D expenses. 
In summary then, consolidated adjusted earnings per share and Q3 was $1.04, up $0.11 from Wall Street's expectations our fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or beating consensus. Consolidated adjusted operating income was flat to Q3 last year, as the benefits from the Ranir acquisition and savings from Project Momentum our SG&A cost reduction initiatives were offset by the restoration of full employee bonus payouts, that we expect this year and temporary headwinds in our infant nutrition business. 
With respect to the balance sheet. As of September 28, 2019, total cash and the balance sheet was $399 million in total outstanding debt was $3.4 billion. This quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2020 term loan, expanding as maturity to 2022 and lowering the interest rates by 65 basis points. 
Q3's cash flow from operations was $140 million, a cash flow conversion of almost 100%. We expect to maintain that cash conversion in the 100% range in the fourth quarter. 
And now, turning to our third quarter queue. As you will see when you read it, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment, a draft note from the IRS, covering fiscal year -- fiscal tax year's ending June 28, 2014, and June 27, 2015. The draft notebook relates to the deductibility of interest on debts owed by O2 Perrigo company PLC by Perrigo company, AUS sub. The debts we're incurred in connection with the merger with LN in 2013. The draft notebook proposes a reduction in gross interest expense, the fiscal years 2014 and 2015, details of which you may read in the queue. Where the IRS to prevail in this proposed adjustments, which we intend to contest strongly. We estimate an increase in tax expense and approximately $170 million, excluding interest on penalties. 
In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the periods from June 28, 2015, through December 31, 2019. We estimate that those further adjustments based on our preliminary calculations will not likely exceed an additional $200 million, excluding potential interest and penalties. We would not usually disclose a draft at this stage, but would wait for the final, which for the specific notebook we expect later this month. However, since the IRS has recently made it clear to us that they plan to issue the notebook without taking into account last submission to them in which we'll requested they make changes prior to issuing the final notebook. We decided to include the disclosure of it in this quarter's queue. Note payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made if a toll until all applicable proceedings have been completed. 
Turning now to our outlook for 2019. Some of the assumptions incorporated into our guidance include. Within the Americas segment, our new oral health care category will continue to drive top line growth. Our infant nutrition business is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a large new customer. ROTC business remains strong and is ready shipping Costco products to retailers, and we're seeing normal seasons. For international, we remain excited about the new product pipeline, which we anticipate will continue to drive top line growth in Q4. For RX, we don't expect to see the trend change, we remind you that we are comparing to a very strong Q4 last year, which included a high margin exclusive product launch. In summary, based on these assumptions, we are raising our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.85 to $4.05 this year. And with that, wood like to turn the call back to Murray."

From a new product standpoint, you should be very encouraged that with the light quarter end, new product sales in CSCA that we got those kind of growth rates, which means that will are obviously, building our business and doing a better job with consumers and partnering and getting distribution gains, et cetera. For the fourth quarter we -- and as I said I expect the total infant nutrition business to be up and be a driver of the total growth for the quarter.

And the other thing that I would like to do, which most could consumer products companies do is start communicating once I have a little bit more data about what I'll describe and commonly known in the consumer world as a freshness index, which will not just talk about what kind of new products we've launched in the year, but we'll talk about the percentage of our volume coming from either new products or some form of significant innovation or product improvement within the last 3 years, which as a company, great companies tend to operate in the 15% to 20% rates that'll take a little time to get there, but that's a really good measure of stickiness of new products and whether the companies innovating at the right amount or too much and there's a lot of statistical work by some really good consultants, doing industry benchmarking, to say that's the right number to target. I'll share that more in January when I get there as well, but. we're gathering all that data as we speak. And again, I like with where the company's going organically, I like where we're going on bolt on, I like the energy I see in the teams."

I hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on the perrigo.com website. Joining today's call are President and CEO, Murray Kessler; and CFO, Ray Silcock.
I'd like to remind everyone that during this call participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for shareholders and investors and safe harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. On discussing the business, Murray will reference only non-GAAP adjusted numbers for the quarter. Comparisons to prior year will also exclude exited businesses and currency changes. Ray's discussion of financial results during this call will address both GAAP and non-GAAP results, and where noted, comparisons to prior year will exclude exited businesses and currency changes. Located on our website is the appendix for today's call, which provides reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed.
A couple of other housekeeping notes to mention before we get started. Excluding exited businesses, excludes contributions from the exited animal health and infant foods businesses from both 2018 and 2019. Organic growth excludes Ranir, the exited animal health and infant foods businesses and currency. And as a reminder, Worldwide Consumer includes the Consumer Self-Care Americas and Consumer Self-Care International segments as well as corporate unallocated. One final note, given Ranir's global reach, the company has finalized operational reporting lines, where the U.S. operations of Ranir are included in the Consumer Self-Care Americas segment and its non-U.S. operations are included in the Consumer Self-Care International segment.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Murray."

I am pleased with the company's third quarter results. And it's worth noting that this is the first time I've said that about a quarter, even though this is the fourth quarter in a row that our results have met or exceeded expectations. What differentiates this quarter is that our top line is growing again, as many of the initiatives we implemented as part of our strategic plan are beginning to take effect. And while a meaningful portion of this quarter's double-digit growth is due to the bolt-on acquisition of Ranir, the organic growth results were also solid. Really, the company hit on almost all cylinders from a revenue perspective, with one exception, infant nutrition, which was explained last quarter and which will be further detailed in a moment. Cost control also benefited the company's results as we enjoyed overhead savings from Project Momentum. All in all, I like the direction we are headed. We are executing well and I believe we are on track to achieve our stated 3%, 5%, 7% long-term consumer growth objectives. 
Let me go into a bit more detail. Total Perrigo consolidated net sales grew just over 10% versus a year ago. All segments contributed to this growth, including a 9% increase in Consumer Self-Care Americas, a 10% increase in Consumer Self-Care International and a 13% increase in generic Rx. CSCA net sales growth of 9% was led by the incremental addition of the U.S. Ranir's sales of $54 million, and an increase of 3% or $13 million of organic net sales growth on our OTC business. From a consumption basis, OTC category growth remained strong growing 2% in revenue during the third quarter versus a year ago according to IRI. For the same period, store brand retail dollars grew 2.8%, outpacing national brand growth of 1.6%, which was a 30 basis point share gain per store brands. OTC share gains were driven by solid growth in our allergy and smoking cessation categories. What most excites me here is beyond the growth is the renewed purpose, with which Perrigo teams are attacking and winning in our core categories. Solid organic OTC growth was partially offset by an 11% decline versus a year ago in our infant nutrition business. The infant nutrition performance during the quarter was as expected and as explained in last quarter's conference call. Remember the second quarter infant nutrition results were hurt by a contract packing inventory issue and retail disruption from a product recall. Importantly, the retail issue is behind us, as the U.S. store brand infant formula business returned to growth in the third quarter, increasing 4% versus a year ago. And while the contract packed sales inventory issue continued in Q3, it was expected. The good news is we're almost through that issue as well, and looking forward, we have a strong pipeline of new infant formula products, many of which are launching as we speak, and we have gained distribution at a major new customer. Said another way, we see infant nutrition in total growing again versus a year ago in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales increased 10% versus a year ago. While the CSCI results benefited from over $23 million in incremental sales from Ranir, we saw solid organic growth of over 3%. The 3% organic growth in CSCI was driven by $28 million in new product launches and good selling activities for the cough/cold season in Europe. I'd also note that France, which I highlighted last quarter, is well on its way to being corrected as we now have our sales force back up to full strength, and we have a solid pipeline of new products ready to launch early next year.
Finally, our Rx segment continued to perform well and outperformed most generic Rx companies, growing 13% versus a year ago in the quarter. It's worth noting we did have service issues related to supply -- to interruption from several of our key suppliers not meeting their production goals and time line.
So in summary, I repeat it was a solid quarter, good quality. We still have a lot to do to be able to consistently report this type of growth, but we're heading in the right direction. Perrigo teams across the world are starting to win again and the teams are energized. And of course, we all believe we are recapturing the Perrigo advantage and are certain that we will make lives better by bringing quality, affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they're sold.
I'll now turn the call over to Ray."

Now that Murray has gone through the sales highlights for the quarter, I'd like to walk you through the rest of the Q3 P&L, briefly focus on the balance sheet and provide some color and commentary on our outlook for the rest of 2019.
Consolidated reported net income for Q3 was $92 million and reported diluted EPS was $0.67 per share, which included an $18 million or $0.11 charge for our voluntary retail market recall of ranitidine, the cost of which was removed from our adjusted net income for the quarter. Consolidated adjusted net income for the quarter was $142 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.04 per share, up $0.11 from Wall Street consensus, our third sequential quarterly earnings beat and our fourth sequential quarter of meeting or exceeding market expectations.
Adjusted net income includes $50 million of non-GAAP adjustments. We're adding back $81 million of amortization, $18 million related to the acquisition of Ranir, $18 million from the ranitidine recall, an $11 million impairment of [indiscernible] an Rx brand and $17 million of restructuring business separation and unusual litigation. And then we're subtracting a $72 million gain from the sale of the animal health business together with $31 million in tax impacts from all of these adjustments. Our reported consolidated effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.2%, much lower than in the recent quarters, primarily as a result of the tax loss that arose from the sale of the animal health business, despite the fact that we had a $72 million book gain. Since we exclude that gain from our adjusted results, we have eliminated the associated tax impact as well. This increased Q3 effective tax rate from a GAAP rate of 5.2% to a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.1%. Details of all these adjustments can be found in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release.
From this point foreword, all my comments and numbers are on a non-GAAP basis. Moving now to segment reporting. I'm going to start by reviewing the results of our Worldwide Consumer business, which is comprised of the Consumers Self-Care Americas segment, the Consumer Self-Care International segment and corporate unallocated, followed by the results of the 2 segments individually. 
I'll discuss the Rx segment afterwards. Worldwide Consumer adjusted gross profit as compared to last year was up $12 million to $392 million, which amounted to an increase of 9% on a constant currency basis, when exited businesses are excluded from the 2018 comp. In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit versus last year increased by $10 million to $210 million. Strong performances within the U.S. OTC business and the addition of Ranir were partially offset by lower infant formula contract business and higher direct labor costs. Adjusted gross margin improved 40 basis points to 34% as favorable OTC product mix in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of the exited animal health business and higher cost of goods sold. 
In the International segment, adjusted gross profit increased by $1 million to $181 million for the quarter. Measured in constant currency, adjusted gross profit increased by 6.3%, primarily due to new products and to the addition of Ranir's non-U.S. business, partially offset by volume declines including in France.
Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 51.9%, 190 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the addition of Ranir, which has a lower gross margin than our overall International portfolio. It should be noted, however, that this gross margin impact does not fall through to operating margin since Ranir has lower operating expenses as a percent of sales than the rest of International.
Moving on to adjusted operating income. Worldwide Consumer business adjusted operating income was up $2 million to $153 million as the benefit of adding Ranir was mainly offset by the cost of restoring employee bonuses as compared to last year's Q3. Further adjusting for the impacts of currency and exited businesses, it was up 4.3% in the quarter. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted operating income was up $5 million to $123 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 19.8%. The same was in Q3 last year, up 4.8% when exited businesses are excluded. Increased gross margin and lower admin costs were partially offset by higher R&D spending to drive innovation.
In the International segment, adjusted operating income was flat to prior year at $64 million. Further adjusted for currency, it was 4.4% better than last year. The adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points to 18.2%, due primarily to higher SG&A.
Turning now to the Rx segment. Adjusted gross profit decreased by $3 million to $94 million, and adjusted gross margin of 40.9% was down from 48.1% in Q3 last year due to adverse pricing, higher cost of goods primarily as a result of our third-party suppliers' inability to meet our demand and less favorable product mix. Adjusted operating income was lower by $2 million to $55 million, principally due to the gross profit decline and higher SG&A, somewhat offset by lower R&D expenses.
In summary, then, consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.04, up $0.11 from Wall Street's expectations, our fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or beating consensus. Consolidated adjusted operating income was flat to Q3 last year as the benefits from the Ranir acquisition and savings from Project Momentum, our SG&A cost reduction initiative, were offset by the restoration of full employee bonus payout that we expect this year and temporary headwinds in our infant nutrition business.
With respect to the balance sheet. As of September 28, 2019, total cash on the balance sheet was $399 million, and total outstanding debt was $3.4 billion. This quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2020 term loan, extending its maturity to 2022 and lowering the interest rate by 65 basis points. Q3's cash flow from operations was $140 million, a cash flow conversion of almost 100%. We expect to maintain that cash conversion in the 100% range in the fourth quarter. 
And now turning to our third quarter Q. As you will see when you read it, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment, a draft NOPA, from the IRS covering fiscal year -- fiscal tax year ending June 28, 2014, and June 27, 2015. The draft NOPA relates to the deductibility of interest on debts owed by -- owed to Perrigo Company plc by Perrigo Company, a U.S. sub. The debts were incurred in connection with the merger with Elan in 2013. The draft NOPA proposes a reduction in gross interest expense for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, details of which you may read in the Q. Where the IRS to prevail in this proposed adjustment, which we intend to contest strongly, we estimate an increase in tax expense of approximately $170 million excluding interest on penalties. In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the periods from June 28, 2015, through December 31, 2019. We estimate that those further adjustments based on our preliminary calculations will not likely exceed an additional $200 million, excluding potential interest and penalties. We would not usually disclose a draft NOPA at this stage but would wait for the final, which for this specific NOPA we expect later this month. However, since the IRS has recently made it clear to us that they plan to issue the NOPA without taking into account our last submission to them, in which we requested they make changes prior to issuing the final NOPA. We decided to include the disclosure of it in this quarter's Q. No payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made if at all until all applicable proceedings have been completed.
Turning now to our outlook for 2019. Some of the assumptions incorporated into our guidance include: within the Americas segment, our new oral self-care category will continue to drive top line growth. Our infant nutrition business is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a large new customer. Our OTC business remains strong and is ready shipping cough/cold product to retailers, and we're seeing a normal season. For International, we remain excited about the new product pipeline, which we anticipate will continue to drive top line growth in Q4. For Rx, while we don't expect to see the trend change, we remind you that we are comparing to a very strong Q4 last year, which included a high margin exclusive product launch.
In summary, based on these assumptions, we are raising our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.85 to $4.05 this year.
And with that, I would like to turn the call back to Murray."

And that -- the only issue that makes us look like organic growth is in its strong -- the infant formula contract business that I highlighted. From a new product standpoint, you should feel very encouraged that with a light quarter and new product sales in CSCA that we got those kind of growth rates, which means that we're obviously building our business and doing a better job with consumer and partnering and getting distribution gains, et cetera. For the fourth quarter, we -- as I said, I expect the total infant nutrition business to be up and be a driver of the total growth for the quarter. So we won't be looking at any more declines on infant nutrition as they have a very strong new products quarter starting out launches that are in place and already -- they're imminently shipping. So those are not like promises to happen, that's about to really happen. So I feel very, very good about the organic growth across the whole company."

And innovation is ramping up significantly. And a large part of that is that, that team is working together and sharing ideas and work that's been accomplished and completed across the world. And not only from Europe, CSCI back to CSCA, but also from region to region in Europe, as an example, taking winning skincare products in the Nordic regions and launching them under existing brand names in other parts of Western Europe as another example. So you're really seeing like hundreds of ideas. I quoted the number of $0.5 billion plus in new products. That number is growing. And I go out in my January call going forward.

That will take us a little time to get there, but that's a really good measure of stickiness of new products and whether the company's innovating at the right amount or too much and there is a lot of statistical work by some really good consultants doing industry benchmarking to say that's the right number to target.

Joining today's call are President and CEO, Murray Kessler; and CFO, Ray Silcock.
I'd like to remind everyone that during this call participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for shareholders and investors and safe harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. 
On discussing the business, Murray will reference only non-GAAP adjusted numbers for the quarter. Comparisons to prior year will also exclude exited businesses and currency changes. Ray's discussion of financial results during this call will address both GAAP and non-GAAP results, and where noted, comparisons to prior year will exclude exited businesses and currency changes. Located on our website is the appendix for today's call, which provides reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed.
A couple of other housekeeping notes to mention before we get started. Excluding exited businesses, excludes contributions from the exited animal health and infant foods businesses from both 2018 and 2019. 
Organic growth excludes Ranir, the exited animal health and infant foods businesses and currency. And as a reminder, Worldwide Consumer includes the Consumer Self-Care Americas and Consumer Self-Care International segments as well as corporate unallocated. 
One final note, given Ranir's global reach, the company has finalized operational reporting lines, where the U.S. operations of Ranir are included in the Consumer Self-Care Americas segment and its non-U.S. operations are included in the Consumer Self-Care International segment.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Murray."

I am pleased with the company's third quarter results. And it's worth noting that this is the first time I've said that about a quarter, even though this is the fourth quarter in a row that our results have met or exceeded expectations.
What differentiates this quarter is that our top line is growing again, as many of the initiatives we implemented as part of our strategic plan are beginning to take effect. And while a meaningful portion of this quarter's double-digit growth is due to the bolt-on acquisition of Ranir, the organic growth results were also solid. Really, the company hit on almost all cylinders from a revenue perspective, with one exception, infant nutrition, which was explained last quarter and which will be further detailed in a moment. Cost control also benefited the company's results as we enjoyed overhead savings from Project Momentum. 
All in all, I like the direction we are headed. We are executing well and I believe we are on track to achieve our stated 3%, 5%, 7% long-term consumer growth objectives. 
Let me go into a bit more detail. Total Perrigo consolidated net sales grew just over 10% versus a year ago. All segments contributed to this growth, including a 9% increase in Consumer Self-Care Americas, a 10% increase in Consumer Self-Care International and a 13% increase in generic Rx. CSCA net sales growth of 9% was led by the incremental addition of the U.S. Ranir's sales of $54 million, and an increase of 3% or $13 million of organic net sales growth on our OTC business. 
From a consumption basis, OTC category growth remained strong, growing 2% in revenue during the third quarter versus a year ago according to IRI. For the same period, store brand retail dollars grew 2.8%, outpacing national brand growth of 1.6%, which was a 30 basis point share gain per store brands. OTC share gains were driven by solid growth in our allergy and smoking cessation categories. 
What most excites me here is beyond the growth is the renewed purpose with which Perrigo teams are attacking and winning in our core categories. Solid organic OTC growth was partially offset by an 11% decline versus a year ago in our infant nutrition business. The infant nutrition performance during the quarter was as expected and as explained in last quarter's conference call. 
Remember, the second quarter infant nutrition results were hurt by a contract packing inventory issue and retail disruption from a product recall. Importantly, the retail issue is behind us, as the U.S. store brand infant formula business returned to growth in the third quarter, increasing 4% versus a year ago. 
And while the contract packed sales inventory issue continued in Q3, it was expected. The good news is we're almost through that issue as well, and looking forward, we have a strong pipeline of new infant formula products, many of which are launching as we speak, and we have gained distribution at a major new customer. Said another way, we see infant nutrition in total growing again versus a year ago in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales increased 10% versus a year ago. While the CSCI results benefited from over $23 million in incremental sales from Ranir, we saw solid organic growth of over 3%. The 3% organic growth in CSCI was driven by $28 million in new product launches and good selling activities for the cough/cold season in Europe. 
I'd also note that France, which I highlighted last quarter, is well on its way to being corrected as we now have our sales force back up to full strength, and we have a solid pipeline of new products ready to launch early next year.
Finally, our Rx segment continued to perform well and outperformed most generic Rx companies, growing 13% versus a year ago in the quarter. It's worth noting we did have service issues related to supply -- to interruption from several of our key suppliers not meeting their production goals and time line.
So in summary, I repeat, it was a solid quarter, good quality. We still have a lot to do to be able to consistently report this type of growth, but we're heading in the right direction. Perrigo teams across the world are starting to win again and the teams are energized. 
And of course, we all believe we are recapturing the Perrigo advantage and are certain that we will make lives better by bringing quality, affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they're sold.
I'll now turn the call over to Ray."

Now that Murray has gone through the sales highlights for the quarter, I'd like to walk you through the rest of the Q3 P&L, briefly focus on the balance sheet and provide some color and commentary on our outlook for the rest of 2019.
Consolidated reported net income for Q3 was $92 million and reported diluted EPS was $0.67 per share, which included an $18 million or $0.11 charge for our voluntary retail market recall of ranitidine, the cost of which was removed from our adjusted net income for the quarter. 
Consolidated adjusted net income for the quarter was $142 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.04 per share, up $0.11 from Wall Street consensus, our third sequential quarterly earnings beat and our fourth sequential quarter of meeting or exceeding market expectations.
Adjusted net income includes $50 million of non-GAAP adjustments. We're adding back $81 million of amortization, $18 million related to the acquisition of Ranir, $18 million from the ranitidine recall, an $11 million impairment of [ availa mist ] an Rx brand and $17 million of restructuring business separation and unusual litigation. And then we're subtracting a $72 million gain from the sale of the animal health business together with $31 million in tax impacts from all of these adjustments. 
Our reported consolidated effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.2%, much lower than in the recent quarters, primarily as a result of the tax loss that arose from the sale of the animal health business, despite the fact that we had a $72 million book gain. Since we exclude that gain from our adjusted results, we have eliminated the associated tax impact as well. This increased Q3 effective tax rate from a GAAP rate of 5.2% to a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.1%. Details of all these adjustments can be found in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release.
From this point foreword, all my comments and numbers are on a non-GAAP basis. Moving now to segment reporting. I'm going to start by reviewing the results of our Worldwide Consumer business, which is comprised of the Consumers Self-Care Americas segment, the Consumer Self-Care International segment and corporate unallocated, followed by the results of the 2 segments individually.  I'll discuss the Rx segment afterwards. 
Worldwide Consumer adjusted gross profit as compared to last year was up $12 million to $392 million, which amounted to an increase of 9% on a constant currency basis, when exited businesses are excluded from the 2018 comp. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit versus last year increased by $10 million to $210 million. Strong performances within the U.S. OTC business and the addition of Ranir were partially offset by lower infant formula contract business and higher direct labor costs. Adjusted gross margin improved 40 basis points to 34% as favorable OTC product mix in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of the exited animal health business and higher cost of goods sold. 
In the International segment, adjusted gross profit increased by $1 million to $181 million for the quarter. Measured in constant currency, adjusted gross profit increased by 6.3%, primarily due to new products and to the addition of Ranir's non-U.S. business, partially offset by volume declines, including in France.
Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 51.9%, 190 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the addition of Ranir, which has a lower gross margin than our overall International portfolio. It should be noted, however, that this gross margin impact does not fall through to operating margin since Ranir has lower operating expenses as a percent of sales than the rest of International.
Moving on to adjusted operating income. Worldwide Consumer business adjusted operating income was up $2 million to $153 million as the benefit of adding Ranir was mainly offset by the cost of restoring employee bonuses as compared to last year's Q3. Further adjusting for the impacts of currency and exited businesses, it was up 4.3% in the quarter. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted operating income was up $5 million to $123 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 19.8%, the same as in Q3 last year, up 4.8% when exited businesses are excluded. Increased gross margin and lower admin costs were partially offset by higher R&D spending to drive innovation.
In the International segment, adjusted operating income was flat to prior year at $64 million. Further adjusted for currency, it was 4.4% better than last year. The adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points to 18.2%, due primarily to higher SG&A.
Turning now to the Rx segment. Adjusted gross profit decreased by $3 million to $94 million, and adjusted gross margin of 40.9% was down from 48.1% in Q3 last year due to adverse pricing, higher cost of goods primarily as a result of our third-party suppliers' inability to meet our demand and less favorable product mix. Adjusted operating income was lower by $2 million to $55 million, principally due to the gross profit decline and higher SG&A, somewhat offset by lower R&D expenses.
In summary, then, consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.04, up $0.11 from Wall Street's expectations, our fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or beating consensus. Consolidated adjusted operating income was flat to Q3 last year as the benefits from the Ranir acquisition and savings from Project Momentum, our SG&A cost reduction initiative, were offset by the restoration of full employee bonus payout that we expect this year and temporary headwinds in our infant nutrition business.
With respect to the balance sheet. As of September 28, 2019, total cash on the balance sheet was $399 million, and total outstanding debt was $3.4 billion. This quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2020 term loan, extending its maturity to 2022 and lowering the interest rate by 65 basis points. Q3's cash flow from operations was $140 million, a cash flow conversion of almost 100%. We expect to maintain that cash conversion in the 100% range in the fourth quarter. 
And now turning to our third quarter Q. As you will see when you read it, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment, a draft NOPA, from the IRS covering fiscal year -- fiscal tax years ending June 28, 2014, and June 27, 2015. The draft NOPA relates to the deductibility of interest on debts owed by -- owed to Perrigo Company plc by Perrigo Company, a U.S. sub. The debts were incurred in connection with the merger with Elan in 2013. 
The draft NOPA proposes a reduction in gross interest expense for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, details of which you may read in the Q. Were the IRS to prevail in this proposed adjustment, which we intend to contest strongly, we estimate an increase in tax expense of approximately $170 million, excluding interest on penalties. 
In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the periods from June 28, 2015, through December 31, 2019. We estimate that those further adjustments, based on our preliminary calculations, will not likely exceed an additional $200 million, excluding potential interest and penalties. We would not usually disclose a draft NOPA at this stage but would wait for the final, which for this specific NOPA, we expect later this month. 
However, since the IRS has recently made it clear to us that they plan to issue the NOPA, without taking into account our submission to them, in which we requested they make changes prior to issuing the final NOPA, we decided to include the disclosure of it in this quarter's Q. No payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made if at all until all applicable proceedings have been completed.
Turning now to our outlook for 2019. Some of the assumptions incorporated into our guidance include: within the Americas segment, our new oral self-care category will continue to drive top line growth. Our infant nutrition business is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a large new customer. Our OTC business remains strong and is already shipping cough/cold product to retailers, and we're assuming a normal season. 
For International, we remain excited about the new product pipeline, which we anticipate will continue to drive top line growth in Q4. For Rx, while we don't expect to see the trend change, we remind you that we are comparing to a very strong Q4 last year, which included a high margin exclusive product launch.
In summary, based on these assumptions, we are raising our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.85 to $4.05 a share
And with that, I would like to turn the call back to Murray."

From a new product standpoint, you should feel very encouraged that with a light quarter and new product sales in CSCA, that we got those kind of growth rates, which means that we're, obviously, building our business and doing a better job with consumer and partnering and getting distribution gains, et cetera. 
For the fourth quarter, we -- as I said, I expect the total infant nutrition business to be up and be a driver of the total growth for the quarter. So we won't be looking at any more declines on infant nutrition as they have a very strong new products quarter, starting out launches that are in place and already -- they're imminently shipping. So those are not like promises to happen, that's about to really happen. So I feel very, very good about the organic growth across the whole company."

In fact, I'm not sure if the U.S. will see any loss of sales because consumers will gravitate to other products. But this was not something unique to Perrigo. It was worldwide and industry-wide and there's been a lot of clarity provided actually in the last couple of days on that by the FDA.
As far as new products go, I am not going to speak to future new product launch. That's competitive. It's my job to get to the 3%, 5%, 7% numbers I have promised every way, and I have many tools in my toolbox to do that. And new products is a key component of it.

When I go to do investor -- like I started early following May 9, everyone -- or before May 9, everybody sort of questioned whether we -- what was self-care and could you do bolt-ons? 
And then after May 9, when we -- they saw Ranir and then Prevacid a few months later, as I've gotten further investor calls, everybody says, okay, I believe you now on bolt-on, but how will the innovation ramp up? And innovation is ramping up significantly and a large part of that is that, that team is working together and sharing ideas and work that's been accomplished and completed across the world, not only from Europe, CSCI back to CSCA, but also from region to region in Europe, as an example, taking winning skincare products in the Nordic regions and launching them under existing brand names in other parts of Western Europe as another example. 
So you're really seeing like hundreds of ideas. I quoted the number of $0.5 billion plus in new products. That number is growing. And I go out in my January call going forward, I'm going to spend a lot of time on innovation to share how we see that growing because I think that's the next question. I know you can do bolt-ons, can you innovate, and that's already starting to happen. So -- which is great news. A lot it faster than I thought. Some of it still will take a couple years. Am I going to give you specific categories? No, it's almost going to be a mindset across the business. You should expect innovation across all of our businesses in the coming year.

And the other thing that I would like to do, which most good consumer products companies do, is start communicating once I have a little bit more data about what I'll describe and it's commonly known in the consumer world as a freshness index, which we'll not just talk about what kind of new products we've launched in the year, but we'll talk about the percentage of our volume coming from either new products or some form of significant innovation or product improvement within the last 3 years, which as a company, great companies tend to operate in the 15% to 20% rate. 
That will take us a little time to get there, but that's a really good measure of stickiness of new products and whether the company's innovating at the right amount or too much and there is a lot of statistical work by some really good consultants doing industry benchmarking to say that's the right number to target.
I'll share that more in January when I get there as well, but we're gathering all that data as we speak. And again, I like where the company is going organically. I like where we're going on bolt-on. I like the energy I see in the teams."

I hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on the perrigo.com website. Joining today's call are President and CEO, Murray Kessler; and CFO, Ray Silcock.
I'd like to remind everyone that during this call participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for shareholders and investors and safe harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. 
On discussing the business, Murray will reference only non-GAAP adjusted numbers for the quarter. Comparisons to prior year will also exclude exited businesses and currency changes. Ray's discussion of financial results during this call will address both GAAP and non-GAAP results, and where noted, comparisons to prior year will exclude exited businesses and currency changes. Located on our website is the appendix for today's call, which provides reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed.
A couple of other housekeeping notes to mention before we get started. Excluding exited businesses, excludes contributions from the exited animal health and infant foods businesses from both 2018 and 2019. 
Organic growth excludes Ranir, the exited animal health and infant foods businesses and currency. And as a reminder, Worldwide Consumer includes the Consumer Self-Care Americas and Consumer Self-Care International segments as well as corporate unallocated. 
One final note, given Ranir's global reach, the company has finalized operational reporting lines, where the U.S. operations of Ranir are included in the Consumer Self-Care Americas segment and its non-U.S. operations are included in the Consumer Self-Care International segment.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Murray."

I am pleased with the company's third quarter results.

I am pleased with the company's third quarter results. And it's worth noting that this is the first time I've said that about a quarter, even though this is the fourth quarter in a row that our results have met or exceeded expectations.
What differentiates this quarter is that our top line is growing again, as many of the initiatives we implemented as part of our strategic plan are beginning to take effect. And while a meaningful portion of this quarter's double-digit growth is due to the bolt-on acquisition of Ranir, the organic growth results were also solid. Really, the company hit on almost all cylinders from a revenue perspective, with one exception, infant nutrition, which was explained last quarter and which will be further detailed in a moment. Cost control also benefited the company's results as we enjoyed overhead savings from Project Momentum. 
All in all, I like the direction we are headed. We are executing well and I believe we are on track to achieve our stated 3%, 5%, 7% long-term consumer growth objectives. 
Let me go into a bit more detail. Total Perrigo consolidated net sales grew just over 10% versus a year ago. All segments contributed to this growth, including a 9% increase in Consumer Self-Care Americas, a 10% increase in Consumer Self-Care International and a 13% increase in generic Rx. CSCA net sales growth of 9% was led by the incremental addition of the U.S. Ranir's sales of $54 million, and an increase of 3% or $13 million of organic net sales growth on our OTC business. 
From a consumption basis, OTC category growth remained strong, growing 2% in revenue during the third quarter versus a year ago according to IRI. For the same period, store brand retail dollars grew 2.8%, outpacing national brand growth of 1.6%, which was a 30 basis point share gain per store brands. OTC share gains were driven by solid growth in our allergy and smoking cessation categories. 
What most excites me here is beyond the growth is the renewed purpose with which Perrigo teams are attacking and winning in our core categories. Solid organic OTC growth was partially offset by an 11% decline versus a year ago in our infant nutrition business. The infant nutrition performance during the quarter was as expected and as explained in last quarter's conference call. 
Remember, the second quarter infant nutrition results were hurt by a contract packing inventory issue and retail disruption from a product recall. Importantly, the retail issue is behind us, as the U.S. store brand infant formula business returned to growth in the third quarter, increasing 4% versus a year ago. 
And while the contract packed sales inventory issue continued in Q3, it was expected. The good news is we're almost through that issue as well, and looking forward, we have a strong pipeline of new infant formula products, many of which are launching as we speak, and we have gained distribution at a major new customer. Said another way, we see infant nutrition in total growing again versus a year ago in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales increased 10% versus a year ago. While the CSCI results benefited from over $23 million in incremental sales from Ranir, we saw solid organic growth of over 3%. The 3% organic growth in CSCI was driven by $28 million in new product launches and good selling activities for the cough/cold season in Europe. 
I'd also note that France, which I highlighted last quarter, is well on its way to being corrected as we now have our sales force back up to full strength, and we have a solid pipeline of new products ready to launch early next year.
Finally, our Rx segment continued to perform well and outperformed most generic Rx companies, growing 13% versus a year ago in the quarter. It's worth noting we did have service issues related to supply -- to interruption from several of our key suppliers not meeting their production goals and time line.
So in summary, I repeat, it was a solid quarter, good quality. We still have a lot to do to be able to consistently report this type of growth, but we're heading in the right direction. Perrigo teams across the world are starting to win again and the teams are energized. 
And of course, we all believe we are recapturing the Perrigo advantage and are certain that we will make lives better by bringing quality, affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they're sold.
I'll now turn the call over to Ray."

Now that Murray has gone through the sales highlights for the quarter, I'd like to walk you through the rest of the Q3 P&L, briefly focus on the balance sheet and provide some color and commentary on our outlook for the rest of 2019.
Consolidated reported net income for Q3 was $92 million and reported diluted EPS was $0.67 per share, which included an $18 million or $0.11 charge for our voluntary retail market recall of ranitidine, the cost of which was removed from our adjusted net income for the quarter. 
Consolidated adjusted net income for the quarter was $142 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.04 per share, up $0.11 from Wall Street consensus, our third sequential quarterly earnings beat and our fourth sequential quarter of meeting or exceeding market expectations.
Adjusted net income includes $50 million of non-GAAP adjustments. We're adding back $81 million of amortization, $18 million related to the acquisition of Ranir, $18 million from the ranitidine recall, an $11 million impairment of [ availa mist ] an Rx brand and $17 million of restructuring business separation and unusual litigation. And then we're subtracting a $72 million gain from the sale of the animal health business together with $31 million in tax impacts from all of these adjustments. 
Our reported consolidated effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.2%, much lower than in the recent quarters, primarily as a result of the tax loss that arose from the sale of the animal health business, despite the fact that we had a $72 million book gain. Since we exclude that gain from our adjusted results, we have eliminated the associated tax impact as well. This increased Q3 effective tax rate from a GAAP rate of 5.2% to a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.1%. Details of all these adjustments can be found in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release.
From this point forward, all my comments and numbers are on a non-GAAP basis. Moving now to segment reporting. I'm going to start by reviewing the results of our Worldwide Consumer business, which is comprised of the Consumers Self-Care Americas segment, the Consumer Self-Care International segment and corporate unallocated, followed by the results of the 2 segments individually.  I'll discuss the Rx segment afterwards. 
Worldwide Consumer adjusted gross profit as compared to last year was up $12 million to $392 million, which amounted to an increase of 9% on a constant currency basis, when exited businesses are excluded from the 2018 comp. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit versus last year increased by $10 million to $210 million. Strong performances within the U.S. OTC business and the addition of Ranir were partially offset by lower infant formula contract business and higher direct labor costs. Adjusted gross margin improved 40 basis points to 34% as favorable OTC product mix in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of the exited animal health business and higher cost of goods sold. 
In the International segment, adjusted gross profit increased by $1 million to $181 million for the quarter. Measured in constant currency, adjusted gross profit increased by 6.3%, primarily due to new products and to the addition of Ranir's non-U.S. business, partially offset by volume declines, including in France.
Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 51.9%, 190 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the addition of Ranir, which has a lower gross margin than our overall International portfolio. It should be noted, however, that this gross margin impact does not fall through to operating margin since Ranir has lower operating expenses as a percent of sales than the rest of International.
Moving on to adjusted operating income. Worldwide Consumer business adjusted operating income was up $2 million to $153 million as the benefit of adding Ranir was mainly offset by the cost of restoring employee bonuses as compared to last year's Q3. Further adjusting for the impacts of currency and exited businesses, it was up 4.3% in the quarter. 
In the Americas segment, adjusted operating income was up $5 million to $123 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 19.8%, the same as in Q3 last year, up 4.8% when exited businesses are excluded. Increased gross margin and lower admin costs were partially offset by higher R&D spending to drive innovation.
In the International segment, adjusted operating income was flat to prior year at $64 million. Further adjusted for currency, it was 4.4% better than last year. The adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points to 18.2%, due primarily to higher SG&A.
Turning now to the Rx segment. Adjusted gross profit decreased by $3 million to $94 million, and adjusted gross margin of 40.9% was down from 48.1% in Q3 last year due to adverse pricing, higher cost of goods primarily as a result of our third-party suppliers' inability to meet our demand and less favorable product mix. Adjusted operating income was lower by $2 million to $55 million, principally due to the gross profit decline and higher SG&A, somewhat offset by lower R&D expenses.
In summary, then, consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.04, up $0.11 from Wall Street's expectations, our fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or beating consensus. Consolidated adjusted operating income was flat to Q3 last year as the benefits from the Ranir acquisition and savings from Project Momentum, our SG&A cost reduction initiative, were offset by the restoration of full employee bonus payout that we expect this year and temporary headwinds in our infant nutrition business.
With respect to the balance sheet. As of September 28, 2019, total cash on the balance sheet was $399 million, and total outstanding debt was $3.4 billion. This quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2020 term loan, extending its maturity to 2022 and lowering the interest rate by 65 basis points. Q3's cash flow from operations was $140 million, a cash flow conversion of almost 100%. We expect to maintain that cash conversion in the 100% range in the fourth quarter. 
And now turning to our third quarter Q. As you will see when you read it, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment, a draft NOPA, from the IRS covering fiscal year -- fiscal tax years ending June 28, 2014, and June 27, 2015. The draft NOPA relates to the deductibility of interest on debts owed by -- owed to Perrigo Company plc by Perrigo Company, a U.S. sub. The debts were incurred in connection with the merger with Elan in 2013. 
The draft NOPA proposes a reduction in gross interest expense for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, details of which you may read in the Q. Were the IRS to prevail in this proposed adjustment, which we intend to contest strongly, we estimate an increase in tax expense of approximately $170 million, excluding interest on penalties. 
In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the periods from June 28, 2015, through December 31, 2019. We estimate that those further adjustments, based on our preliminary calculations, will not likely exceed an additional $200 million, excluding potential interest and penalties. We would not usually disclose a draft NOPA at this stage but would wait for the final, which for this specific NOPA, we expect later this month. 
However, since the IRS has recently made it clear to us that they plan to issue the NOPA, without taking into account our submission to them, in which we requested they make changes prior to issuing the final NOPA, we decided to include the disclosure of it in this quarter's Q. No payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made if at all until all applicable proceedings have been completed.
Turning now to our outlook for 2019. Some of the assumptions incorporated into our guidance include: within the Americas segment, our new oral self-care category will continue to drive top line growth. Our infant nutrition business is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a large new customer. Our OTC business remains strong and is already shipping cough/cold product to retailers, and we're assuming a normal season. 
For International, we remain excited about the new product pipeline, which we anticipate will continue to drive top line growth in Q4. For Rx, while we don't expect to see the trend change, we remind you that we are comparing to a very strong Q4 last year, which included a high margin exclusive product launch.
In summary, based on these assumptions, we are raising our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.85 to $4.05 a share
And with that, I would like to turn the call back to Murray."

From a new product standpoint, you should feel very encouraged that with a light quarter and new product sales in CSCA, that we got those kind of growth rates, which means that we're, obviously, building our business and doing a better job with consumer and partnering and getting distribution gains, et cetera. 
For the fourth quarter, we -- as I said, I expect the total infant nutrition business to be up and be a driver of the total growth for the quarter. So we won't be looking at any more declines on infant nutrition as they have a very strong new products quarter, starting out launches that are in place and already -- they're imminently shipping.

And that $18 million was -- it's a combination of bringing back inventory from wholesalers. It wasn't a consumer recall and any inventory that we had on hand had any wrong ingredients of materials that were where. So that's everything involved with the recall. We didn't adjust for any loss of sales.
In fact, I'm not sure if the U.S. will see any loss of sales because consumers will gravitate to other products. But this was not something unique to Perrigo. It was worldwide and industry-wide and there's been a lot of clarity provided actually in the last couple of days on that by the FDA.
As far as new products go, I am not going to speak to future new product launch. That's competitive. It's my job to get to the 3%, 5%, 7% numbers I have promised every way, and I have many tools in my toolbox to do that. And new products is a key component of it. As a company, we actually had a good quarter new product-wise. It was more driven by CSCI, but I'm really not going to dissect it down to by division, by brand. That's what you're paying me for."

And then after May 9, when we -- they saw Ranir and then Prevacid a few months later, as I've gotten further investor calls, everybody says, okay, I believe you now on bolt-on, but how will the innovation ramp up? And innovation is ramping up significantly and a large part of that is that, that team is working together and sharing ideas and work that's been accomplished and completed across the world, not only from Europe, CSCI back to CSCA, but also from region to region in Europe, as an example, taking winning skincare products in the Nordic regions and launching them under existing brand names in other parts of Western Europe as another example. 
So you're really seeing like hundreds of ideas. I quoted the number of $0.5 billion plus in new products. That number is growing. And I go out in my January call going forward, I'm going to spend a lot of time on innovation to share how we see that growing because I think that's the next question.

And the other thing that I would like to do, which most good consumer products companies do, is start communicating once I have a little bit more data about what I'll describe and it's commonly known in the consumer world as a freshness index, which we'll not just talk about what kind of new products we've launched in the year, but we'll talk about the percentage of our volume coming from either new products or some form of significant innovation or product improvement within the last 3 years, which as a company, great companies tend to operate in the 15% to 20% rate. 
That will take us a little time to get there, but that's a really good measure of stickiness of new products and whether the company's innovating at the right amount or too much and there is a lot of statistical work by some really good consultants doing industry benchmarking to say that's the right number to target.
