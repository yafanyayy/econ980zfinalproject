Now let's turn to Robert Half's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018. Company-wide revenues were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income per share in the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2017. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a onetime, noncash charge to our provision for income taxes related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount recorded was $34 million or $0.27 per share and resulted primarily from a revaluation of our deferred income tax net assets as of December 31, 2017. Excluding this charge, our net income per share was $0.65 for the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Accompanying the release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year net income and diluted net income growth on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. The term as adjusted reflects the impact to our 2017 and 2018 provisions for income taxes, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Cash flow from operations was $123 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million in the fourth quarter. In December 2018, we distributed a total of $34 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.28 per share quarterly cash dividend. We also repurchased 2.4 million Robert Half shares in the fourth quarter at a cost of $137 million. We have 6.7 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We ended the year strongly with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income on both a quarterly and annual basis. Full year 2018 revenues and operating income reached all-time high levels for the company with broad-based strength in our staffing and Protiviti operations. 
U.S. labor market remains very robust, with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines. During the fourth quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% from the year-ago period on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted, in this case, reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Fourth quarter total staffing revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $934 million, up 7% on a same-day basis. And non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 14% on an as-adjusted basis. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The fourth quarter had 61.7 billing days compared to 61.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. The current first quarter has 62.2 billing days compared to 63 billing days in the first quarter 1 year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $12 million in the fourth quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth by 1%.
Fourth quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $263 million with $204 million coming from business within the United States and $59 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 19% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while non-U.S. revenues were up 30% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.9%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 83 locations in 26 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin in the fourth quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues compared to 37.0% of applicable revenues in the same period 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees contributed significantly to the increase.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 120 basis points versus 1 year ago to 44.4%. Our Protiviti gross margin in the fourth quarter was $80 million [ or ] 30.2% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 30.0% of Protiviti revenues.
Fourth quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.5% of staffing revenues compared to 34.1% 1 year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's overall SG&A ratio. We ended 2018 with 14,900 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2018 with 4,700 full-time employees and contractors, up 18% from the prior year.
Fourth quarter operating income from our staffing division was $120 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $102 million in operating income, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%.
In the fourth quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million. This was down 2% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 14.4%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 32% from the prior year's fourth quarter. This produced an operating margin of 12.9%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $794 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 48.1 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance for 2019, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of '18 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues up 6.7% versus the prior year compared to an 8% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 3 weeks of January were up 10% compared to January of 2018. December revenues for our permanent placement division were up 15.5% versus 2017 compared to 13.5% increase for the full quarter. For the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues were up 15% compared to the same period last year.
This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, they represent brief periods of time, and we caution against reading too much into them.
With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $1,460,000,000 to $1,525,000,000; income per share, $0.92 to $0.98. The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 10% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis or 7% on a reported basis before adjusting for billing day and currency drags and EPS growth of 21%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subjects to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We ended the year with record results, and we continue to benefit from a very strong labor market. Companies are having trouble locating the talent they need, and Robert Half is an expert at doing this work for them. We are experienced in helping our clients find and, more importantly, hire candidates with hard-to-find skill sets, many of whom will have competing offers from other employers. Our success is due to our personalized approach, something we have done well for 70 years.
I'd like to talk a little bit about the economy and how we view the current environment. If you look at Main Street, particularly the small and midsized companies that make up the majority of our staffing clients, they need people to continue growing their businesses. According to NFIB research, business optimism remains near historically high levels for this group. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index, which also measures small business optimism, has recently shown a modest weakening in business confidence from a very high level, yet hiring plans remain robust. This tells us that small business owners are moving forward with hiring plans. In fact, the NFIB reported a record number of job openings last month. Not being able to fill these jobs fast enough is the biggest barrier to growth. 60% of business owners said they are hiring or trying to hire, and 90% of those reported fewer or no qualified applicants.
These are compelling statistics, and we believe they are evidence of a job market that is going to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Skill shortages are global, and we are confident we can be a valuable resource to companies as they navigate this tight market. It's one of the reasons have invested so heavily in developing our proprietary matching technology and laying the foundation for a world-class client and candidate experience online. And we believe you need a combination of technology and season staffing professionals to be truly effective at finding and making the right match between client and job candidate. We are making digital investments, and we are making people investments to ensure we have the right mix of both.
Quarterly results for Protiviti also reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with how this business is performing. Financial services continues to be Protiviti's biggest industry sector. They are also putting greater focus on the technology sector. Protiviti's cybersecurity services remained strong during the quarter as did their wide range of internal audit and risk and compliance solutions, such as anti-money laundering services and work in the area of digital transformation. And we are optimistic about the successful go-to-market strategy with Protiviti and our staffing operations. We are providing a full spectrum of consulting, staff augmentation and managed services to our clients.
Now Keith and I will be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

IZ versus domestic trends, while there was some slowing in Europe, it was slowing from a very high base with very tough comps. We still have double-digit growth in the International Zone, which actually exceeded the growth rate in the U.S. So we're still doing quite well internationally. As we talked about for many quarters, we were led by Germany, Belgium. More recently, Canada and Australia have participated nicely. As to Protiviti, internationally, it's been very strong in Europe. It's strong in Australia. This quarter, it was also very strong in Canada. The interesting thing and the very nice thing, not only Protiviti international, Protiviti U.S. as well, is how broad-based across their solution offerings it is. It's internal audit, it's technology consulting, Cyber privacy. It's also risk and compliance and financial services. So it's very broad-based by solution offering, and that's true both in the United States and in the U.S. As we talked about last quarter, we transferred some accounts, that previously were in Management Resources on the staffing side, to Protiviti that gets adjusted for in the pro forma non-GAAP analysis that we provide. But absent that, Protiviti's growth rates are also quite strong. And I will add that in the International Zone for Protiviti as well as in the U.S., the go-to-market, together with staffing, also continues to be very robust and was a significant contributing factor to the outperformance that Protiviti had during the quarter."

So tax rate, first of all, for the quarter, the range is 25% to 26%, which is lower than a year ago because a year ago, we had an adjustment to the Tax Act, deferred tax valuation that is not expected to repeat. For the full year, I broadened that range to 25% to 27%, with kind of 26% being in the middle. CapEx, we're predicting $60 million to $17 million. That's up quite a bit from 2018. It's consistent with the run rate. We just reported $15 million in the fourth quarter so the run rate is $60 million. I'd also add that if you look on a 10-year basis, on average, we've spent about 1.2% of revenue on CapEx. And at the high end of $70 million, we'd be at 1.1%. So while it's somewhat higher than '18, it's pretty much in line with our traditional range. Most of that additional spending is in the digital transformation area. As Max mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on improving our client and candidate digital experience both on the web and with the mobile app. We're ever broadening our use of AI. We use it in recruiting for candidate discovery. We use it when we fill jobs with matching engines. We use it in marketing where we micro target candidates and clients where we individualize the message by candidate and by client. We use it in sales where we prioritize for our field staff the leads using our scoring engines. Remember that our algorithms are driven by proprietary data, which is based on post-placement performance. We analyze the candidates with the best outcomes, and we work backwards from there to determine our algorithms. We believe we have more accounting performance data than anybody on the planet that we used to inform those algorithms. That said, you still need human beings to assess soft skills, to assess attitude, professionalism, demeanor. And you still need human beings to close candidates that have multiple opportunities. It's a long-winded answer to a pretty short question, but the point is the $60 million, $70 million is somewhat higher than the $42 million we spent in 2018."

So on the margins, first of all, temp gross margins, we expect the momentum we've seen with our pay/bill spreads to continue into the first quarter. We're thinking somewhere between 50 to 70 basis points increase year-over-year. Protiviti, the gross margins will be flat to down slightly because, remember, their staff gets their annual salary increases on January 1. And it takes some time over the course of the year to recover that, but that's ordinary. From the standpoint was there anything unusual, so first of all, with workers comp, a year ago, we had $1 million credit. This year, we had virtually 0. We did have and we always have in the fourth quarter where we true up our estimates for state unemployment, federal unemployment, FICA, et cetera, so we did have a little 20, 30 basis points, something in that range where we cleaned up all of those accruals and adjusted them to actual so that doesn't repeat into the first quarter. But again, that's very typical for the fourth quarter and the first quarter guidance. From an SG&A standpoint, as we talked about earlier, we're continuing to hire in line on headcount. Note that, overall, the SG&A percentage for staffing will go up, call it, 50, 60 basis points. Half of that is because of mix. With perm growing faster than temp and with perm having a higher SG&A, significantly higher SG&A percentage, mix alone impacts the overall reported rate. But when you put everything together, SG&A as a percent of revenue for the company, first quarter ought to be in line with what it was a a year ago, plus or minus 10 or 20 basis points either direction. So operating margins overall for the first quarter don't look that different than the fourth quarter, which means they would be up 30 to 50 basis points versus a year ago, which we're very happy with. We basically take a 7% -- our midpoint, we take a 7% reported revenue increase to a 21% increase in earnings per share."

Protiviti, the seasonal pattern, Q4 to Q1, as is always the case, internal audits quite strong in Q4 but in Q1, that gets crowded out to some degree as clients work with their external auditors to get their external audits done, and that has a seasonal impact on Protiviti.

So frankly, that has -- while there are digital-only, digital-first competitors, by and large, Protiviti's principal competitors are the Big 4. And what's different, clearly, the go-to-market with staffing and Protiviti is different and more successful and more advanced, and success breeds success. Both the staffing organization and the Protiviti organization have totally bought into we have something special, we have something no one else has under one roof. We have world-class consulting and world-class staffing. Nobody else has that. The clients understand it. The clients buy it. The clients benefit not only from a quality point of view but from a price point of view as well because by blending staffing in, the average hourly cost goes down. So I would give a big assist to their acceleration, to the go-to-market, the combined go-to-market together with Protiviti having the confidence that they can sell engagements that they might have not the full-time staff for that they have the confidence that they can find the staff on a just-in-time basis through our staffing organization, which also benefits the growth rates across their service offerings. Having said that, as I spoke to earlier, it's not just about one of their service lines, it's internal audit. It's technology consulting, and it's financial services regulatory compliance. It's amazing how balanced it is not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S. as well. So kudos to Protiviti. And it's not just Protiviti. Remember that we report revenue externally based on who has the contract with the client. So we have engagements where 80% of the hours are performed by our staffing organization, but what you see reported externally all shows up in Protiviti. And in fact, if you looked at the outperformance in revenues for the quarter, at least based on our internal expectations, externally, it all sells Protiviti, but we know internally that 75% of that was performed by our staffing organization.

Again, as we've spoken to in the past, all you have to do is lose out on your first choice then lose out on your second choice, settle on your third choice or settle for someone pretty significantly less experienced than you first hoped for before you understand you have to pay more. That's not unusual. We've seen it in every cycle. We, as a management team, individually, have all been here over 30 years. We've seen this before. This is very normal. This is very typical.

I realize there's a lot of macro uncertainty out there, but I also realize your customers are U.S. midsized companies, different than sort of multinationals. But any color you can give as to what you're seeing there."

Companies hire temporaries in part to have flexibility so when they no longer need them, they no longer have to pay, and that's been the case for 30 years. Sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes that's not, but essentially no visibility. That hasn't changed. As far as customer sentiment, as we alluded to earlier from a confident standpoint, whether it's NFIB, whether it's CEO Vista, there's many, many, many studies that says their sentiment is not quite what it was but on an absolute basis, it's still quite high. But what's key for us and what's kind of not open for dispute is that the labor markets stayed very strong. Supply and demand on the labor side is clearly still tied from a labor point of view. So our willingness to continue to invest in headcount is because we're in a very strong labor economy. And we can all debate interest rates, tariffs, China, the Fed, all of those are interesting discussion points, but the point is we're in a candidate-short market, not only in the United States but globally. And that benefits our business, and that's what we're investing in."

Now let's turn to Robert Half's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018. Company-wide revenues were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income per share in the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2017. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a onetime, noncash charge to our provision for income taxes related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount recorded was $34 million or $0.27 per share and resulted primarily from a revaluation of our deferred income tax net assets as of December 31, 2017. Excluding this charge, our net income per share was $0.65 for the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Accompanying the release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year net income and diluted net income growth on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. The term ""as-adjusted"" reflects the impact to our 2017 and 2018 provisions for income taxes, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Cash flow from operations was $123 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million in the fourth quarter. In December 2018, we distributed a total of $34 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.28 per share quarterly cash dividend. We also repurchased 2.4 million Robert Half shares in the fourth quarter at a cost of $137 million. We have 6.7 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We ended the year strongly with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income on both a quarterly and annual basis. Full year 2018 revenues and operating income reached all-time high levels for the company with broad-based strength in our staffing and Protiviti operations. 
U.S. labor market remains very robust, with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines. During the fourth quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% from the year-ago period on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term ""as-adjusted"", in this case, reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Fourth quarter total staffing revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $934 million, up 7% on a same-day basis. And non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 14% on an as-adjusted basis. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The fourth quarter had 61.7 billing days compared to 61.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. The current first quarter has 62.2 billing days compared to 63 billing days in the first quarter 1 year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $12 million in the fourth quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth by 1%.
Fourth quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $263 million with $204 million coming from business within the United States and $59 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 19% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while non-U.S. revenues were up 30% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.9%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 83 locations in 26 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin in the fourth quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues compared to 37.0% of applicable revenues in the same period 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees contributed significantly to the increase.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 120 basis points versus 1 year ago to 44.4%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin in the fourth quarter was $80 million or 30.2% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 30.0% of Protiviti revenues.
Fourth quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.5% of staffing revenues compared to 34.1% 1 year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's overall SG&A ratio. We ended 2018 with 14,900 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2018 with 4,700 full-time employees and contractors, up 18% from the prior year.
Fourth quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $120 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $102 million in operating income, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%.
In the fourth quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million. This was down 2% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 14.4%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 32% from the prior year's fourth quarter. This produced an operating margin of 12.9%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $794 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 48.1 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance for 2019, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of '18 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues up 6.7% versus the prior year compared to an 8% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 3 weeks of January were up 10% compared to January of 2018. December revenues for our permanent placement division were up 15.5% versus 2017 compared to 13.5% increase for the full quarter. For the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues were up 15% compared to the same period last year.
This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, they represent brief periods of time, and we caution against reading too much into them.
With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $1,460,000,000 to $1,525,000,000; income per share, $0.92 to $0.98. The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 10% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis or 7% on a reported basis before adjusting for billing day and currency drags and EPS growth of 21%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We ended the year with record results, and we continue to benefit from a very strong labor market. Companies are having trouble locating the talent they need, and Robert Half is expert at doing this work for them. We are experienced in helping our clients find and, more importantly, hire candidates with hard-to-find skill sets, many of whom will have competing offers from other employers. Our success is due to our personalized approach, something we have done well for 70 years.
I'd like to talk a little bit about the economy and how we view the current environment. If you look at Main Street, particularly the small and midsized companies that make up the majority of our staffing clients, they need people to continue growth -- their businesses. According to NFIB research, business optimism remains near historically high levels for this group. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index, which also measures small business optimism, has recently shown a modest weakening in business confidence from a very high level, yet hiring plans remain robust. This tells us that small business owners are moving forward with hiring plans. In fact, the NFIB reported a record number of job openings last month. Not being able to fill these jobs fast enough is the biggest barrier to growth. 60% of business owners said they are hiring or trying to hire, and 90% of those reported few or no qualified applicants.
These are compelling statistics, and we believe they are evidence of a job market that is going to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Skill shortages are global, and we are confident we can be a valuable resource to companies as they navigate this tight market. It's one of the reasons we have invested heavily in developing our proprietary matching technology and laying the foundation for a world-class client and candidate experience online. But we believe you need a combination of technology and seasoned staffing professionals to be truly effective at finding and making the right match between client and job candidate. We are making digital investments, and we are making people investments to ensure we have the right mix of both.
Quarterly results for Protiviti also reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with how this business is performing. Financial services continues to be Protiviti's biggest industry sector. They are also putting greater focus on the technology sector. Protiviti's cybersecurity services remained strong during the quarter as did their wide range of internal audit and risk and compliance solutions, such as anti-money laundering services and work in the area of digital transformation. And we are optimistic about the successful go-to-market strategy with Protiviti and our staffing operations. We are providing a full spectrum of consulting, staff augmentation and managed services to our clients.
Now Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

We still had double-digit growth in the International Zone, which actually exceeded the growth rate in the U.S. So we're still doing quite well internationally. As we've talked about for many quarters, we were led by Germany, Belgium. More recently, Canada and Australia have participated nicely. As to Protiviti, internationally, it's been very strong in Europe. It's strong in Australia. This quarter, it was also very strong in Canada. The interesting thing and the very nice thing, not only Protiviti international, Protiviti U.S. as well, is how broad-based across their solution offerings it is. It's internal audit, it's technology consulting, cyber privacy. It's also risk and compliance and financial services. So it's very broad-based by solution offering, and that's true both in the United States and in the U.S. As we talked about last quarter, we transferred some accounts that previously were in Management Resources on the staffing side, to Protiviti that gets adjusted for in the pro forma non-GAAP analysis that we provide. But absent that, Protiviti's growth rates are also quite strong. And I will add that in the International Zone for Protiviti as well as in the U.S., the go-to-market, together with staffing, also continues to be very robust and was a significant contributing factor to the outperformance that Protiviti had during the quarter."

So tax rate, first of all, for the quarter, the range is 25% to 26%, which is lower than a year ago because a year ago, we had an adjustment to the Tax Act, deferred tax valuation that is not expected to repeat.

So tax rate, first of all, for the quarter, the range is 25% to 26%, which is lower than a year ago because a year ago, we had an adjustment to the Tax Act, deferred tax valuation that is not expected to repeat. For the full year, I'd broaden that range to 25% to 27%, with kind of 26% being in the middle. CapEx, we're predicting $60 million to $17 million. That's up quite a bit from 2018. It's consistent with the run rate. We just reported $15 million in the fourth quarter, so the run rate is $60 million. I'd also add that if you look on a 10-year basis, on average, we've spent about 1.2% of revenue on CapEx. And at the high end of $70 million, we'd be at 1.1%. So while it's somewhat higher than '18, it's pretty much in line with our traditional range. Most of that additional spending is in the digital transformation area. As Max mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on improving our client and candidate digital experience, both on the web and with the mobile app. We're ever broadening our use of AI. We use it in recruiting for candidate discovery. We use it when we fill jobs with the matching engines. We use it in marketing where we micro target candidates and clients, where we individualize the message by candidate and by client. We use it in sales where we prioritize for our field staff the leads using our scoring engines. Remember that our algorithms are driven by proprietary data, which is based on post-placement performance. We analyze the candidates with the best outcomes, and we work backwards from there to determine our algorithms. We believe we have more accounting performance data than anybody on the planet that we use to inform those algorithms. That said, you still need human beings to assess soft skills, to assess attitude, professionalism, demeanor. And you still need human beings to close candidates that have multiple opportunities. It's a long-winded answer to a pretty short question, but the point is, the $60 million, $70 million is somewhat higher than the $42 million we spent in 2018."

First of all, temp gross margins, we expect the momentum we've seen with our pay/bill spreads to continue into the first quarter. We're thinking somewhere between 50 to 70 basis points increase year-over-year. Protiviti, the gross margins will be flat to down slightly because, remember, their staff gets their annual salary increases on January 1. And it takes some time over the course of the year to recover that, but that's ordinary. From the standpoint, was there anything unusual? So first of all, with workers comp, a year ago, we had $1 million credit. This year, we had virtually 0. We did have and we always have in the fourth quarter where we true up our estimates for state unemployment, federal unemployment, FICA, et cetera, so we did have a little, 20, 30 basis points, something in that range where we cleaned up all of those accruals and adjusted them to actual so that doesn't repeat into the first quarter. But again, that's very typical for the fourth quarter and the first quarter guidance. From an SG&A standpoint, as we talked about earlier, we're continuing to hire in line on headcount. Note that, overall, the SG&A percentage for staffing will go up, call it, 50, 60 basis points. Half of that's because of mix. With perm growing faster than temp, and with perm having a higher SG&A, significantly higher SG&A percentage, mix alone impacts the overall reported rate. But when you put everything together, SG&A as a percent of revenue for the company, first quarter ought to be in line with what it was a year ago, plus or minus 10 or 20 basis points either direction. So operating margins overall for the first quarter don't look that different than the fourth quarter, which means they would be up 30 to 50 basis points versus a year ago, which we're very happy with. We basically take a 7% -- at our midpoint, we take a 7% reported revenue increase to a 21% increase in earnings per share."

Protiviti, the seasonal pattern, Q4 to Q1, as is always the case, internal audits quite strong in Q4, but in Q1, that gets crowded out to some degree as clients work with their external auditors to get their external audits done, and that has a seasonal impact on Protiviti.

So frankly, that hasn't -- while there are digital-only, digital-first competitors, by and large, Protiviti's principal competitors are the Big 4. And what's different? Clearly, the go-to-market with staffing and Protiviti is different and more successful and more advanced, and success breeds success. Both the staffing organization and the Protiviti organization have totally bought into, we have something special, we have something no one else has under one roof. We have world-class consulting and world-class staffing. Nobody else has that. The clients understand it. The clients buy it. The clients benefit not only from a quality point of view but from a price point of view as well because by blending staffing in, the average hourly cost goes down. So I would give a big assist to their acceleration, to the go-to-market, the combined go-to-market, together with Protiviti having the confidence that they can sell engagements that they might have not the full-time internal staff for, that they have the confidence that they can find the staff on a just-in-time basis through our staffing organization, which also benefits the growth rates all across their service offerings. Having said that, as I spoke to earlier, it's not just about one of their service lines, it's internal audit. It's technology consulting, and it's financial services regulatory compliance. It's amazing how balanced it is, not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S. as well. So kudos to Protiviti. And it's not just Protiviti. Remember that we report revenue externally based on who has the contract with the client. So we have engagements where 80% of the hours are performed by our staffing organization, but what you see reported externally all shows up in Protiviti. And in fact, if you looked at the outperformance in revenues for the quarter, at least based on our internal expectations, externally, it all says Protiviti, but we know internally that 75% of that was performed by our staffing organization. And it's a beautiful thing because when it works together like that, it's almost magical."

That's not unusual. We've seen it in every cycle. We, as a management team, individually, have all been here over 30 years. We've seen this before. This is very normal. This is very typical.

Sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes that's not, but essentially no visibility. That hasn't changed. As far as customer sentiment, as we alluded to earlier from a confidence standpoint, whether it's NFIB, whether it's CEO Vista, there's many, many, many studies that says their sentiment is not quite what it was, but on an absolute basis, it's still quite high. But what's key for us and what's kind of not open for dispute is that the labor markets stay very strong. Supply and demand on the labor side is clearly still tight from a labor point of view. So our willingness to continue to invest in headcount, it's because we're in a very strong labor economy. And we can all debate interest rates, tariffs, China, the Fed, all of those are interesting discussion points but the point is, we're in a candidate-short market, not only in the United States but globally.

Now let's turn to Robert Half's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018. Company-wide revenues were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income per share in the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2017. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a onetime, noncash charge to our provision for income taxes related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount recorded was $34 million or $0.27 per share and resulted primarily from a revaluation of our deferred income tax net assets as of December 31, 2017. Excluding this charge, our net income per share was $0.65 for the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Accompanying the release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year net income and diluted net income growth on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. The term ""as-adjusted"" reflects the impact to our 2017 and 2018 provisions for income taxes, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Cash flow from operations was $123 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million in the fourth quarter. In December 2018, we distributed a total of $34 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.28 per share quarterly cash dividend. We also repurchased 2.4 million Robert Half shares in the fourth quarter at a cost of $137 million. We have 6.7 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We ended the year strongly with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income on both a quarterly and annual basis. Full year 2018 revenues and operating income reached all-time high levels for the company with broad-based strength in our staffing and Protiviti operations. 
U.S. labor market remains very robust, with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines. During the fourth quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% from the year-ago period on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term ""as-adjusted,"" in this case, reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Fourth quarter total staffing revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $934 million, up 7% on a same-day basis. And non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 14% on an as-adjusted basis. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The fourth quarter had 61.7 billing days compared to 61.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. The current first quarter has 62.2 billing days compared to 63 billing days in the first quarter 1 year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $12 million in the fourth quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth by 1%.
Fourth quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $263 million with $204 million coming from business within the United States and $59 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 19% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while non-U.S. revenues were up 30% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.9%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 83 locations in 26 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin in the fourth quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues compared to 37.0% of applicable revenues in the same period 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees contributed significantly to the increase.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 120 basis points versus 1 year ago to 44.4%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin in the fourth quarter was $80 million or 30.2% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 30.0% of Protiviti revenues.
Fourth quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.5% of staffing revenues compared to 34.1% 1 year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's overall SG&A ratio. We ended 2018 with 14,900 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2018 with 4,700 full-time employees and contractors, up 18% from the prior year.
Fourth quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $120 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $102 million in operating income, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%.
In the fourth quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million. This was down 2% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 14.4%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 32% from the prior year's fourth quarter. This produced an operating margin of 12.9%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $794 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 48.1 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance for 2019, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of '18 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues up 6.7% versus the prior year compared to an 8% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 3 weeks of January were up 10% compared to January of 2018. December revenues for our permanent placement division were up 15.5% versus 2017 compared to 13.5% increase for the full quarter. For the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues were up 15% compared to the same period last year.
This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, they represent brief periods of time, and we caution against reading too much into them.
With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $1,460,000,000 to $1,525,000,000; income per share, $0.92 to $0.98. The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 10% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis or 7% on a reported basis before adjusting for billing day and currency drags and EPS growth of 21%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We ended the year with record results, and we continue to benefit from a very strong labor market. Companies are having trouble locating the talent they need, and Robert Half is expert at doing this work for them. We are experienced at helping our clients find and, more importantly, hire candidates with hard-to-find skill sets, many of whom will have competing offers from other employers. Our success is due to our personalized approach, something we have done well for 70 years.
I'd like to talk a little bit about the economy and how we view the current environment. If you look at Main Street, particularly the small and midsized companies that make up the majority of our staffing clients, they need people to continue growth in their businesses. According to NFIB research, business optimism remains near historically high levels for this group. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index, which also measures small business optimism, has recently shown a modest weakening in business confidence from a very high level, yet hiring plans remain robust. This tells us that small business owners are moving forward with hiring plans. In fact, the NFIB reported a record number of job openings last month. Not being able to fill these jobs fast enough is the biggest barrier to growth. 60% of business owners said they are hiring or trying to hire, and 90% of those reported few or no qualified applicants.
These are compelling statistics, and we believe they are evidence of a job market that is going to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Skill shortages are global, and we are confident we can be a valuable resource to companies as they navigate this tight market. It's one of the reasons we have invested heavily in developing our proprietary matching technology and laying the foundation for a world-class client and candidate experience online. But we believe you need a combination of technology and seasoned staffing professionals to be truly effective at finding and making the right match between client and job candidate. We are making digital investments, and we are making people investments to ensure we have the right mix of both.
Quarterly results for Protiviti also reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with how this business is performing. Financial services continues to be Protiviti's biggest industry sector. They are also putting greater focus on the technology sector. Protiviti's cybersecurity services remained strong during the quarter as did their wide range of internal audit and risk and compliance solutions, such as anti-money laundering services and work in the area of digital transformation. And we are optimistic about the successful go-to-market strategy with Protiviti and our staffing operations. We are providing a full spectrum of consulting, staff augmentation and managed services to our clients.
Now Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

As we've talked about for many quarters, we were led by Germany, Belgium. More recently, Canada and Australia have participated nicely. As to Protiviti, internationally, it's been very strong in Europe. It's strong in Australia. This quarter, it was also very strong in Canada. The interesting thing and the very nice thing, not only Protiviti international, Protiviti U.S. as well, is how broad-based across their solution offerings it is. It's internal audit, it's technology consulting, cyber privacy. It's also risk and compliance and financial services. So it's very broad-based by solution offering, and that's true both in the United States and in the U.S. As we talked about last quarter, we transferred some accounts that previously were in Management Resources on the staffing side, to Protiviti that gets adjusted for in the pro forma non-GAAP analysis that we provide. But absent that, Protiviti's growth rates are also quite strong. And I will add that in the International Zone for Protiviti as well as in the U.S., the go-to-market, together with staffing, also continues to be very robust and was a significant contributing factor to the outperformance that Protiviti had during the quarter."

So tax rate, first of all, for the quarter, the range is 25% to 26%, which is lower than a year ago because a year ago, we had an adjustment to the Tax Act, deferred tax valuation that is not expected to repeat. For the full year, I'd broaden that range to 25% to 27%, with kind of 26% being in the middle. CapEx, we're predicting $60 million to $70 million. That's up quite a bit from 2018. It's consistent with the run rate. We just reported $15 million in the fourth quarter, so the run rate is $60 million. I'd also add that if you look on a 10-year basis, on average, we've spent about 1.2% of revenue on CapEx. And at the high end of $70 million, we'd be at 1.1%. So while it's somewhat higher than '18, it's pretty much in line with our traditional range. Most of that additional spending is in the digital transformation area. As Max mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on improving our client and candidate digital experience, both on the web and with the mobile app. We're ever broadening our use of AI. We use it in recruiting for candidate discovery. We use it when we fill jobs with the matching engines. We use it in marketing where we micro target candidates and clients, where we individualize the message by candidate and by client. We use it in sales where we prioritize for our field staff the leads using our scoring engines. Remember that our algorithms are driven by proprietary data, which is based on post-placement performance. We analyze the candidates with the best outcomes, and we work backwards from there to determine our algorithms. We believe we have more accounting performance data than anybody on the planet that we use to inform those algorithms. That said, you still need human beings to assess soft skills, to assess attitude, professionalism, demeanor. And you still need human beings to close candidates that have multiple opportunities. It's a long-winded answer to a pretty short question, but the point is, the $60 million, $70 million is somewhat higher than the $42 million we spent in 2018."

First of all, temp gross margins, we expect the momentum we've seen with our pay/bill spreads to continue into the first quarter. We're thinking somewhere between 50 to 70 basis points increase year-over-year. Protiviti, the gross margins will be flat to down slightly because, remember, their staff gets their annual salary increases on January 1. And it takes some time over the course of the year to recover that, but that's ordinary. From the standpoint, was there anything unusual? So first of all, with workers comp, a year ago, we had $1 million credit. This year, we had virtually 0. We did have and we always have in the fourth quarter where we true up our estimates for state unemployment, federal unemployment, FICA, et cetera, so we did have a little, 20, 30 basis points, something in that range where we cleaned up all of those accruals and adjusted them to actual so that doesn't repeat into the first quarter. But again, that's very typical for the fourth quarter and the first quarter guidance. From an SG&A standpoint, as we talked about earlier, we'll continue to hire in line on headcount. Note that, overall, the SG&A percentage for staffing will go up, call it, 50, 60 basis points. Half of that's because of mix. With perm growing faster than temp, and with perm having a higher SG&A, significantly higher SG&A percentage, mix alone impacts the overall reported rate. But when you put everything together, SG&A as a percent of revenue for the company, first quarter ought to be in line with what it was a year ago, plus or minus 10 or 20 basis points either direction. So operating margins overall for the first quarter don't look that different than the fourth quarter, which means they would be up 30 to 50 basis points versus a year ago, which we're very happy with. We basically take a 7% -- at our midpoint, we take a 7% reported revenue increase to a 21% increase in earnings per share."

So frankly, that hasn't -- while there are digital-only, digital-first competitors, by and large, Protiviti's principal competitors are the Big 4. And what's different? Clearly, the go-to-market with staffing and Protiviti is different and more successful and more advanced, and success breeds success. Both the staffing organization and the Protiviti organization have totally bought into, we have something special, we have something no one else has under one roof. We have world-class consulting and world-class staffing. Nobody else has that. The clients understand it. The clients buy it. The clients benefit not only from a quality point of view but from a price point of view as well because by blending staffing in, the average hourly cost goes down. So I would give a big assist to their acceleration, to the go-to-market, the combined go-to-market, together with Protiviti having the confidence that they can sell engagements that they might have not the full-time internal staff for, that they have the confidence that they can find the staff on a just-in-time basis through our staffing organization, which also benefits the growth rates all across their service offerings. Having said that, as I spoke to earlier, it's not just about one of their service lines, it's internal audit. It's technology consulting, and it's financial services regulatory compliance. It's amazing how balanced it is, not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S. as well. So kudos to Protiviti. And it's not just Protiviti. Remember that we report revenue externally based on who has the contract with the client. So we have engagements where 80% of the hours are performed by our staffing organization, but what you see reported externally all shows up in Protiviti. And in fact, if you looked at the out performance in revenues for the quarter, at least based on our internal expectations, externally, it all says Protiviti.  But we know internally that 75% of that was performed by our staffing organization. And it's a beautiful thing because when it works together like that, it's almost magical."

That's not unusual. We've seen it in every cycle. We, as a management team, individually, have all been here over 30 years. We've seen this before. This is very normal. This is very typical.

Sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes that's not, but essentially no visibility. That hasn't changed. As far as customer sentiment, as we alluded to earlier from a confidence standpoint, whether it's NFIB, whether it's CEO Vista, there's many, many, many studies that says their sentiment is not quite what it was, but on an absolute basis, it's still quite high. But what's key for us and what's kind of not open for dispute is that the labor markets stay very strong. Supply and demand on the labor side is clearly still tight from a labor point of view. So our willingness to continue to invest in headcount, it's because we're in a very strong labor economy. And we can all debate interest rates, tariffs, China, the Fed, all of those are interesting discussion points but the point is, we're in a candidate-short market, not only in the United States but globally.

Now let's turn to Robert Half's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018. Company-wide revenues were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income per share in the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2017. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a onetime, noncash charge to our provision for income taxes related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount recorded was $34 million or $0.27 per share and resulted primarily from a revaluation of our deferred income tax net assets as of December 31, 2017. Excluding this charge, our net income per share was $0.65 for the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Accompanying the release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year net income and diluted net income growth on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. The term ""as-adjusted"" reflects the impact to our 2017 and 2018 provisions for income taxes, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Cash flow from operations was $123 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million in the fourth quarter. In December 2018, we distributed a total of $34 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.28 per share quarterly cash dividend. We also repurchased 2.4 million Robert Half shares in the fourth quarter at a cost of $137 million. We have 6.7 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We ended the year strongly with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income on both a quarterly and annual basis. Full year 2018 revenues and operating income reached all-time high levels for the company with broad-based strength in our staffing and Protiviti operations. 
U.S. labor market remains very robust, with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines. During the fourth quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.482 billion. This is up 10% from the year-ago period on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term ""as-adjusted,"" in this case, reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Fourth quarter total staffing revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $934 million, up 7% on a same-day basis. And non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 14% on an as-adjusted basis. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The fourth quarter had 61.7 billing days compared to 61.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. The current first quarter has 62.2 billing days compared to 63 billing days in the first quarter 1 year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $12 million in the fourth quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth by 1%.
Fourth quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $263 million with $204 million coming from business within the United States and $59 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 19% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while non-U.S. revenues were up 30% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.9%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 83 locations in 26 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin in the fourth quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues compared to 37.0% of applicable revenues in the same period 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees contributed significantly to the increase.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 120 basis points versus 1 year ago to 44.4%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin in the fourth quarter was $80 million or 30.2% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 30.0% of Protiviti revenues.
Fourth quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.5% of staffing revenues compared to 34.1% 1 year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's overall SG&A ratio. We ended 2018 with 14,900 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2018 with 4,700 full-time employees and contractors, up 18% from the prior year.
Fourth quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $120 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $102 million in operating income, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%.
In the fourth quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million. This was down 2% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 14.4%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 32% from the prior year's fourth quarter. This produced an operating margin of 12.9%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $794 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 48.1 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance for 2019, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of '18 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues up 6.7% versus the prior year compared to an 8% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 3 weeks of January were up 10% compared to January of 2018. December revenues for our permanent placement division were up 15.5% versus 2017 compared to 13.5% increase for the full quarter. For the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues were up 15% compared to the same period last year.
This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, they represent brief periods of time, and we caution against reading too much into them.
With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $1,460,000,000 to $1,525,000,000; income per share, $0.92 to $0.98. The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 10% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis or 7% on a reported basis before adjusting for billing day and currency drags and EPS growth of 21%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We ended the year with record results, and we continue to benefit from a very strong labor market. Companies are having trouble locating the talent they need, and Robert Half is expert at doing this work for them. We are experienced at helping our clients find and, more importantly, hire candidates with hard-to-find skill sets, many of whom will have competing offers from other employers. Our success is due to our personalized approach, something we have done well for 70 years.
I'd like to talk a little bit about the economy and how we view the current environment. If you look at Main Street, particularly the small and midsized companies that make up the majority of our staffing clients, they need people to continue growth in their businesses. According to NFIB research, business optimism remains near historically high levels for this group. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index, which also measures small business optimism, has recently shown a modest weakening in business confidence from a very high level, yet hiring plans remain robust. This tells us that small business owners are moving forward with hiring plans. In fact, the NFIB reported a record number of job openings last month. Not being able to fill these jobs fast enough is the biggest barrier to growth. 60% of business owners said they are hiring or trying to hire, and 90% of those reported few or no qualified applicants.
These are compelling statistics, and we believe they are evidence of a job market that is going to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Skill shortages are global, and we are confident we can be a valuable resource to companies as they navigate this tight market. It's one of the reasons we have invested heavily in developing our proprietary matching technology and laying the foundation for a world-class client and candidate experience online. But we believe you need a combination of technology and seasoned staffing professionals to be truly effective at finding and making the right match between client and job candidate. We are making digital investments, and we are making people investments to ensure we have the right mix of both.
Quarterly results for Protiviti also reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with how this business is performing. Financial services continues to be Protiviti's biggest industry sector. They are also putting greater focus on the technology sector. Protiviti's cybersecurity services remained strong during the quarter as did their wide range of internal audit and risk and compliance solutions, such as anti-money laundering services and work in the area of digital transformation. And we are optimistic about the successful go-to-market strategy with Protiviti and our staffing operations.

IZ versus domestic trends, while there was some slowing in Europe, it was slowing from a very high base with very tough comps. We still had double-digit growth in the International Zone, which actually exceeded the growth rate in the U.S. So we're still doing quite well internationally. As we've talked about for many quarters, we were led by Germany, Belgium. More recently, Canada and Australia have participated nicely. As to Protiviti, internationally, it's been very strong in Europe. It's strong in Australia. This quarter, it was also very strong in Canada. The interesting thing and the very nice thing, not only Protiviti international, Protiviti U.S. as well, is how broad-based across their solution offerings it is. It's internal audit, it's technology consulting, cyber privacy. It's also risk and compliance and financial services. So it's very broad-based by solution offering, and that's true both in the United States and in the U.S. As we talked about last quarter, we transferred some accounts that previously were in Management Resources on the staffing side, to Protiviti that gets adjusted for in the pro forma non-GAAP analysis that we provide. But absent that, Protiviti's growth rates are also quite strong. And I will add that in the International Zone for Protiviti as well as in the U.S., the go-to-market, together with staffing, also continues to be very robust and was a significant contributing factor to the outperformance that Protiviti had during the quarter."

So tax rate, first of all, for the quarter, the range is 25% to 26%, which is lower than a year ago because a year ago, we had an adjustment to the Tax Act, deferred tax valuation that is not expected to repeat. For the full year, I'd broaden that range to 25% to 27%, with kind of 26% being in the middle. CapEx, we're predicting $60 million to $70 million. That's up quite a bit from 2018. It's consistent with the run rate. We just reported $15 million in the fourth quarter, so the run rate is $60 million. I'd also add that if you look on a 10-year basis, on average, we've spent about 1.2% of revenue on CapEx. And at the high end of $70 million, we'd be at 1.1%. So while it's somewhat higher than '18, it's pretty much in line with our traditional range. Most of that additional spending is in the digital transformation area. As Max mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on improving our client and candidate digital experience, both on the web and with the mobile app. We're ever broadening our use of AI. We use it in recruiting for candidate discovery. We use it when we fill jobs with the matching engines. We use it in marketing where we micro target candidates and clients, where we individualize the message by candidate and by client. We use it in sales where we prioritize for our field staff the leads using our scoring engines. Remember that our algorithms are driven by proprietary data, which is based on post-placement performance. We analyze the candidates with the best outcomes, and we work backwards from there to determine our algorithms. We believe we have more accounting performance data than anybody on the planet that we use to inform those algorithms. That said, you still need human beings to assess soft skills, to assess attitude, professionalism, demeanor. And you still need human beings to close candidates that have multiple opportunities. It's a long-winded answer to a pretty short question, but the point is, the $60 million, $70 million is somewhat higher than the $42 million we spent in 2018."

First of all, temp gross margins, we expect the momentum we've seen with our pay/bill spreads to continue into the first quarter. We're thinking somewhere between 50 to 70 basis points increase year-over-year. Protiviti, the gross margins will be flat to down slightly because, remember, their staff gets their annual salary increases on January 1. And it takes some time over the course of the year to recover that, but that's ordinary. From the standpoint, was there anything unusual? So first of all, with workers comp, a year ago, we had $1 million credit. This year, we had virtually 0. We did have and we always have in the fourth quarter where we true up our estimates for state unemployment, federal unemployment, FICA, et cetera, so we did have a little, 20, 30 basis points, something in that range where we cleaned up all of those accruals and adjusted them to actual so that doesn't repeat into the first quarter. But again, that's very typical for the fourth quarter and the first quarter guidance. From an SG&A standpoint, as we talked about earlier, we'll continue to hire in line on headcount. Note that, overall, the SG&A percentage for staffing will go up, call it, 50, 60 basis points. Half of that's because of mix. With perm growing faster than temp, and with perm having a higher SG&A, significantly higher SG&A percentage, mix alone impacts the overall reported rate. But when you put everything together, SG&A as a percent of revenue for the company, first quarter ought to be in line with what it was a year ago, plus or minus 10 or 20 basis points either direction. So operating margins overall for the first quarter don't look that different than the fourth quarter, which means they would be up 30 to 50 basis points versus a year ago, which we're very happy with. We basically take a 7% -- at our midpoint, we take a 7% reported revenue increase to a 21% increase in earnings per share."

So very much a reflection of the tight labor market that played to our advantage for the reentry into this year. Protiviti, the seasonal pattern, Q4 to Q1, as is always the case, internal audits quite strong in Q4.  But in Q1, that gets crowded out to some degree as clients work with their external auditors to get their external audits done, and that has a seasonal impact on Protiviti.

Tech demand, broadly, is strong. It's cyber, it's cloud, it's digital transformation, both from a consulting and a IT operations point of view. We've talked in the past about how we broadened the focus of the positions we specialize in. That's played nicely and our revenue growth rates have responded accordingly. Further, we're having increasing success going to market in tech with both Protiviti and with staffing, where Protiviti manages the tech projects. And often, much of the staffing comes from Robert Half Technology. So a factor of all of those, we would expect the growth rates in technology, Robert Half Technology staffing, to continue to outpace the other lines of business."

So frankly, that hasn't -- while there are digital-only, digital-first competitors, by and large, Protiviti's principal competitors are the Big 4. And what's different? Clearly, the go-to-market with staffing and Protiviti is different and more successful and more advanced, and success breeds success. Both the staffing organization and the Protiviti organization have totally bought into, we have something special, we have something no one else has under one roof. We have world-class consulting and world-class staffing. Nobody else has that. The clients understand it. The clients buy it. The clients benefit not only from a quality point of view but from a price point of view as well because by blending staffing in, the average hourly cost goes down. So I would give a big assist to their acceleration, to the go-to-market, the combined go-to-market, together with Protiviti having the confidence that they can sell engagements that they might have not the full-time internal staff for, that they have the confidence that they can find the staff on a just-in-time basis through our staffing organization, which also benefits the growth rates all across their service offerings. Having said that, as I spoke to earlier, it's not just about one of their service lines, it's internal audit. It's technology consulting, and it's financial services regulatory compliance. It's amazing how balanced it is, not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S. as well. So kudos to Protiviti. And it's not just Protiviti. Remember that we report revenue externally based on who has the contract with the client. So we have engagements where 80% of the hours are performed by our staffing organization, but what you see reported externally all shows up in Protiviti. And in fact, if you looked at the out performance in revenues for the quarter, at least based on our internal expectations, externally, it all says Protiviti.  But we know internally that 75% of that was performed by our staffing organization. And it's a beautiful thing because when it works together like that, it's almost magical."

Again, as we've spoken to in the past, all you have to do is lose out on your first choice, then lose out on your second choice, settle on your third choice or settle for someone pretty significantly less experienced than you first hoped for, before you understand you have to pay more. That's not unusual. We've seen it in every cycle. We, as a management team, individually, have all been here over 30 years. We've seen this before. This is very normal. This is very typical.

As far as customer sentiment, as we alluded to earlier from a confidence standpoint, whether it's NFIB, whether it's CEO Vista, there's many, many, many studies that says their sentiment is not quite what it was, but on an absolute basis, it's still quite high. But what's key for us and what's kind of not open for dispute is that the labor markets stay very strong. Supply and demand on the labor side is clearly still tight from a labor point of view. So our willingness to continue to invest in headcount, it's because we're in a very strong labor economy.

Now I'd like to go over Robert Half's financial results for the first quarter. Company-wide revenues were $1,469,000,000. This is up 5% from last year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis. 
Net income per share for the quarter was $0.93 compared to $0.78 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 19%. Cash flow from operations was $127 million and capital expenditures were $13 million in the first quarter. In February of this year, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.28 to $0.31 per share and in March, we distributed that dividend to shareholders for a total cash outlay of $38 million. We also repurchased roughly 800,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $52 million. We have 5.9 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We saw a solid revenue growth in our staffing and Protiviti operations during the quarter, both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Persistent tight labor markets globally continued result in heightened demand for our professional staffing services. During the first quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 41%. I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed discussion of our results."

As just noted, global revenues in the first quarter were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from the prior year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period. Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both the reported and as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as-adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
For our staffing business, first quarter revenues were up 7% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $931 million, up 6% on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 11% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 62.2 billing days compared to 63 days in the first quarter of 2018. The shorter 2019 first quarter reduced our reported year-over-year staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days compared to 63.5 days in the second quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $22 million in the first quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.9 percentage points. 
For Protiviti, first quarter global revenues were $252 million with $192 million coming from business within the United States and $600 million -- excuse me, $60 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the first quarter while non-U.S. revenues were up 19% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effects of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $4 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.7 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 85 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin in the first quarter. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.0% of applicable revenues compared to 37.2% of applicable revenues in the same period 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees were the largest contributors to the increase. 
First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.8% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.2% of consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2018. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, the overall staffing gross margin increased 110 basis points versus 1 year ago to 44.7%. For Protiviti, gross margin in the first quarter was $64 million or 25.3% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $55 million or 26.4% of Protiviti revenues.
First quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.2% of staffing revenues compared to 33.5% 1 year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a a year ago added 30 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period.
First quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $128 million, up 7% from the first quarter of 2018. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary consulting and staffing divisions reported $106 million in operating income, an increase of 10% from the first quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.8%. 
In the first quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $22 million. This was down 4% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 16.4%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million in the first quarter, an increase of 22% from the year ago period has produced an operating margin of 7.4%. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $826 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 50.5 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter of '19 and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days. At temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues up 4.7% versus the prior year compared to 6.2% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of April were 3.7% compared to the same period in April of 2018.
March revenues for our permanent placement division were up 16.1% versus 2018 compared to 12.3% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were up 6.3% compared to the same period last year. This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the first quarter and thus far in April. But as you know, they represent brief periods of time, and we caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.485 billion to $1.550 billion; income per share, $0.95 to $1.01.
The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5% on the same day as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 10%. We limit our guidance to one quarter. 
All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We ended the quarter with a solid revenue growth throughout our staffing operations and Protiviti. Current trends leave us optimistic about where the company is positioned. Last year, the economy produced 2.7 million new jobs, and March 2019 BLS report showed job gains of nearly 200,000, exceeding economists' estimates. Our key staff and client base of small and midsized businesses is feeling the pinch of the NFID's March jobs report showed that 60% of small medium-sized business owners are either hiring or trying to hire and their biggest business problem is the lack of available skilled talent. Increasingly, they are turning to Robert Half for help.
We are also seeing wage increases start to materialize as more employers recognize that they need to pay more to get the candidates they want. Wage inflation trends are now more typical of those we've seen in past tight labor markets. Our brands are among the staffing and consulting world's most recognized and respected. Our financial position is strong, and we have the most experienced field and corporate management teams in the industry. The combination of technology and personal service we bring to market is key, and all our people and technology investments are designed to offer an optimal mix of high tech and high touch. We are convinced that you can't have one without the other and still provide clients with the type of hiring assistance they need.
With respect to Protiviti, we believe their leadership and talent have made them a formidable competitor and consulting. Their suite of consulting offerings now includes risk and compliance, data and analytics and performance improvement among others. Protiviti is also putting more focus and technology consulting, with additional emphasis on cyber security, cloud computing and digital transformation. As noted on prior calls, we are actively marketing our full suite of staffing and Protiviti capabilities and a managed solutions model. We believe our ability as a single provider to offer clients project oversight and deliverables, deep subject matter expertise and the scalable network of experienced interim staff is unique in our industry.
Now Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And so first of all, as you know, the comps certainly got tougher as we progress through the quarter. Further in Europe, we saw macro slowing in Germany, Belgium, France, a little beyond what we had expected. In the United States, particularly for Accountemps and OfficeTeam, we saw clients get more selective either because they were replacing attrition and we're looking for people to essentially hire on a full-time basis, ultimately, which made them more spec-driven than they might otherwise have been, and then we further saw their demand being more measured as we progress through the quarter. That said, we had double-digit growth in permanent Management Resources and intact that were all quite strong throughout the quarter. As to the first couple of weeks and relative to the exit, so first of all, for perm post quarter, if you look at year ago, we had monster comps during that same short period where were grew 25% year-on-year so I would discount the post quarter perm for that reason. If you look to post quarter temp just in the United States, it actually accelerated versus the exit rate in the first quarter in the U.S. It's non-U.S. that cause the overall reduction in the post-quarter growth rate versus the prior quarter and the exit rate and again, that was principally Europe. But again, to put everything in context, for the quarter just ended, we did grow 9% year-on-year not withstand tougher comps. We did grow EPS 19%. For the guidance we've given for the second quarter, we still expect 5% 6% at midpoint revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, which in this environment isn't bad."

That's because it's quite typical that our field people would somewhat front end their hiring for the year so we expect as the year progresses that perm margins will expand as well, which is embedded in our second quarter guidance. So headcount in line with top line growth. We've got some of our divisions growing nicely at double-digit rates. Those we will continue to feed with additional headcount. Those that are growing less will get less headcount. Protiviti is our fastest grower, and the largest contributor of Protiviti's growth are these joint solutions with staffing, as Max talked about. We have this unique offering aware for Protiviti, you get project oversight, you get deep subject matter expertise to get deliverables for staffing, you get scalable experience in staff. That's the largest portion of Protiviti's growth that continues to get traction we're very excited about that. While 75% to 80% of the staff come from the staffing divisions, 100% of the revenues get reported by Protiviti because it has the contract with the client. But again, it's a joint effort. We're getting more traction and it's the largest single contributor to Protiviti's growth during the quarter, which we're quite pleased with not that it was our only source of growth and in fact if you just look at Protiviti it remains very balanced between internal audit, technology consulting and financial services risk and compliance consulting."

It takes longer to recruit fee-eligible candidates and once you get them on assignment, because many of them want full-time employment, they find full-time employment more quickly than they do at other points in the cycle, which means we are then obliged to backfill for them. This quarter, as I spoke earlier at that same time as clients have gotten more selective, it just puts more pressure on that. And to the extent client attrition is driving temp demand, there more selective yet again when they are looking to replace full time, the attrition that they're seeing more of because of the tight labor market. So it's not a surprise that volumes are pressured as the labor market tightens, and that's very consistent with the past. And one could argue that the labor markets never been tighter than it is as we speak so that when you do have a feeling eligible candidate and when you place them, you charge more for them. That's why our bill rates are accelerating into a range more typical of what we see in a tight labor market."

But also understand that many of these projects are sold by people from our staffing divisions where we have more distribution because of the number of locations and the number of people.

And now the capability to a Protiviti on the field with their subject matter experts, our staffing people are starting to think through, ""Gee whiz, this order for one person is really symptomatic of a larger project opportunity,"" and therefore Protiviti comes in and jointly, they handle it. So the point is it's not like this is totally handled by dedicated Salesforce that we're adding location by location by location. Not at all.

Now our tax rate for the second quarter jumps up to 28%, 28.5%. We lose some of the stock deductions you get in the first quarter because that's when our stocks vest.

So first of all, most of them are focused on permanent placement rather than temp and consulting and permanent placement is one of our strongest businesses as we speak. And frankly, the biggest challenge there is what we call closing candidates where you're trying to get a candidate to take the position in discussion rather than to hold out for you to better position and as labor consultants because that's what our people do all day, they have a much better perspective on the market than any one person can have and many times, it's that consulting our people do with candidates that gets them over the hook. And that activity that happened with the online perm competitors. As far as impact on candidates, again, while there are platforms they could go to, they need to be convinced, they need to be nudged further with our clients. Many of them are not household names so part of what value our people add is they sell these not household names. They sell those opportunities in ways that the client themselves couldn't do. So they add value there as well. So we don't see an and outflow of candidates to platforms having a major impact on supply. And in fact as I said earlier, if anything, we see our own technology initiatives benefiting supply and frankly disproportionately so at least to our traditional competitors and we don't see much linkage to nontraditional competitors in that way."

Further, do they choose a staffing contractor or did they choose one of their own staff that's already on the payroll?

Now I'd like to go over Robert Half's financial results for the first quarter. Company-wide revenues were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from last year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis. 
Net income per share for the quarter was $0.93 compared to $0.78 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 19%. Cash flow from operations was $127 million, and capital expenditures were $13 million in the first quarter. In February of this year, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.28 to $0.31 per share, and in March, we distributed that dividend to shareholders for a total cash outlay of $38 million. We also repurchased roughly 800,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $52 million. We have 5.9 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid revenue growth in our staffing and Protiviti operations during the quarter, both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Persistent tight labor markets globally continue to result in heightened demand for our professional staffing services. 
During the first quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 41%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed discussion of our results."

This is up 5% from the prior year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period. Accompanying our e",952,"Thank you, Max. 
As just noted, global revenues in the first quarter were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from the prior year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period. 
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and an as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as-adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
For our staffing business, first quarter revenues were up 7% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $931 million, up 6% on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 11% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 62.2 billing days compared to 63 days in the first quarter of 2018. The shorter 2019 first quarter reduced our reported year-over-year staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days compared to 63.5 days in the second quarter 1 year ago. 
Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $22 million in the first quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.9 percentage points. 
For Protiviti, first quarter global revenues were $252 million, with $192 million coming from business within the United States and $600 million -- excuse me, $60 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. 
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the first quarter while non-U.S. revenues were up 19% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effects of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $4 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.7 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 85 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin in the first quarter. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.0% of applicable revenues compared to 37.2% of applicable revenues in the same period 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees were the largest contributors to the increase. 
First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.8% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.2% of consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2018. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, the overall staffing gross margin increased 110 basis points versus 1 year ago to 44.7%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin in the first quarter was $64 million or 25.3% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $55 million or 26.4% of Protiviti revenues.
First quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.2% of staffing revenues compared to 33.5% 1 year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 30 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period.
First quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $128 million, up 7% from the first quarter of 2018. Operating margin was 10.5%. 
Our temporary and consulting and staffing divisions reported $106 million in operating income, an increase of 10% from the first quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.8%. 
In the first quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $22 million. This was down 4% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 16.4%. 
Operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million in the first quarter, an increase of 22% from the year ago period. This produced an operating margin of 7.4%. 
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $826 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 50.5 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter of '19, and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days. 
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues up 4.7% versus the prior year compared to a 6.2% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of April were 3.7% compared to the same period in April of 2018.
March revenues for our permanent placement division were up 16.1% versus 2018 compared to a 12.3% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were up 6.3% compared to the same period last year. 
This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the first quarter and thus far in April, but as you know, they represent brief periods of time and we caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.485 billion to $1.550 billion; income per share, $0.95 to $1.01.
The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5% on the same day as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti, and EPS growth of 10%. 
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We ended the quarter with a solid revenue growth throughout our staffing operations and Protiviti. 
Current trends leave us optimistic about where the company is positioned. Last year, the economy produced 2.7 million new jobs. The March 2019 BLS report showed job gains of nearly 200,000, exceeding economists' estimates. 
Our key staffing client base of small and midsized businesses is feeling the pinch. The NFIB's March jobs report showed that 60% of small and medium-sized business owners are either hiring or trying to hire, and their biggest business problem is a lack of available skilled talent. Increasingly, they are turning to Robert Half for help.
We are also seeing wage increases start to materialize as more employers recognize that they need to pay more to get the candidates they want. Wage inflation trends are now more typical of those we've seen in past tight labor markets. 
Our brands are among the staffing and consulting world's most recognized and respected, our financial position is strong, and we have the most experienced field and corporate management teams in the industry. 
The combination of technology and personal service we bring to market is key, and all of our people and technology investments are designed to offer an optimal mix of high-tech and high-touch. We are convinced that you can't have one without the other and still provide clients with the type of hiring assistance they need.
With respect to Protiviti, we believe their leadership and talent have made them a formidable competitor in consulting. Their suite of consulting offerings now includes risk and compliance, data and analytics, and performance improvement among others. Protiviti is also putting more focus and technology consulting, with additional emphasis on cyber security, cloud computing and digital transformation. 
As noted on prior calls, we are actively marketing our full suite of staffing and Protiviti capabilities in a managed solutions model. We believe our ability as a single provider to offer clients project oversight and deliverables, deep subject matter expertise and a scalable network of experienced interim staff is unique in our industry.
Now Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And so first of all, as you know, the comps certainly got tougher as we progressed through the quarter. Further, in Europe, we saw macro slowing in Germany, Belgium, France, a little beyond what we had expected. In the United States, particularly for Accountemps and OfficeTeam, we saw clients get more selective, either because they were replacing attrition and were looking for people to essentially hire on a full-time basis ultimately, which made them more spec-driven than they might otherwise have been. And we further saw their demand being more measured as we progressed through the quarter. That said, we had double-digit growth in perm, in Management Resources and in tech that were all quite strong throughout the quarter. As to the first couple of weeks and relative to the exit, so first of all, for perm post quarter, if you look at year ago, we had monster comps during that same short period where we grew 25% year-on-year so I would discount the post-quarter perm for that reason. If you looked at post-quarter temp just in the United States, it actually accelerated versus the exit rate in the first quarter in the U.S. It's non-U.S. that caused the overall reduction in the post-quarter growth rate versus the prior quarter and the exit rate. And again, that was principally Europe. But again, to put everything in context, for the quarter just ended, we did grow 9% year-on-year notwithstanding tougher comps. We did grow EPS 19%. For the guidance we've given for the second quarter, we still expect 5% or 6% at midpoint revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, which in this environment isn't bad."

You'll note that perm margins were slightly lower year-on-year in Q1. That's because it's quite typical that our field people would somewhat front end their hiring for the year. So we expect as the year progresses that perm margins would expand as well which is embedded in our second quarter guidance. So headcount, in line with top line growth. We've got some of our divisions growing nicely at double-digit rates. Those we will continue to feed with additional headcount. Those that are growing less will get less headcount. Protiviti is our fastest grower. And the largest contributor to Protiviti's growth are these joint solutions with staffing. As Max talked about, we have this unique offering ware for Protiviti. You get project oversight. You get deep subject matter expertise. You get deliverables. And then from staffing, you get scalable, experienced staff. That's the largest portion of Protiviti's growth that continues to get traction. We're very excited about that. While 75% to 80% of the staff come from the staffing divisions, 100% of the revenues get reported by Protiviti because it has the contract with the client. But again, it's a joint effort, we're getting more traction, and it's the largest single contributor to Protiviti's growth during the quarter, which we're quite pleased with. Not that it was our only source of growth. And in fact, if you just looked at Protiviti, it remains very balanced between internal audit, technology consulting and financial services, risk and compliance consulting."

Weekly unemployment claims, quite low, quite good. JOLTS, mostly good. Although openings were down a bit. PMI services that came out last week were negative.

And to the extent client attrition is driving temp demand, they are more selective yet again when they're looking to replace full time the attrition that they're seeing more of because of the tight labor market. So it's not a surprise that volumes are pressured as the labor market tightens, and that's very consistent with the past.

So first of all, most of them are focused on permanent placement rather than temp and consulting, and permanent placement is one of our strongest businesses as we speak. And frankly, the biggest challenge there is what we call closing candidates where you're trying to get a candidate to take the position in discussion rather than to hold out for yet a better position. And as labor consultants, because that's what our people do all day, they have a much better perspective on the market than any one person can have, and many times, it's that consulting our people do with candidates that gets them over the hump. And that activity doesn't happen with the online perm competitors. As far as impact on candidates, again, while there are platforms they can go to, they need to be convinced. They need to be nudged further with our clients. Many of them are not household names. So part of what value our people add is they sell these non-household names. They sell those opportunities in ways that the client themselves couldn't do. So they add value there as well. So we don't see an outflow of candidates to platforms having a major impact on supply. And in fact, as I said earlier, if anything, we see our own technology initiatives benefiting supply, and frankly disproportionately so, at least to our traditional competitors, and we don't see much linkage to nontraditional competitors in that way."

Utilization or chargeability, how many hours is a person on an account versus non-chargeable. They manage that. Further, do they choose a staffing contractor or did they choose one of their own staff that's already on the payroll? That's another way they manage their gross margin. So there's a lot of levers there that they have to deal with. They're quite astute in managing those levers and how they impact their gross margin. They're also very astute, and they understand.

Now I'd like to go over Robert Half's financial results for the first quarter. Company-wide revenues were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from last year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis. 
Net income per share for the quarter was $0.93 compared to $0.78 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 19%. Cash flow from operations was $127 million, and capital expenditures were $13 million in the first quarter. In February of this year, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.28 to $0.31 per share, and in March, we distributed that dividend to shareholders for a total cash outlay of $38 million. We also repurchased roughly 800,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $52 million. We have 5.9 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid revenue growth in our staffing and Protiviti operations during the quarter, both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Persistent tight labor markets globally continue to result in heightened demand for our professional staffing services. 
During the first quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 41%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed discussion of our results."

This is up 5% from the prior year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period. Accompanying our e",950,"Thank you, Max. 
As just noted, global revenues in the first quarter were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from the prior year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period. 
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and an as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as-adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
For our staffing business, first quarter revenues were up 7% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $931 million, up 6% on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 11% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 62.2 billing days compared to 63 days in the first quarter of 2018. The shorter 2019 first quarter reduced our reported year-over-year staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days compared to 63.5 days in the second quarter 1 year ago. 
Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $22 million in the first quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.9 percentage points. 
For Protiviti, first quarter global revenues were $252 million, with $192 million coming from business within the United States and $600 million -- excuse me, $60 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. 
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the first quarter while non-U.S. revenues were up 19% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effects of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $4 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.7 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 85 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin in the first quarter. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.0% of applicable revenues compared to 37.2% of applicable revenues in the same period 1 year ago.  Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees were the largest contributors to the increase. 
First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.8% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.2% of consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2018. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, the overall staffing gross margin increased 110 basis points versus 1 year ago to 44.7%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin in the first quarter was $64 million or 25.3% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $55 million or 26.4% of Protiviti revenues.
First quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.2% of staffing revenues compared to 33.5% 1 year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 30 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period.
First quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $128 million, up 7% from the first quarter of 2018. Operating margin was 10.5%. 
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $106 million in operating income, an increase of 10% from the first quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.8%. 
In the first quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $22 million. This was down 4% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 16.4%. 
Operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million in the first quarter, an increase of 22% from the year ago period. This produced an operating margin of 7.4%. 
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $826 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 50.5 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter of '19, and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days. 
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues up 4.7% versus the prior year compared to 6.2% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of April were 3.7% compared to the same period in April of 2018.
March revenues for our permanent placement division were up 16.1% versus 2018 compared to a 12.3% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were up 6.3% compared to the same period last year. 
This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the first quarter and thus far in April, but as you know, they represent brief periods of time and we caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.485 billion to $1.550 billion; income per share, $0.95 to $1.01.
The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5% on a same day as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti, and EPS growth of 10%. 
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We ended the quarter with solid revenue growth throughout our staffing operations and Protiviti. 
Current trends leave us optimistic about where the company is positioned. Last year, the economy produced 2.7 million new jobs. The March 2019 BLS report showed job gains of nearly 200,000, exceeding economists' estimates. 
Our key staffing client base of small and midsized businesses is feeling the pinch. The NFIB's March jobs report showed that 60% of small and medium-sized business owners are either hiring or trying to hire, and their biggest business problem is a lack of available skilled talent. Increasingly, they are turning to Robert Half for help.
We are also seeing wage increases start to materialize as more employers recognize that they need to pay more to get the candidates they want. Wage inflation trends are now more typical of those we've seen in past tight labor markets. 
Our brands are among the staffing and consulting world's most recognized and respected, our financial position is strong, and we have the most experienced field and corporate management teams in the industry. 
The combination of technology and personal service we bring to market is key, and all our people and technology investments are designed to offer an optimal mix of high-tech and high-touch. We are convinced that you can't have one without the other and still provide clients with the type of hiring assistance they need.
With respect to Protiviti, we believe their leadership and talent have made them a formidable competitor in consulting. Their suite of consulting offerings now includes risk and compliance, data and analytics, and performance improvement among others. Protiviti is also putting more focus on technology consulting, with additional emphasis on cyber security, cloud computing and digital transformation. 
As noted on prior calls, we are actively marketing our full suite of staffing and Protiviti capabilities in a managed solutions model. We believe our ability as a single provider to offer clients project oversight and deliverables, deep subject matter expertise and a scalable network of experienced interim staff is unique in our industry.

And so first of all, as you know, the comps certainly got tougher as we progressed through the quarter. Further, in Europe, we saw macro slowing in Germany, Belgium, France, a little beyond what we had expected. In the United States, particularly for Accountemps and OfficeTeam, we saw clients get more selective, either because they were replacing attrition and were looking for people to essentially hire on a full-time basis ultimately, which made them more spec-driven than they might otherwise have been. And we further saw their demand being more measured as we progressed through the quarter. That said, we had double-digit growth in perm, in Management Resources and in tech that were all quite strong throughout the quarter. As to the first couple of weeks and relative to the exit, so first of all, for perm post quarter, if you look a year ago, we had monster comps during that same short period where we grew 25% year-on-year so I would discount the post-quarter perm for that reason. If you looked at post-quarter temp, just in the United States, it actually accelerated versus the exit rate in the first quarter in the U.S. It's non-U.S. that caused the overall reduction in the post-quarter growth rate versus the prior quarter and the exit rate. And again, that was principally Europe. But again, to put everything in context, for the quarter just ended, we did grow 9% year-on-year notwithstand tougher comps. We did grow EPS 19%. For the guidance we've given for the second quarter, we still expect 5% or 6% at midpoint revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, which in this environment isn't bad."

You'll note that perm margins were slightly lower year-on-year in Q1. That's because it's quite typical that our field people would somewhat front end their hiring for the year. So we expect as the year progresses that perm margins would expand as well which is embedded in our second quarter guidance. So headcount, in line with top line growth. We've got some of our divisions growing nicely at double-digit rates. Those we will continue to feed with additional headcount. Those that are growing less will get less headcount. Protiviti is our fastest grower. And the largest contributor to Protiviti's growth are these joint solutions with staffing. As Max talked about, we have this unique offering where, for Protiviti, you get project oversight. You get deep subject matter expertise. You get deliverables. And then from staffing, you get scalable, experienced staff. That's the largest portion of Protiviti's growth that continues to get traction. We're very excited about that. While 75% to 80% of the staff come from the staffing divisions, 100% of the revenues get reported by Protiviti because it has the contract with the client. But again, it's a joint effort, we're getting more traction, and it's the largest single contributor to Protiviti's growth during the quarter, which we're quite pleased with.

That's why our bill rates are accelerating into a range more typical of what we see in a tight labor market."

It's certainly a 1 or a 2 or a 3. It's nothing beyond that. But also understand that many of these projects are sold by people from our staffing divisions where we have more distribution because of the number of locations and the number of people. When there's a client need for a temporary, there's often a root cause which results in a project if you're thinking that way. And now with the capability to whistle Protiviti on the field with their subject matter experts, our staffing people are starting to think through, ""Gee whiz, this order for one person is really symptomatic of a larger project opportunity."" And therefore, Protiviti comes in and jointly they handle it. So the point is it's not like this is totally handled by a dedicated sales force that we're adding location by location by location. Not at all. What it is, is educating our existing staff to be more mindful of project opportunities that they ultimately benefit from themselves because they participate in the project revenue to a greater extent than they would had they just placed that one temporary on assignment."

Now we use AI in our discovery of candidates. We use AI in our outreach to candidates. We use AI in our matching candidates to orders. So I believe we're getting the most with what we have in large part because of our technology investments which have been significant, but that doesn't change that it's a tight labor market.

As we said, we're encouraged by our U.S. temp start is better than our exit. We're practical as it comes to reality as it relates to Europe so we've continued those trends.

But we have assumed that the trends where our U.S. AT/OT clients stay more measured and selective but that our Management Resources, technology, permanent placement, and Protiviti businesses all continue to grow nicely in double digits; that our margins, our operating margins actually expand on the staffing side 20 to 40 basis points; on the Protiviti side, 10 to 30 basis points. Now our tax rate for the second quarter jumps up to 28%, 28.5%. We lose some of the stock deductions you get in the first quarter because that's when our stock vests. Further, there are some expenses that become nondeductible with the new Tax Act, both of which give you a higher tax rate, 20% to 28.5%, which is up pretty significantly at least sequentially, and up 100 basis points versus a year ago. So when you put the package together, profitability actually improves year-on-year and sequentially, and growth, notwithstanding tougher comps, is mid-singles."

So first of all, most of them are focused on permanent placement rather than temp and consulting, and permanent placement is one of our strongest businesses as we speak. And frankly, the biggest challenge there is what we call closing candidates where you're trying to get a candidate to take the position in discussion rather than to hold out for yet a better position. And as labor consultants, because that's what our people do all day, they have a much better perspective on the market than any one person can have, and many times, it's that consulting our people do with candidates that gets them over the hump. And that activity doesn't happen with the online perm competitors. The -- as far as impact on candidates, again, while there are platforms they can go to, they need to be convinced. They need to be nudged further, with our clients, many of them are not household names. So part of what value our people add is they sell these non-household names. They sell those opportunities in ways that the client themselves couldn't do. So they add value there as well. So we don't see an outflow of candidates to platforms having a major impact on supply. And in fact, as I said earlier, if anything, we see our own technology initiatives benefiting supply, and frankly disproportionately so, at least to our traditional competitors, and we don't see much leakage to nontraditional competitors in that way."

Utilization or chargeability, how many hours is a person on an account versus not chargeable. They manage that. Further, do they choose a staffing contractor or did they choose one of their own staff that's already on the payroll? That's another way they manage their gross margin. So there's a lot of levers there that they have to deal with. They're quite astute in managing those levers and how they impact their gross margin. They're also very astute, and they understand.

Now I'd like to go over Robert Half's financial results for the first quarter. Company-wide revenues were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from last year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis. 
Net income per share for the quarter was $0.93 compared to $0.78 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 19%. Cash flow from operations was $127 million, and capital expenditures were $13 million in the first quarter. In February of this year, we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.28 to $0.31 per share, and in March, we distributed that dividend to shareholders for a total cash outlay of $38 million. We also repurchased roughly 800,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $52 million. We have 5.9 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid revenue growth in our staffing and Protiviti operations during the quarter, both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Persistent tight labor markets globally continue to result in heightened demand for our professional staffing services. 
During the first quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 41%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed discussion of our results."

As just noted, global revenues in the first quarter were $1.469 billion. This is up 5% from the prior year's first quarter on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period. 
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and an as-adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as-adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
For our staffing business, first quarter revenues were up 7% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $931 million, up 6% on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $285 million, up 11% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 62.2 billing days compared to 63 days in the first quarter of 2018. The shorter 2019 first quarter reduced our reported year-over-year staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days compared to 63.5 days in the second quarter 1 year ago. 
Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $22 million in the first quarter, which reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.9 percentage points. 
For Protiviti, first quarter global revenues were $252 million, with $192 million coming from business within the United States and $600 million -- excuse me, $60 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. 
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the first quarter while non-U.S. revenues were up 19% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effects of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $4 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.7 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 85 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin in the first quarter. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.0% of applicable revenues compared to 37.2% of applicable revenues in the same period 1 year ago.  Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees were the largest contributors to the increase. 
First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.8% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.2% of consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2018. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, the overall staffing gross margin increased 110 basis points versus 1 year ago to 44.7%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin in the first quarter was $64 million or 25.3% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $55 million or 26.4% of Protiviti revenues.
First quarter staffing SG&A costs were 34.2% of staffing revenues compared to 33.5% 1 year ago. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 30 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period.
First quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $128 million, up 7% from the first quarter of 2018. Operating margin was 10.5%. 
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $106 million in operating income, an increase of 10% from the first quarter of last year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.8%. 
In the first quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $22 million. This was down 4% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 16.4%. 
Operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million in the first quarter, an increase of 22% from the year ago period. This produced an operating margin of 7.4%. 
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $826 million, and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 50.5 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter of '19, and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days. 
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues up 4.7% versus the prior year compared to 6.2% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of April were 3.7% compared to the same period in April of 2018.
March revenues for our permanent placement division were up 16.1% versus 2018 compared to a 12.3% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were up 6.3% compared to the same period last year. 
This information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the first quarter and thus far in April, but as you know, they represent brief periods of time and we caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.485 billion to $1.550 billion; income per share, $0.95 to $1.01.
The midpoint of our first quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti, and EPS growth of 10%. 
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We ended the quarter with solid revenue growth throughout our staffing operations and Protiviti. 
Current trends leave us optimistic about where the company is positioned. Last year, the economy produced 2.7 million new jobs. The March 2019 BLS report showed job gains of nearly 200,000, exceeding economists' estimates. 
Our key staffing client base of small and midsized businesses is feeling the pinch. The NFIB's March jobs report showed that 60% of small and medium-sized business owners are either hiring or trying to hire, and their biggest business problem is a lack of available skilled talent. Increasingly, they are turning to Robert Half for help.
We are also seeing wage increases start to materialize as more employers recognize that they need to pay more to get the candidates they want. Wage inflation trends are now more typical of those we've seen in past tight labor markets. 
Our brands are among the staffing and consulting world's most recognized and respected, our financial position is strong, and we have the most experienced field and corporate management teams in the industry. 
The combination of technology and personal service we bring to market is key, and all our people and technology investments are designed to offer an optimal mix of high-tech and high-touch. We are convinced that you can't have one without the other and still provide clients with the type of hiring assistance they need.
With respect to Protiviti, we believe their leadership and talent have made them a formidable competitor in consulting. Their suite of consulting offerings now includes risk and compliance, data and analytics, and performance improvement among others. Protiviti is also putting more focus on technology consulting, with additional emphasis on cyber security, cloud computing and digital transformation. 
As noted on prior calls, we are actively marketing our full suite of staffing and Protiviti capabilities in a managed solutions model. We believe our ability as a single provider to offer clients project oversight and deliverables, deep subject matter expertise and a scalable network of experienced interim staff is unique in our industry.
Now Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And so first of all, as you know, the comps certainly got tougher as we progressed through the quarter. Further, in Europe, we saw macro slowing in Germany, Belgium, France, a little beyond what we had expected. In the United States, particularly for Accountemps and OfficeTeam, we saw clients get more selective, either because they were replacing attrition and were looking for people to essentially hire on a full-time basis ultimately, which made them more spec-driven than they might otherwise have been. And we further saw their demand being more measured as we progressed through the quarter. That said, we had double-digit growth in perm, in Management Resources and in tech that were all quite strong throughout the quarter. As to the first couple of weeks and relative to the exit, so first of all, for perm post quarter, if you look a year ago, we had monster comps during that same short period where we grew 25% year-on-year so I would discount the post-quarter perm for that reason. If you looked at post-quarter temp, just in the United States, it actually accelerated versus the exit rate in the first quarter in the U.S. It's non-U.S. that caused the overall reduction in the post-quarter growth rate versus the prior quarter and the exit rate. And again, that was principally Europe. But again, to put everything in context, for the quarter just ended, we did grow 9% year-on-year notwithstand tougher comps. We did grow EPS 19%. For the guidance we've given for the second quarter, we still expect 5% or 6% at midpoint revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, which in this environment isn't bad."

You'll note that perm margins were slightly lower year-on-year in Q1. That's because it's quite typical that our field people would somewhat front end their hiring for the year. So we expect as the year progresses that perm margins would expand as well which is embedded in our second quarter guidance. So headcount, in line with top line growth. We've got some of our divisions growing nicely at double-digit rates. Those we will continue to feed with additional headcount. Those that are growing less will get less headcount. Protiviti is our fastest grower. And the largest contributor to Protiviti's growth are these joint solutions with staffing. As Max talked about, we have this unique offering where, for Protiviti, you get project oversight. You get deep subject matter expertise. You get deliverables. And then from staffing, you get scalable, experienced staff. That's the largest portion of Protiviti's growth that continues to get traction. We're very excited about that. While 75% to 80% of the staff come from the staffing divisions, 100% of the revenues get reported by Protiviti because it has the contract with the client. But again, it's a joint effort, we're getting more traction, and it's the largest single contributor to Protiviti's growth during the quarter, which we're quite pleased with. Not that it was our only source of growth. And in fact, if you just looked at Protiviti, it remains very balanced between internal audit, technology consulting and financial services, risk and compliance consulting."

It takes longer to recruit fee-eligible candidates. And once you get them on assignment, because many of them want full-time employment, they find full-time employment more quickly than they do at other points in the cycle, which means we are then obliged to backfill for them. This quarter, as I spoke to earlier, at that same time as clients have gotten more selective, it just puts more pressure on that. And to the extent client attrition is driving temp demand, they are more selective yet again when they're looking to replace full time the attrition that they're seeing more of because of the tight labor market. So it's not a surprise that volumes are pressured as the labor market tightens, and that's very consistent with the past. And one could argue that the labor market's never been tighter than it is as we speak. So that when you do have a fee-eligible candidate and when you place them, you charge more for them. That's why our bill rates are accelerating into a range more typical of what we see in a tight labor market."

And therefore, Protiviti comes in and jointly they handle it. So the point is it's not like this is totally handled by a dedicated sales force that we're adding location by location by location.

Now our tax rate for the second quarter jumps up to 28%, 28.5%. We lose some of the stock deductions you get in the first quarter because that's when our stock vests. Further, there are some expenses that become nondeductible with the new Tax Act, both of which give you a higher tax rate, 20% to 28.5%, which is up pretty significantly at least sequentially, and up 100 basis points versus a year ago.

So first of all, most of them are focused on permanent placement rather than temp and consulting, and permanent placement is one of our strongest businesses as we speak. And frankly, the biggest challenge there is what we call closing candidates where you're trying to get a candidate to take the position in discussion rather than to hold out for yet a better position. And as labor consultants, because that's what our people do all day, they have a much better perspective on the market than any one person can have, and many times, it's that consulting our people do with candidates that gets them over the hump. And that activity doesn't happen with the online perm competitors. The -- as far as impact on candidates, again, while there are platforms they can go to, they need to be convinced. They need to be nudged further, with our clients, many of them are not household names. So part of what value our people add is they sell these non-household names. They sell those opportunities in ways that the client themselves couldn't do. So they add value there as well. So we don't see an outflow of candidates to platforms having a major impact on supply. And in fact, as I said earlier, if anything, we see our own technology initiatives benefiting supply, and frankly disproportionately so, at least to our traditional competitors, and we don't see much leakage to nontraditional competitors in that way."

Utilization or chargeability, how many hours is a person on an account versus not chargeable. They manage that. Further, do they choose a staffing contractor or did they choose one of their own staff that's already on the payroll? That's another way they manage their gross margin.

Now let's review Robert Half's financial results for the second quarter. Global revenues for the company were $1,516,000,000, an increase of 4% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and an increase of 6% on a same-day constant currency basis. Second quarter net income per share was $0.98 versus $0.89 in the same period 1 year ago. This is an increase of 10% year-over-year.
Cash flow from operations was $121 million in the second quarter and capital expenditures were $16 million. In June, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $60 million. We have 4.9 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid demand for our staffing and Protiviti services during the second quarter. Global talent shortages persist across our professional disciplines, particularly in the United States where unemployment remains near a 50-year low. This enhances the value of our services. During the second quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%. I'll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed discussion."

As noted, global revenues in the second quarter were $1.516 billion. This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year-ago period.Accompanying our earning",899,"Thank you, Max. As noted, global revenues in the second quarter were $1.516 billion. This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year-ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
On an as adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $965 million, up 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $278 million, up 3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
There were 63.4 billing days in the second quarter versus 63.5 in the same quarter 1 year ago. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 63.3 days in the third quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $16 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.3 percentage points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $273 million. $211 million of that is from business within the United States and $62 million is from operations outside of the United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti revenues were up 14% versus the year-ago period.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the second quarter were up 15% from the prior year. Non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.2 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's take a look at gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.2% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the second quarter 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and lower payroll tax rates, were the largest contributors to the increase.
Permanent placement revenues were 11.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 11.0% during the same period 1 year ago. When combined with the temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 70 basis points compared to the year-ago period to 45.1%.
Protiviti gross margin was $76 million in the second quarter or 27.9% of Protiviti revenues. 1 year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 27.3% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.6% of staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 33.7% in last year's second quarter. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues to this quarter versus 1 year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. SG&A costs for Protiviti in the second quarter were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues versus 19.4% of revenues in the year-ago period.
Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $130 million. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $105 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.5%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $25 million in the second quarter and produced an operating margin of 18.0%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 10.6%.
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $842 million and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.8 days.
Before I move to the third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the second quarter of 2019 and thus far in July, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues up 5.3% versus the prior year compared to a 3.7% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of July were up 4.3% compared to the same period in July 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in June were up 7.6% versus June 1 year ago. This compares to a 6.2% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were down 4.6% compared to the same period last year. We provided this information so that you have insight in some of the trends we saw during the second quarter and into July. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, we caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance: Revenues, $1,525,000,000 to $1,590,000,000; income per share, $0.98 to $1.04.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5% on a same-day as adjusted basis, which includes Protiviti, and EPS growth of 6%. The projected tax rate for the third quarter is 28.5% compared to 24.1% a year ago. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn it over to Max."

We were pleased with our results in the second quarter, both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. The demand for skilled talent is something we don't see diminishing anytime soon. Skill shortages are most pronounced in the professional occupations in which we specialize. Likewise, demand remained strong for the consulting expertise of our Protiviti professionals as they work with companies on risk and compliance, data and analytics, performance improvement and technology-related efforts. Increasingly, Protiviti is collaborating with Robert Half's staffing divisions to work on major client initiatives. Our blended staffing and Protiviti solutions allow us to meet the company's needs at every point in the staffing and consulting continuum. We believe this is a key differentiator for us. Access to talent on a full-time, project and consulting basis is at a premium right now, and with our full spectrum of staffing and Protiviti solutions, we are a reliable resource for this hard-to-find talent and expertise. As we've talked about many times on this call, small and midsized businesses make up the lion's share of our client base, while small business optimism is still at historically high levels, a few of the surveys we follow have reported slightly lower business confidence in recent months. This has had little impact in hiring activity, however. As of June, the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index reported 19 months of consecutive employment growth among small companies. In the June survey, finding qualified workers remain the single most important business problem for these firms.
Looking at the U.S. workforce as a whole, the June employment outlook was positive, with job growth exceeding analysts' estimates. The labor participation rate also rose slightly, which is a positive sign that workers feel confident in their job prospects. For these and other reasons, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in technologies that enable us to deliver a world-class digital experience that complements the personalized service we have perfected over 70 years in the staffing and recruitment industry. 
Earlier this month, we introduced a new mobile app that allows candidates to search for a full-time and temporary jobs, apply instantly and track the status of their applications. The app also recommends on a realtime basis new jobs that match a candidate's preferences.
Now Keith and I would be happy to respond to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

International results were different. We are seeing macros slowing in the Europe and in the U.K., and they offset those trends somewhat. Our guidance assumes that the growth for the quarter will be close to, essentially on a year-over-year basis globally, what it was in Q2, which is some firming in the U.S. according to trends we just talked about, offset by some additional softening in the Europe, U.K. As to the collaboration, it continues to go very well. As we've talked about before, those results get reported in Protiviti, not in staffing. So the staffing trends I just talked about do not consider the additional benefits from what we call a managed business services, managed technology services, which were significant, and we're the fastest growing segment in Protiviti."

Again, our model where we have scalable staff from the staffing side such subject matter expertise for Protiviti continues to go very well. But as I just said, it's in addition to their traditional segments also already doing well. We did see margin expansion on SG&A. You got better leveraging of cost at the gross margin line. They had slightly better pricing, slightly better utilization. We we're very happy the margin, operating margin for the quarter was double-digit. Year-to-date, they're at 9%, which is just below double-digit. Still better than 7.6% a year ago.

Now let's review Robert Half's financial results for the second quarter. Global revenues for the company were $1.516 billion, an increase of 4% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and an increase of 6% on a same-day constant currency basis. Second quarter net income per share was $0.98 versus $0.89 in the same period 1 year ago. This is an increase of 10% year-over-year.
Cash flow from operations was $121 million in the second quarter, and capital expenditures were $16 million. In June, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $60 million. We have 4.9 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid demand for our staffing and Protiviti services during the second quarter. Global talent shortages persist across our professional disciplines, particularly in the United States where unemployment remains near a 50-year low. This enhances the value of our services. During the second quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed discussion."

This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.Accompanying our earni",903,"Thank you, Max. 
As noted, global revenues in the second quarter were $1.516 billion. This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
On an as adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $965 million, up 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $278 million, up 3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
There were 63.4 billing days in the second quarter versus 63.5 in the same quarter 1 year ago. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 63.3 days in the third quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $16 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.3 percentage points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $273 million. $211 million of that is from business within the United States and $62 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti revenues were up 14% versus the year ago period.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the second quarter were up 15% from the prior year. Non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.2 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's take a look at gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.2% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the second quarter 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and lower payroll tax rates were the largest contributors to the increase.
Permanent placement revenues were 11.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 11.0% during the same period 1 year ago. When combined with the temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 70 basis points compared to the year ago period to 45.1%.
Protiviti gross margin was $76 million in the second quarter or 27.9% of Protiviti revenues. 1 year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 27.3% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.6% of staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 33.7% in last year's second quarter. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues to this quarter versus 1 year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. SG&A costs for Protiviti in the second quarter were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues versus 19.4% of revenues in the year ago period.
Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $130 million. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $105 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.5%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $25 million in the second quarter and produced an operating margin of 18.0%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 10.6%.
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $842 million and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.8 days.
Before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the second quarter of 2019 and thus far in July, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues up 5.3% versus the prior year compared to a 3.7% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of July were up 4.3% compared to the same period in July 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in June were up 7.6% versus June 1 year ago. This compares to a 6.2% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were down 4.6% compared to the same period last year. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the second quarter and into July. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, we caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1.525 billion to $1.590 billion; income per share, $0.98 to $1.04.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5% on a same-day as adjusted basis, which includes Protiviti, and EPS growth of 6%. The projected tax rate for the third quarter is 28.5% compared to 24.1% a year ago. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn it over to Max."

We were pleased with our results in the second quarter, both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. The demand for skilled talent is something we don't see diminishing anytime soon. Skill shortages are most pronounced in the professional occupations in which we specialize. Likewise, demand remained strong for the consulting expertise of our Protiviti professionals as they work with companies on risk and compliance, data and analytics, performance improvement and technology-related efforts. Increasingly, Protiviti is collaborating with Robert Half's staffing divisions to work on major client initiatives. Our blended staffing and Protiviti solutions allow us to meet a company's needs at every point in the staffing and consulting continuum. We believe this is a key differentiator for us. 
Access to talent on a full-time project and consulting basis is at a premium right now, and with our full spectrum of staffing and Protiviti solutions, we are a reliable source for this hard-to-find talent and expertise. As we have talked about many times on this call, small and midsized businesses make up the lion's share of our client base. While small business optimism is still at historically high levels, a few of the surveys we follow have reported slightly lower business confidence in recent months. This has had little impact in hiring activity, however. As of June, the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index reported 19 months of consecutive employment growth among small companies. In the June survey, finding qualified workers remain the single most important business problem for these firms.
Looking at the U.S. workforce as a whole, the June employment outlook was positive, with job growth exceeding analysts' estimates. The labor participation rate also rose slightly, which is a positive sign that workers feel confident in their job prospects. For these and other reasons, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in technologies that enable us to deliver a world-class digital experience that complements the personalized service we have perfected over 70 years in the staffing and recruitment industry. 
Earlier this month, we introduced a new mobile app that allows candidates to search for full-time and temporary jobs, apply instantly and track the status of their applications. The app also recommends on a real-time basis new jobs that match a candidate's preferences.
Now Keith and I would be happy to respond to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

International results were different. We are seeing macros slowing in the Europe and in the U.K., and they offset those trends somewhat. Our guidance assumes that the growth for the quarter will be close to, essentially on a year-over-year basis globally, what it was in Q2, which is some firming in the U.S. according to the trends we just talked about, offset by some additional softening in the Europe, U.K. 
As to the collaboration, it continues to go very well. As we've talked about before, those results get reported in Protiviti, not in staffing. So the staffing trends I just talked about do not consider the additional benefits from what we call managed business services, managed technology services, which were significant, and we're the fastest-growing segment in Protiviti."

It's spending we're happy to make. We believe we're already getting payback, particularly in the candidate area.

Examples include remediating material weaknesses, resolving processing backlogs, back-office modernization, standing up shared service centers, user experience, user interface improvements. Again, our model where we have scalable staff from the staffing side, deep subject-matter expertise for Protiviti continues to go very well. But as I just said, it's in addition to their traditional segments also already doing well. 
We did see margin expansion on SG&A. You got better leveraging of cost at the gross margin line. They had slightly better pricing, slightly better utilization. We're very happy their margin, operating margin for the quarter was double digit. Year-to-date, they're at 9%, which is just below double digit. Still better than 7.6% a year ago.

They further get multiple outside offers when it's known that they're looking. So many times we go through an entire process with the candidate. And in the 12th hour, they decide to stay with their existing company or they take another offer and we have to start over, or we have to go to plan B to the extent we've got a plan B in the works.

As to the gross margin expansion, I guess I don't have 5 years of history in front of me. We have to constantly weigh against our spreads versus the market versus our competitors that are largely local and regional. I don't think anybody would dispute that we have industry-leading margins. And we're aware of that, and we -- therefore, we certainly don't want to price ourselves out of the market.

Now let's review Robert Half's financial results for the second quarter. Global revenues for the company were $1.516 billion, an increase of 4% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and an increase of 6% on a same-day constant currency basis. Second quarter net income per share was $0.98 versus $0.89 in the same period 1 year ago. This is an increase of 10% year-over-year.
Cash flow from operations was $121 million in the second quarter, and capital expenditures were $16 million. In June, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $60 million. We have 4.9 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid demand for our staffing and Protiviti services during the second quarter. Global talent shortages persist across our professional disciplines, particularly in the United States where unemployment remains near a 50-year low. This enhances the value of our services. During the second quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed discussion."

This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.Accompanying our earni",903,"Thank you, Max. 
As noted, global revenues in the second quarter were $1.516 billion. This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
On an as adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $965 million, up 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $278 million, up 3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
There were 63.4 billing days in the second quarter versus 63.5 in the same quarter 1 year ago. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 63.3 days in the third quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $16 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.3 percentage points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $273 million. $211 million of that is from business within the United States and $62 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti revenues were up 14% versus the year ago period.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the second quarter were up 15% from the prior year. Non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.2 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's take a look at gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.2% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the second quarter 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and lower payroll tax rates were the largest contributors to the increase.
Permanent placement revenues were 11.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 11.0% during the same period 1 year ago. When combined with the temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 70 basis points compared to the year ago period to 45.1%.
Protiviti gross margin was $76 million in the second quarter or 27.9% of Protiviti revenues. 1 year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 27.3% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.6% of staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 33.7% in last year's second quarter. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues to this quarter versus 1 year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. SG&A costs for Protiviti in the second quarter were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues versus 19.4% of revenues in the year ago period.
Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $130 million. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $105 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.5%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $25 million in the second quarter and produced an operating margin of 18.0%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 10.6%.
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $842 million and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.8 days.
Before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the second quarter of 2019 and thus far in July, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues up 5.3% versus the prior year compared to a 3.7% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of July were up 4.3% compared to the same period in July 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in June were up 7.6% versus June 1 year ago. This compares to a 6.2% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were down 4.6% compared to the same period last year. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the second quarter and into July. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, we caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1.525 billion to $1.590 billion; income per share, $0.98 to $1.04.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5% on a same-day as adjusted basis, which includes Protiviti, and EPS growth of 6%. The projected tax rate for the third quarter is 28.5% compared to 24.1% a year ago. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn it over to Max."

We were pleased with our results in the second quarter, both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. The demand for skilled talent is something we don't see diminishing anytime soon. Skill shortages are most pronounced in the professional occupations in which we specialize. Likewise, demand remained strong for the consulting expertise of our Protiviti professionals as they work with companies on risk and compliance, data and analytics, performance improvement and technology-related efforts. Increasingly, Protiviti is collaborating with Robert Half's staffing divisions to work on major client initiatives. Our blended staffing and Protiviti solutions allow us to meet a company's needs at every point in the staffing and consulting continuum. We believe this is a key differentiator for us. 
Access to talent on a full-time project and consulting basis is at a premium right now, and with our full spectrum of staffing and Protiviti solutions, we are a reliable source for this hard-to-find talent and expertise. As we have talked about many times on this call, small and midsized businesses make up the lion's share of our client base. While small business optimism is still at historically high levels, a few of the surveys we follow have reported slightly lower business confidence in recent months. This has had little impact in hiring activity, however. As of June, the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index reported 19 months of consecutive employment growth among small companies. In the June survey, finding qualified workers remain the single most important business problem for these firms.
Looking at the U.S. workforce as a whole, the June employment outlook was positive, with job growth exceeding analysts' estimates. The labor participation rate also rose slightly, which is a positive sign that workers feel confident in their job prospects. For these and other reasons, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in technologies that enable us to deliver a world-class digital experience that complements the personalized service we have perfected over 70 years in the staffing and recruitment industry. 
Earlier this month, we introduced a new mobile app that allows candidates to search for full-time and temporary jobs, apply instantly and track the status of their applications. The app also recommends on a real-time basis new jobs that match a candidate's preferences.
Now Keith and I would be happy to respond to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

International results were different. We are seeing macros slowing in the Europe and in the U.K., and they offset those trends somewhat. Our guidance assumes that the growth for the quarter will be close to, essentially on a year-over-year basis globally, what it was in Q2, which is some firming in the U.S. according to the trends we just talked about, offset by some additional softening in the Europe, U.K. 
As to the collaboration, it continues to go very well. As we've talked about before, those results get reported in Protiviti, not in staffing. So the staffing trends I just talked about do not consider the additional benefits from what we call managed business services, managed technology services, which were significant, and we're the fastest-growing segment in Protiviti."

It's spending we're happy to make. We believe we're already getting payback, particularly in the candidate area.

Examples include remediating material weaknesses, resolving processing backlogs, back-office modernization, standing up shared service centers, user experience, user interface improvements. Again, our model where we have scalable staff from the staffing side, deep subject-matter expertise for Protiviti continues to go very well. But as I just said, it's in addition to their traditional segments also already doing well. 
We did see margin expansion on SG&A. You got better leveraging of cost at the gross margin line. They had slightly better pricing, slightly better utilization. We're very happy their margin, operating margin for the quarter was double digit. Year-to-date, they're at 9%, which is just below double digit. Still better than 7.6% a year ago.

As to the tone of business in perm, particularly from a client point of view, clients are just as picky as they were, which slows us down. We're further slowed down by candidates who are getting counteroffers from their existing employers when they go tell them they're going to leave. They further get multiple outside offers when it's known that they're looking. So many times we go through an entire process with the candidate. And in the 12th hour, they decide to stay with their existing company or they take another offer and we have to start over, or we have to go to plan B to the extent we've got a plan B in the works.

And as unemployment rates continue to come down, our expectation would be we'll continue to see benefits from that. 
As to the gross margin expansion, I guess I don't have 5 years of history in front of me. We have to constantly weigh against our spreads versus the market versus our competitors that are largely local and regional. I don't think anybody would dispute that we have industry-leading margins. And we're aware of that, and we -- therefore, we certainly don't want to price ourselves out of the market.

Now let's review Robert Half's financial results for the second quarter. Global revenues for the company were $1.516 billion, an increase of 4% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and an increase of 6% on a same-day constant currency basis. Second quarter net income per share was $0.98 versus $0.89 in the same period 1 year ago. This is an increase of 10% year-over-year.
Cash flow from operations was $121 million in the second quarter, and capital expenditures were $16 million. In June, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $60 million. We have 4.9 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid demand for our staffing and Protiviti services during the second quarter. Global talent shortages persist across our professional disciplines, particularly in the United States where unemployment remains near a 50-year low. This enhances the value of our services. During the second quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith for a more detailed discussion."

This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.Accompanying our earni",903,"Thank you, Max. 
As noted, global revenues in the second quarter were $1.516 billion. This is up 4% from the prior year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 6% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
On an as adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $965 million, up 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $278 million, up 3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
There were 63.4 billing days in the second quarter versus 63.5 in the same quarter 1 year ago. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 63.3 days in the third quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $16 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.3 percentage points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $273 million. $211 million of that is from business within the United States and $62 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti revenues were up 14% versus the year ago period.
On a same-day basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the second quarter were up 15% from the prior year. Non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 1.2 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's take a look at gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, gross margin was 38.2% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the second quarter 1 year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and lower payroll tax rates were the largest contributors to the increase.
Permanent placement revenues were 11.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 11.0% during the same period 1 year ago. When combined with the temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 70 basis points compared to the year ago period to 45.1%.
Protiviti gross margin was $76 million in the second quarter or 27.9% of Protiviti revenues. 1 year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 27.3% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.6% of staffing revenues in the second quarter compared to 33.7% in last year's second quarter. The higher mix of permanent placement revenues to this quarter versus 1 year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's SG&A ratio. SG&A costs for Protiviti in the second quarter were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues versus 19.4% of revenues in the year ago period.
Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $130 million. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $105 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.5%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $25 million in the second quarter and produced an operating margin of 18.0%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 10.6%.
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $842 million and implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.8 days.
Before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the second quarter of 2019 and thus far in July, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues up 5.3% versus the prior year compared to a 3.7% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of July were up 4.3% compared to the same period in July 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in June were up 7.6% versus June 1 year ago. This compares to a 6.2% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were down 4.6% compared to the same period last year. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the second quarter and into July. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, we caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1.525 billion to $1.590 billion; income per share, $0.98 to $1.04.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 5% on a same-day as adjusted basis, which includes Protiviti, and EPS growth of 6%. The projected tax rate for the third quarter is 28.5% compared to 24.1% a year ago. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn it over to Max."

We were pleased with our results in the second quarter, both in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. The demand for skilled talent is something we don't see diminishing anytime soon. Skill shortages are most pronounced in the professional occupations in which we specialize. Likewise, demand remained strong for the consulting expertise of our Protiviti professionals as they work with companies on risk and compliance, data and analytics, performance improvement and technology-related efforts. Increasingly, Protiviti is collaborating with Robert Half's staffing divisions to work on major client initiatives. Our blended staffing and Protiviti solutions allow us to meet a company's needs at every point in the staffing and consulting continuum. We believe this is a key differentiator for us. 
Access to talent on a full-time project and consulting basis is at a premium right now, and with our full spectrum of staffing and Protiviti solutions, we are a reliable source for this hard-to-find talent and expertise. As we have talked about many times on this call, small and midsized businesses make up the lion's share of our client base. While small business optimism is still at historically high levels, a few of the surveys we follow have reported slightly lower business confidence in recent months. This has had little impact in hiring activity, however. As of June, the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index reported 19 months of consecutive employment growth among small companies. In the June survey, finding qualified workers remain the single most important business problem for these firms.
Looking at the U.S. workforce as a whole, the June employment outlook was positive, with job growth exceeding analysts' estimates. The labor participation rate also rose slightly, which is a positive sign that workers feel confident in their job prospects. For these and other reasons, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in technologies that enable us to deliver a world-class digital experience that complements the personalized service we have perfected over 70 years in the staffing and recruitment industry. 
Earlier this month, we introduced a new mobile app that allows candidates to search for full-time and temporary jobs, apply instantly and track the status of their applications. The app also recommends on a real-time basis new jobs that match a candidate's preferences.
Now Keith and I would be happy to respond to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

International results were different. We are seeing macros slowing in the Europe and in the U.K., and they offset those trends somewhat. Our guidance assumes that the growth for the quarter will be close to, essentially on a year-over-year basis globally, what it was in Q2, which is some firming in the U.S. according to the trends we just talked about, offset by some additional softening in the Europe, U.K. 
As to the collaboration, it continues to go very well. As we've talked about before, those results get reported in Protiviti, not in staffing. So the staffing trends I just talked about do not consider the additional benefits from what we call managed business services, managed technology services, which were significant, and we're the fastest-growing segment in Protiviti."

We talked earlier on the call about we released a new mobile app a couple of weeks ago that's principally candidate-focused. So the tech spending continues kind of irrespective of revenues. It's spending we're happy to make. We believe we're already getting payback, particularly in the candidate area.

Examples include remediating material weaknesses, resolving processing backlogs, back-office modernization, standing up shared service centers, user experience, user interface improvements. Again, our model where we have scalable staff from the staffing side, deep subject-matter expertise for Protiviti continues to go very well. But as I just said, it's in addition to their traditional segments also already doing well. 
We did see margin expansion on SG&A. You got better leveraging of cost at the gross margin line. They had slightly better pricing, slightly better utilization. We're very happy their margin, operating margin for the quarter was double digit. Year-to-date, they're at 9%, which is just below double digit. Still better than 7.6% a year ago. Our expectation is that they'll have double-digit margins the last 2 quarters of the year and will end the year with double-digit margins, which we talked about being our goal for some time. So very strong revenue performance. U.S. and non-U.S. Although non-U.S. had very high comps from a year ago, they also saw some slowing in Europe, U.K. But still all things considered, Protiviti non-U.S. wasn't bad; Protiviti U.S. was outstanding."

As to the tone of business in perm, particularly from a client point of view, clients are just as picky as they were, which slows us down. We're further slowed down by candidates who are getting counteroffers from their existing employers when they go tell them they're going to leave. They further get multiple outside offers when it's known that they're looking. So many times we go through an entire process with the candidate. And in the 12th hour, they decide to stay with their existing company or they take another offer and we have to start over, or we have to go to plan B to the extent we've got a plan B in the works. 
But the point is clients are still demanding. They're still picky. They're still selective. Candidates are still tight. They're in demand. They have many opportunities, which makes them more selective and more picky, so you got both sides counterintuitively being more selective."

And as unemployment rates continue to come down, our expectation would be we'll continue to see benefits from that. 
As to the gross margin expansion, I guess I don't have 5 years of history in front of me. We have to constantly weigh against our spreads versus the market versus our competitors that are largely local and regional. I don't think anybody would dispute that we have industry-leading margins. And we're aware of that, and we -- therefore, we certainly don't want to price ourselves out of the market.

Now let's review Robert Half's third quarter financial results. Revenues for the company were $1,552,000,000, up 6% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter net income per share was $1.01 versus $0.95 in the same period one year ago, this is a 7% increase year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the third quarter and capital expenditures were $17 million. 
In September, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately $1.5 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $80 million. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchases under our Board approved stock repurchase plan. 
Persistent talent shortages resulted in continued strong demand for our staffing services in the third quarter, particularly in The United States, Robert Half management resources was the standout among our staffing lines of business, and our productivity subsidiary also had a very strong quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in the U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations. Return on invested capital for the company was 42% in the third quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed look at our third quarter results."
276703,640754869,1837418,"Robert Half International Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Robert Half Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Max.

As just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.552 billion. This is up 6% from the prior year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
On an as adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 3% year-over-year, U.S. staffing revenues were $973 million, up 5% on an as adjusted basis, non-U.S. GAAP being revenues were $280 million, down 0.3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
There were 64.1 billing days in the third quarter versus 63.3 days in the same quarter one year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter one year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million, this reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.9 percentage points.
Now let's take a look at the results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $299 million, $235 million of that is from The United States and $64 million is from operations outside The United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti global revenues were up 15% versus the year ago period.
On an as adjusted basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were up 16% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates have the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently-owned Member Firms served clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.9% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago.
In our permanent placement business, revenues were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter of 2019, which is flat compared to the last year's third quarter. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 10 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter of 44.6%.
Protiviti gross margin was $88 million in the third quarter or 29.5% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 34.1% in last year's third quarter.
SG&A cost for Protiviti in the third quarter were 16.2% of Protiviti revenues versus 18.0% of revenues in the year ago period.
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $123 million, operating margin was 9.8%. Of this amount, our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $101 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.1%, while our permanent placement division reported operating income of $22 million and produced an operating margin of 16.2%.
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $40 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%.
Accounts receivable were $853 million at the end of the third quarter and implied days sales outstanding were 49.3 days.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenue up 2.8% versus the prior year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 4% compared to the same period in October one year ago when revenues were up 9%.
Permanent placement revenues in September were up 0.5% compared to September of 2018, this compares to 3.4% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were essentially flat compared to the same period last year when revenues were up 20%. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, we caution against reading too much into them. With that mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance. $1,500,000,000 to $1,565,000,000, income per share $0.94 to $1. 
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a same-day as adjusted basis, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 2%. The projected tax rate is 28% compared to 27% a year ago. Compared sequentially to the third quarter just ended, the midpoint of our guidance implies negative revenue and EPS growth of 1% and 4%, respectively. This differs from typical seasonal trends due to the loss of an extra billing day between the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. 
In 2019, we lose 2.4 days sequentially, whereas, in 2018, we lost only 1.6 days between quarters.
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's third quarter results and encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and consulting operation. As we noted earlier, Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. Demand for Protiviti's services was broad-based across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions, including its managed solutions offering provided jointly with our staffing operations. 
Our staffing operations are benefiting from the strong labor market, particularly in The United States. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. The last time the rate was as slow was in December 1969. Staffing challenges are particularly acute for companies that are making technology investments. The skills required for digital transformation projects are in short supply, which is fueling higher demand for specialized staffing services like ours. 
We believe global labor shortages are going to have a durable impact on hiring demand. CEO conference index showed a decline in overall confidence among CEOs of small and midsized businesses in September, yet nearly 60% of these CEOs plan to hire in the year ahead, a 4-point increase from the prior month. While many of the various business confidence indices are of their historic highs, they remained at strong absolute levels.
We're focused on technology investments within Robert Half, as we talked about on this call in the past whether customers engage with us online or in person, we can provide a seamless experience supported by technology and the expertise of our local staffing experts. That's a unique combination, which we believe is a key differentiator for Robert Half. 
We also see the blended solutions offered by our staffing and Protiviti operations as an important differentiator. Protiviti's 2019 global finance trends survey found that managed solutions models where major projects are handled by a blend of full-time staff, contract professionals and third-party experts are gaining in popularity as an alternative to traditional outsourcing arrangements. We believe we are uniquely qualified to provide these diverse staffing and consulting solutions all under one roof. 
Now, Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

For revenues and staffing, we're basically seeing year-over-year growth rate staying essentially flat with the third quarter. The U.S. stay strong, Europe continues to slow, but the comps do get 4 points easier or particularly pleased with how we're doing in the U.S. The macro and trade policy uncertainty that's in the news every day seems mostly limited to manufacturing and its supply chain, and we don't have a lot of exposure to that. So we're holding up very well in our judgment in the U.S. Because it's the fourth quarter, there is always calendar anxiety, this year maybe more so because the holidays fall on Wednesday. The concern is that more people decide to take the full week of both Canada's and clients, which could have more impact than it typically does. But again, revenue, staffing, year-over-year growth rates essentially flat with Q3. Revenues Protiviti, they will slow modestly in part because the comps are the toughest yet, they were up 19% a year ago. In the international zone, they have a couple of large projects that ended, that will take them a little time to replace further with Protiviti because they have been so busy this year, their staff have differed a lot of that time off. That time off is scheduled heavier in December than is typically the case partly because of the date that I talked about and partly because they just have more deferred time off, that effectively shortens the quarter even more for Protiviti. So some modest slowing in the year-over-year growth rates for Protiviti. Gross margin flat to up 20 basis points, Protiviti gross margin down 30 to 50 basis points because of the time off and holiday impact that I just talked about, effectively they utilized their staff less because of that downtime. SG&A staffing up 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to negative leverage from the international zone. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, operating leverage due to higher revenues, that means operating income for staffing down 40 to 60 basis points year-on-year. Protiviti up 10 to 30 basis points year-on-year. Tax rate 27.5% to 28%, more nondeductible cost pursuant to the last tax law change shares about $115 million."

Now let's review Robert Half's third quarter financial results. Revenues for the company were $1.552 billion, up 6% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter net income per share was $1.01 versus $0.95 in the same period one year ago. This is a 7% increase year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the third quarter, and capital expenditures were $17 million. 
In September, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $80 million. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchases under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
Persistent talent shortages resulted in continued strong demand for our staffing services in the third quarter, particularly in the United States. Robert Half Management Resources was the standout among our staffing lines of business, and our Protiviti subsidiary also had a very strong quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations. Return on invested capital for the company was 42% in the third quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed look at our third quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.552 billion. This is up 6% from the prior year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
On an as adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 3% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $973 million, up 5% on an as adjusted basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $280 million, down 0.3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
There were 64.1 billing days in the third quarter versus 63.3 days in the same quarter one year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter one year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.9 percentage points.
Now let's take a look at the results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $299 million, $235 million of that is from the United States and $64 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti global revenues were up 15% versus the year ago period.
On an as adjusted basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were up 16% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently-owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.9% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago.
In our permanent placement business, revenues were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter of 2019, which is flat compared to the last year's third quarter. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 10 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter of 44.6%.
Protiviti gross margin was $88 million in the third quarter or 29.5% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 34.1% in last year's third quarter.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 16.2% of Protiviti revenues versus 18.0% of revenues in the year ago period.
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $123 million, operating margin was 9.8%. Of this amount, our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $101 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.1%, while our permanent placement division reported operating income of $22 million and produced an operating margin of 16.2%.
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $40 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%.
Accounts receivable were $853 million at the end of the third quarter and implied days sales outstanding were 49.3 days.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.8% versus the prior year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 4% compared to the same period in October one year ago when revenues were up 9%.
Permanent placement revenues in September were up 0.5% compared to September of 2018. This compares to 3.4% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were essentially flat compared to the same period last year when revenues were up 20%. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: $1.500 billion to $1.565 billion; income per share $0.94 to $1. 
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a same-day as adjusted basis, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 2%. The projected tax rate is 28% compared to 27% a year ago. Compared sequentially to the third quarter just ended, the midpoint of our guidance implies negative revenue and EPS growth of 1% and 4%, respectively. This differs from typical seasonal trends due to the loss of an extra billing day between the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. 
In 2019, we lose 2.4 days sequentially, whereas, in 2018, we lost only 1.6 days between quarters.
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's third quarter results and encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and consulting operations. As we noted earlier, Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. Demand for Protiviti's services was broad-based across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions, including its managed solutions offerings provided jointly with our staffing operations. 
Our staffing operations are benefiting from the strong labor market, particularly in the United States. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. The last time the rate was this low was in December 1969. Staffing challenges are particularly acute for companies that are making technology investments. The skills required for digital transformation projects are in short supply, which is fueling higher demand for specialized staffing services like ours. 
We believe global labor shortages are going to have a durable impact on hiring demand. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index showed a decline in overall confidence among CEOs of small and midsized businesses in September, yet nearly 60% of these CEOs plan to hire in the year ahead, a 4 point increase from the prior month. While many of the various business confidence indices are off their historic highs, they remain at strong absolute levels.
We're focused on technology investments within Robert Half, as we have talked about on this call in the past. Whether customers engage with us online or in person, we can provide a seamless experience supported by technology and the expertise of our local staffing experts. That's a unique combination, which we believe is a key differentiator for Robert Half. 
We also see the blended solutions offered by our staffing and Protiviti operations as an important differentiator. Protiviti's 2019 Global Finance Trends Survey found that managed solutions models, where major projects are handled by a blend of full-time staff, contract professionals and third-party experts, are gaining in popularity as an alternative to traditional outsourcing arrangements. We believe we are uniquely qualified to provide these diverse staffing and consulting solutions all under one roof. 
Now, Keith and I would be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

Blended solutions, we call managed business solutions, managed technology solutions did particularly well. Clients certainly appreciate the deep subject matter expertise they get from Protiviti and the scalable variable resources they get from staffing, they get that all under one roof. Whether they're building something new, whether they're fixing a problem, whether they're cleaning up a backlog, all 3 are perfect use cases for that blended solution. As far as the development, we think it's early days. Potential, we think, is tremendous. It's clearly for 3 or 4 quarters in a row been one of our fastest-growing operations, and we believe there is a lot of upside from where we are. 
On guidance, maybe we'll just go down the P&L a bit. For revenues with staffing, we're basically seeing year-over-year growth rate staying essentially flat with the third quarter. The U.S. stayed strong. Europe continues to slow, but the comps do get 4 points easier. We're particularly pleased with how we're doing in the U.S. The macro and trade policy uncertainty that's in the news every day seems mostly limited to manufacturing and its supply chain, and we don't have a lot of exposure to that. So we're holding up very well in our judgment in the U.S. Because it's the fourth quarter, there is always calendar anxiety, this year maybe more so than most because the holidays fall on Wednesday. The concern is that more people decide to take the full week off, both candidates and clients, which could have more impact than it typically does. But again, revenue, staffing, year-over-year growth rates essentially flat with Q3.
Revenues Protiviti, they will slow modestly, in part because the comps are the toughest yet, they were up 19% a year ago. In the international zone, they have a couple of large projects that ended. That will take them a little time to replace. Further with Protiviti, because they have been so busy this year, their staff have deferred a lot of their time off. That time off is scheduled heavier in December than is typically the case, partly because of the Wednesday date that I talked about and partly because they just have more deferred time off. That effectively shortens the quarter even more for Protiviti. So some modest slowing in the year-over-year growth rates for Protiviti. Gross margin flat to up 20 basis points, Protiviti gross margin down 30 to 50 basis points because of the time off and holiday impact that I just talked about. Effectively they utilize their staff less because of that downtime. 
SG&A, staffing up 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to negative leverage from the international zone. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating leverage due to higher revenues, that means operating income for staffing down 40 to 60 basis points year-on-year. Protiviti up 10 to 30 basis points year-on-year. Tax rate 27.5% to 28%. More nondeductible cost pursuant to the last tax law change. Shares about 115 million."

This is the work other than that. I would say a few observations. One, their clients have leaner middle management, which means any time they have a project or anything out of the ordinary, they are more in need for specialized skills, particularly higher level, which is where Management Resources focuses. Further, the candidate supply for Robert Half Management Resources is very different than for Accountemps, as an example. Management Resources have access to a lot of people that have chosen to be contractors or consultants as a career. And that essentially is not the case at all with Accountemps. Further, the Management Resources candidates will travel and clients will pay for that travel, which further helps from a supply point of view. So a very different candidate supply story for Management Resources than is the case for Accountemps."

Now let's review Robert Half's third quarter financial results. Revenues for the company were $1.552 billion, up 6% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter net income per share was $1.01 versus $0.95 in the same period one year ago. This is a 7% increase year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the third quarter, and capital expenditures were $17 million. 
In September, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $80 million. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchases under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
Persistent talent shortages resulted in continued strong demand for our staffing services in the third quarter, particularly in the United States. Robert Half Management Resources was the standout among our staffing lines of business, and our Protiviti subsidiary also had a very strong quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations. Return on invested capital for the company was 42% in the third quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed look at our third quarter results."

The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
On an as adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 3% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $973 million, up 5% on an as adjusted basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $280 million, down 0.3% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
There were 64.1 billing days in the third quarter versus 63.3 days in the same quarter one year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter one year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.9 percentage points.
Now let's take a look at the results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $299 million, $235 million of that is from the United States and $64 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as adjusted basis, Protiviti global revenues were up 15% versus the year ago period.
On an as adjusted basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were up 16% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently-owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.9% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago.
In our permanent placement business, revenues were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter of 2019, which is flat compared to the last year's third quarter. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 10 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter of 44.6%.
Protiviti gross margin was $88 million in the third quarter or 29.5% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 34.1% in last year's third quarter.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 16.2% of Protiviti revenues versus 18.0% of revenues in the year ago period.
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $123 million, operating margin was 9.8%. Of this amount, our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $101 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.1%, while our permanent placement division reported operating income of $22 million and produced an operating margin of 16.2%.
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $40 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%.
Accounts receivable were $853 million at the end of the third quarter and implied days sales outstanding were 49.3 days.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.8% versus the prior year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 4% compared to the same period in October one year ago when revenues were up 9%.
Permanent placement revenues in September were up 0.5% compared to September of 2018. This compares to 3.4% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were essentially flat compared to the same period last year when revenues were up 20%. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: $1.500 billion to $1.565 billion; income per share $0.94 to $1. 
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a same-day as adjusted basis, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 2%. The projected tax rate is 28% compared to 27% a year ago. Compared sequentially to the third quarter just ended, the midpoint of our guidance implies negative revenue and EPS growth of 1% and 4%, respectively. This differs from typical seasonal trends due to the loss of an extra billing day between the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. 
In 2019, we lose 2.4 days sequentially, whereas, in 2018, we lost only 1.6 days between quarters.
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's third quarter results and encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and consulting operations. As we noted earlier, Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. Demand for Protiviti's services was broad-based across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions, including its managed solutions offerings provided jointly with our staffing operations. 
Our staffing operations are benefiting from the strong labor market, particularly in the United States. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. The last time the rate was this low was in December 1969. Staffing challenges are particularly acute for companies that are making technology investments. The skills required for digital transformation projects are in short supply, which is fueling higher demand for specialized staffing services like ours. 
We believe global labor shortages are going to have a durable impact on hiring demand. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index showed a decline in overall confidence among CEOs of small and midsized businesses in September, yet nearly 60% of these CEOs plan to hire in the year ahead, a 4 point increase from the prior month. While many of the various business confidence indices are off their historic highs, they remain at strong absolute levels.
We're focused on technology investments within Robert Half, as we have talked about on this call in the past. Whether customers engage with us online or in person, we can provide a seamless experience supported by technology and the expertise of our local staffing experts. That's a unique combination, which we believe is a key differentiator for Robert Half. 
We also see the blended solutions offered by our staffing and Protiviti operations as an important differentiator. Protiviti's 2019 Global Finance Trends Survey found that managed solutions models, where major projects are handled by a blend of full-time staff, contract professionals and third-party experts, are gaining in popularity as an alternative to traditional outsourcing arrangements. We believe we are uniquely qualified to provide these diverse staffing and consulting solutions all under one roof. 
Now, Keith and I would be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the growth that you're seeing in your blended solutions, your managed solutions combination? And where is that in terms of its development? What sort of potential do you see out of that? That's one question. And then the follow-up has to do with the guidance. I'm just wondering, Keith, sometimes you provide some detail with regards to what you are explicitly expecting by segment, both in terms of trends as well as from a margin perspective?"

Client",522,"So our blended solutions did quite well yet again. As Max said earlier, Protiviti's growth was broad-based across all of its solutions areas. Blended solutions, we call managed business solutions, managed technology solutions did particularly well. Clients certainly appreciate the deep subject matter expertise they get from Protiviti and the scalable variable resources they get from staffing, they get that all under one roof. Whether they're building something new, whether they're fixing a problem, whether they're cleaning up a backlog, all 3 are perfect use cases for that blended solution. As far as the development, we think it's early days. Potential, we think, is tremendous. It's clearly for 3 or 4 quarters in a row been one of our fastest-growing operations, and we believe there is a lot of upside from where we are. 
On guidance, maybe we'll just go down the P&L a bit. For revenues with staffing, we're basically seeing year-over-year growth rate staying essentially flat with the third quarter. The U.S. stayed strong. Europe continues to slow, but the comps do get 4 points easier. We're particularly pleased with how we're doing in the U.S. The macro and trade policy uncertainty that's in the news every day seems mostly limited to manufacturing and its supply chain, and we don't have a lot of exposure to that. So we're holding up very well in our judgment in the U.S. Because it's the fourth quarter, there is always calendar anxiety, this year maybe more so than most because the holidays fall on Wednesday. The concern is that more people decide to take the full week off, both candidates and clients, which could have more impact than it typically does. But again, revenue, staffing, year-over-year growth rates essentially flat with Q3.
Revenues Protiviti, they will slow modestly, in part because the comps are the toughest yet, they were up 19% a year ago. In the international zone, they have a couple of large projects that ended. That will take them a little time to replace. Further with Protiviti, because they have been so busy this year, their staff have deferred a lot of their time off. That time off is scheduled heavier in December than is typically the case, partly because of the Wednesday date that I talked about and partly because they just have more deferred time off. That effectively shortens the quarter even more for Protiviti. So some modest slowing in the year-over-year growth rates for Protiviti. Gross margin flat to up 20 basis points, Protiviti gross margin down 30 to 50 basis points because of the time off and holiday impact that I just talked about. Effectively they utilize their staff less because of that downtime. 
SG&A, staffing up 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to negative leverage from the international zone. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating leverage due to higher revenues, that means operating income for staffing down 40 to 60 basis points year-on-year. Protiviti up 10 to 30 basis points year-on-year. Tax rate 27.5% to 28%. More nondeductible cost pursuant to the last tax law change. Shares about 115 million."

One, their clients have leaner middle management, which means any time they have a project or anything out of the ordinary, they are more in need for specialized skills, particularly higher level, which is where Management Resources focuses. Further, the candidate supply for Robert Half Management Resources is very different than for Accountemps, as an example. Management Resources have access to a lot of people that have chosen to be contractors or consultants as a career. And that essentially is not the case at all with Accountemps. Further, the Management Resources candidates will travel and clients will pay for that travel, which further helps from a supply point of view.

Now let's review Robert Half's third quarter financial results. Revenues for the company were $1.552 billion, up 6% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter net income per share was $1.01 versus $0.95 in the same period one year ago. This is a 7% increase year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the third quarter, and capital expenditures were $17 million. 
In September, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $80 million. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchases under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
Persistent talent shortages resulted in continued strong demand for our staffing services in the third quarter, particularly in the United States. Robert Half Management Resources was the standout among our staffing lines of business, and our Protiviti subsidiary also had a very strong quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations. Return on invested capital for the company was 42% in the third quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed look at our third quarter results."

This is up 6% from the prior year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.Accompanying our earn",942,"Thank you, Max. As just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.552 billion. This is up 6% from the prior year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
On an as adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 3% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $973 million, up 5% on an as-adjusted basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $280 million, down 0.3% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
There were 64.1 billing days in the third quarter versus 63.3 days in the same quarter one year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter one year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.9 percentage points.
Now let's take a look at the results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $299 million, $235 million of that is from the United States and $64 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, Protiviti global revenues were up 15% versus the year ago period.
On an as-adjusted basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were up 16% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.9% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago.
In our permanent placement business, revenues were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter of 2019, which is flat compared to the last year's third quarter. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 10 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter of 44.6%.
Protiviti gross margin was $88 million in the third quarter or 29.5% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 34.1% in last year's third quarter.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 16.2% of Protiviti revenues versus 18.0% of revenues in the year ago period.
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $123 million, operating margin was 9.8%. Of this amount, our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $101 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.1%, while our permanent placement division reported operating income of $22 million and produced an operating margin of 16.2%.
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $40 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%.
Accounts receivable were $853 million at the end of the third quarter and implied days sales outstanding were 49.3 days.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.8% versus the prior year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 4% compared to the same period in October one year ago when revenues were up 9%.
Permanent placement revenues in September were up 0.5% compared to September of 2018. This compares to 3.4% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were essentially flat compared to the same period last year when revenues were up 20%. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: $1.500 billion to $1.565 billion; income per share $0.94 to $1. 
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti, and EPS growth of 2%. The projected tax rate is 28% compared to 27% a year ago. Compared sequentially to the third quarter just ended, the midpoint of our guidance implies negative revenue and EPS growth of 1% and 4%, respectively. This differs from typical seasonal trends due to the loss of an extra billing day between the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. 
In 2019, we lose 2.4 days sequentially, whereas in 2018, we lost only 1.6 days between quarters.
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's third quarter results and encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and consulting operations. As we noted earlier, Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. Demand for Protiviti's services was broad-based across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions, including its managed solutions offerings provided jointly with our staffing operations. 
Our staffing operations are benefiting from the strong labor market, particularly in the United States. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. The last time the rate was this low was in December 1969.
Staffing challenges are particularly acute for companies that are making technology investments. The skills required for digital transformation projects are in short supply, which is fueling higher demand for specialized staffing services like ours. 
We believe global labor shortages are going to have a durable impact on hiring demand. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index showed a decline in overall confidence among CEOs of small and midsized businesses in September, yet nearly 60% of these CEOs plan to hire in the year ahead, a 4 point increase from the prior month. While many of the various business confidence indices are off their historic highs, they remain at strong absolute levels.
We're focused on technology investments within Robert Half, as we have talked about on this call in the past. Whether customers engage with us online or in person, we can provide a seamless experience supported by technology and the expertise of our local staffing experts. That's a unique combination, which we believe is a key differentiator for Robert Half. 
We also see the blended solutions offered by our staffing and Protiviti operations as an important differentiator. Protiviti's 2019 Global Finance Trends Survey found that managed solutions models, where major projects are handled by a blend of full-time staff, contract professionals and third-party experts, are gaining in popularity as an alternative to traditional outsourcing arrangements. We believe we are uniquely qualified to provide these diverse staffing and consulting solutions all under one roof. 
Now, Keith and I would be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

Client",523,"So our blended solutions did quite well yet again. As Max said earlier, Protiviti's growth was broad-based across all of its solutions areas. Blended solutions, we call managed business solutions, managed technology solutions did particularly well. Clients certainly appreciate the deep subject matter expertise they get from Protiviti and the scalable variable resources they get from staffing, they get that all under one roof. Whether they're building something new, whether they're fixing a problem, whether they're cleaning up a backlog, all 3 are perfect use cases for that blended solution. As far as the development, we think it's early days. Potential, we think, is tremendous. It's clearly for 3 or 4 quarters in a row been one of our fastest-growing operations, and we believe there is a lot of upside from where we are. 
On guidance, maybe we'll just go down the P&L a bit. For revenues with staffing, we're basically seeing year-over-year growth rate staying essentially flat with the third quarter. The U.S. stayed strong. Europe continues to slow, but the comps do get 4 points easier. We're particularly pleased with how we're doing in the U.S. The macro and trade policy uncertainty that's in the news every day seems mostly limited to manufacturing and its supply chain, and we don't have a lot of exposure to that. So we're holding up very well in our judgment in the U.S. Because it's the fourth quarter, there is always calendar anxiety, this year maybe more so than most because the holidays fall on Wednesday. The concern is that more people decide to take the full week off, both candidates and clients, which could have more impact than it typically does. But again, revenue, staffing, year-over-year growth rates essentially flat with Q3.
Revenues Protiviti, they will slow modestly, in part because the comps are the toughest yet, they were up 19% a year ago. In the international zone, they have a couple of large projects that ended. That will take them a little time to replace. Further with Protiviti, because they have been so busy this year, their staff have deferred a lot of their time off. That time off is scheduled heavier in December than is typically the case, partly because of the Wednesday date that I talked about and partly because they just have more deferred time off. That effectively shortens the quarter even more for Protiviti. So some modest slowing in the year-over-year growth rates for Protiviti. Temp gross margin flat to up 20 basis points, Protiviti gross margin down 30 to 50 basis points because of the time off and holiday impact that I just talked about. Effectively they utilize their staff less because of that downtime. 
SG&A, staffing up 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to negative leverage from the international zone. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating leverage due to higher revenues, that means operating income for staffing down 40 to 60 basis points year-on-year. Protiviti up 10 to 30 basis points year-on-year. Tax rate 27.5% to 28%. More nondeductible cost pursuant to the last tax law change. Shares about 115 million."

This is the work other than that. I would say a few observations. One, their clients have leaner middle management, which means any time they have a project or anything out of the ordinary, they are more in need for specialized skills, particularly higher level, which is where Management Resources focuses. Further, the candidate supply for Robert Half Management Resources is very different than for Accountemps, as an example. Management Resources have access to a lot of people that have chosen to be contractors or consultants as a career. And that essentially is not the case at all with Accountemps. Further, the Management Resources candidates will travel and clients will pay for that travel, which further helps from a supply point of view. So a very different candidate supply story for Management Resources than is the case for Accountemps."

Now let's review Robert Half's third quarter financial results. Revenues for the company were $1.552 billion, up 6% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter net income per share was $1.01 versus $0.95 in the same period one year ago. This is a 7% increase year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the third quarter, and capital expenditures were $17 million. 
In September, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $80 million. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchases under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
Persistent talent shortages resulted in continued strong demand for our staffing services in the third quarter, particularly in the United States. Robert Half Management Resources was the standout among our staffing lines of business, and our Protiviti subsidiary also had a very strong quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations. Return on invested capital for the company was 42% in the third quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed look at our third quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.552 billion. This is up 6% from the prior year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
On an as adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 3% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $973 million, up 5% on an as-adjusted basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $280 million, down 0.3% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
There were 64.1 billing days in the third quarter versus 63.3 days in the same quarter one year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter one year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.9 percentage points.
Now let's take a look at the results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $299 million, $235 million of that is from the United States and $64 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, Protiviti global revenues were up 15% versus the year ago period.
On an as-adjusted basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were up 16% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.9% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago.
In our permanent placement business, revenues were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter of 2019, which is flat compared to the last year's third quarter. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 10 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter of 44.6%.
Protiviti gross margin was $88 million in the third quarter or 29.5% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 34.1% in last year's third quarter.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 16.2% of Protiviti revenues versus 18.0% of revenues in the year ago period.
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $123 million, operating margin was 9.8%. Of this amount, our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $101 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.1%, while our permanent placement division reported operating income of $22 million and produced an operating margin of 16.2%.
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $40 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%.
Accounts receivable were $853 million at the end of the third quarter and implied days sales outstanding were 49.3 days.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.8% versus the prior year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 4% compared to the same period in October one year ago when revenues were up 9%.
Permanent placement revenues in September were up 0.5% compared to September of 2018. This compares to 3.4% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were essentially flat compared to the same period last year when revenues were up 20%. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: $1.500 billion to $1.565 billion; income per share $0.94 to $1. 
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti, and EPS growth of 2%. The projected tax rate is 28% compared to 27% a year ago. Compared sequentially to the third quarter just ended, the midpoint of our guidance implies negative revenue and EPS growth of 1% and 4%, respectively. This differs from typical seasonal trends due to the loss of an extra billing day between the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. 
In 2019, we lose 2.4 days sequentially, whereas in 2018, we lost only 1.6 days between quarters.
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's third quarter results and encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and consulting operations. As we noted earlier, Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. Demand for Protiviti's services was broad-based across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions, including its managed solutions offerings provided jointly with our staffing operations. 
Our staffing operations are benefiting from the strong labor market, particularly in the United States. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. The last time the rate was this low was in December 1969.
Staffing challenges are particularly acute for companies that are making technology investments. The skills required for digital transformation projects are in short supply, which is fueling higher demand for specialized staffing services like ours. 
We believe global labor shortages are going to have a durable impact on hiring demand. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index showed a decline in overall confidence among CEOs of small and midsized businesses in September, yet nearly 60% of these CEOs plan to hire in the year ahead, a 4 point increase from the prior month. While many of the various business confidence indices are off their historic highs, they remain at strong absolute levels.
We're focused on technology investments within Robert Half, as we have talked about on this call in the past. Whether customers engage with us online or in person, we can provide a seamless experience supported by technology and the expertise of our local staffing experts. That's a unique combination, which we believe is a key differentiator for Robert Half. 
We also see the blended solutions offered by our staffing and Protiviti operations as an important differentiator. Protiviti's 2019 Global Finance Trends Survey found that managed solutions models, where major projects are handled by a blend of full-time staff, contract professionals and third-party experts, are gaining in popularity as an alternative to traditional outsourcing arrangements. We believe we are uniquely qualified to provide these diverse staffing and consulting solutions all under one roof. 
Now, Keith and I would be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

Client",523,"So our blended solutions did quite well yet again. As Max said earlier, Protiviti's growth was broad-based across all of its solutions areas. Blended solutions, we call managed business solutions, managed technology solutions did particularly well. Clients certainly appreciate the deep subject matter expertise they get from Protiviti and the scalable variable resources they get from staffing, they get that all under one roof. Whether they're building something new, whether they're fixing a problem, whether they're cleaning up a backlog, all 3 are perfect use cases for that blended solution. As far as the development, we think it's early days. Potential, we think, is tremendous. It's clearly for 3 or 4 quarters in a row been one of our fastest-growing operations, and we believe there is a lot of upside from where we are. 
On guidance, maybe we'll just go down the P&L a bit. For revenues with staffing, we're basically seeing year-over-year growth rate staying essentially flat with the third quarter. The U.S. stayed strong. Europe continues to slow, but the comps do get 4 points easier. We're particularly pleased with how we're doing in the U.S. The macro and trade policy uncertainty that's in the news every day seems mostly limited to manufacturing and its supply chain, and we don't have a lot of exposure to that. So we're holding up very well in our judgment in the U.S. Because it's the fourth quarter, there is always calendar anxiety, this year maybe more so than most because the holidays fall on Wednesday. The concern is that more people decide to take the full week off, both candidates and clients, which could have more impact than it typically does. But again, revenue, staffing, year-over-year growth rates essentially flat with Q3.
Revenues Protiviti, they will slow modestly, in part because the comps are the toughest yet, they were up 19% a year ago. In the international zone, they have a couple of large projects that ended. That will take them a little time to replace. Further with Protiviti, because they have been so busy this year, their staff have deferred a lot of their time off. That time off is scheduled heavier in December than is typically the case, partly because of the Wednesday date that I talked about and partly because they just have more deferred time off. That effectively shortens the quarter even more for Protiviti. So some modest slowing in the year-over-year growth rates for Protiviti. Temp gross margin flat to up 20 basis points, Protiviti gross margin down 30 to 50 basis points because of the time off and holiday impact that I just talked about. Effectively they utilize their staff less because of that downtime. 
SG&A, staffing up 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to negative leverage from the international zone. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating leverage due to higher revenues, that means operating income for staffing down 40 to 60 basis points year-on-year. Protiviti up 10 to 30 basis points year-on-year. Tax rate 27.5% to 28%. More nondeductible cost pursuant to the last tax law change. Shares about 115 million."

Further, the candidate supply for Robert Half Management Resources is very different than for Accountemps, as an example. Management Resources have access to a lot of people that have chosen to be contractors or consultants as a career. And that essentially is not the case at all with Accountemps. Further, the Management Resources candidates will travel and clients will pay for that travel, which further helps from a supply point of view.

Now let's review Robert Half's third quarter financial results. Revenues for the company were $1.552 billion, up 6% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter net income per share was $1.01 versus $0.95 in the same period one year ago. This is a 7% increase year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the third quarter, and capital expenditures were $17 million. 
In September, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $80 million. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchases under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
Persistent talent shortages resulted in continued strong demand for our staffing services in the third quarter, particularly in the United States. Robert Half Management Resources was the standout among our staffing lines of business, and our Protiviti subsidiary also had a very strong quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations. Return on invested capital for the company was 42% in the third quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed look at our third quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.552 billion. This is up 6% from the prior year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
On an as adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 3% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $973 million, up 5% on an as-adjusted basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $280 million, down 0.3% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
There were 64.1 billing days in the third quarter versus 63.3 days in the same quarter one year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter one year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.9 percentage points.
Now let's take a look at the results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $299 million, $235 million of that is from the United States and $64 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, Protiviti global revenues were up 15% versus the year ago period.
On an as-adjusted basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were up 16% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.9% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago.
In our permanent placement business, revenues were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter of 2019, which is flat compared to the last year's third quarter. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 10 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter of 44.6%.
Protiviti gross margin was $88 million in the third quarter or 29.5% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 34.1% in last year's third quarter.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 16.2% of Protiviti revenues versus 18.0% of revenues in the year ago period.
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $123 million, operating margin was 9.8%. Of this amount, our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $101 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.1%, while our permanent placement division reported operating income of $22 million and produced an operating margin of 16.2%.
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $40 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%.
Accounts receivable were $853 million at the end of the third quarter and implied days sales outstanding were 49.3 days.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.8% versus the prior year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 4% compared to the same period in October one year ago when revenues were up 9%.
Permanent placement revenues in September were up 0.5% compared to September of 2018. This compares to 3.4% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were essentially flat compared to the same period last year when revenues were up 20%. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: $1.500 billion to $1.565 billion; income per share $0.94 to $1. 
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti, and EPS growth of 2%. The projected tax rate is 28% compared to 27% a year ago. Compared sequentially to the third quarter just ended, the midpoint of our guidance implies negative revenue and EPS growth of 1% and 4%, respectively. This differs from typical seasonal trends due to the loss of an extra billing day between the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. 
In 2019, we lose 2.4 days sequentially, whereas in 2018, we lost only 1.6 days between quarters.
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's third quarter results and encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and consulting operations. As we noted earlier, Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. Demand for Protiviti's services was broad-based across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions, including its managed solutions offerings provided jointly with our staffing operations. 
Our staffing operations are benefiting from the strong labor market, particularly in the United States. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. The last time the rate was this low was in December 1969.
Staffing challenges are particularly acute for companies that are making technology investments. The skills required for digital transformation projects are in short supply, which is fueling higher demand for specialized staffing services like ours. 
We believe global labor shortages are going to have a durable impact on hiring demand. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index showed a decline in overall confidence among CEOs of small and midsized businesses in September, yet nearly 60% of these CEOs plan to hire in the year ahead, a 4 point increase from the prior month. While many of the various business confidence indices are off their historic highs, they remain at strong absolute levels.
We're focused on technology investments within Robert Half, as we have talked about on this call in the past. Whether customers engage with us online or in person, we can provide a seamless experience supported by technology and the expertise of our local staffing experts. That's a unique combination, which we believe is a key differentiator for Robert Half. 
We also see the blended solutions offered by our staffing and Protiviti operations as an important differentiator. Protiviti's 2019 Global Finance Trends Survey found that managed solutions models, where major projects are handled by a blend of full-time staff, contract professionals and third-party experts, are gaining in popularity as an alternative to traditional outsourcing arrangements. We believe we are uniquely qualified to provide these diverse staffing and consulting solutions all under one roof. 
Now, Keith and I would be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

Client",523,"So our blended solutions did quite well yet again. As Max said earlier, Protiviti's growth was broad-based across all of its solutions areas. Blended solutions, we call managed business solutions, managed technology solutions did particularly well. Clients certainly appreciate the deep subject matter expertise they get from Protiviti and the scalable variable resources they get from staffing, they get that all under one roof. Whether they're building something new, whether they're fixing a problem, whether they're cleaning up a backlog, all 3 are perfect use cases for that blended solution. As far as the development, we think it's early days. Potential, we think, is tremendous. It's clearly for 3 or 4 quarters in a row been one of our fastest-growing operations, and we believe there is a lot of upside from where we are. 
On guidance, maybe we'll just go down the P&L a bit. For revenues with staffing, we're basically seeing year-over-year growth rate staying essentially flat with the third quarter. The U.S. stayed strong. Europe continues to slow, but the comps do get 4 points easier. We're particularly pleased with how we're doing in the U.S. The macro and trade policy uncertainty that's in the news every day seems mostly limited to manufacturing and its supply chain, and we don't have a lot of exposure to that. So we're holding up very well in our judgment in the U.S. Because it's the fourth quarter, there is always calendar anxiety, this year maybe more so than most because the holidays fall on Wednesday. The concern is that more people decide to take the full week off, both candidates and clients, which could have more impact than it typically does. But again, revenue, staffing, year-over-year growth rates essentially flat with Q3.
Revenues Protiviti, they will slow modestly, in part because the comps are the toughest yet, they were up 19% a year ago. In the international zone, they have a couple of large projects that ended. That will take them a little time to replace. Further with Protiviti, because they have been so busy this year, their staff have deferred a lot of their time off. That time off is scheduled heavier in December than is typically the case, partly because of the Wednesday date that I talked about and partly because they just have more deferred time off. That effectively shortens the quarter even more for Protiviti. So some modest slowing in the year-over-year growth rates for Protiviti. Temp gross margin flat to up 20 basis points, Protiviti gross margin down 30 to 50 basis points because of the time off and holiday impact that I just talked about. Effectively they utilize their staff less because of that downtime. 
SG&A, staffing up 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to negative leverage from the international zone. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating leverage due to higher revenues, that means operating income for staffing down 40 to 60 basis points year-on-year. Protiviti up 10 to 30 basis points year-on-year. Tax rate 27.5% to 28%. More nondeductible cost pursuant to the last tax law change. Shares about 115 million."

Now let's review Robert Half's third quarter financial results. Revenues for the company were $1.552 billion, up 6% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter net income per share was $1.01 versus $0.95 in the same period one year ago. This is a 7% increase year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the third quarter, and capital expenditures were $17 million. 
In September, we distributed a $0.31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $36 million. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $80 million. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchases under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
Persistent talent shortages resulted in continued strong demand for our staffing services in the third quarter, particularly in the United States. Robert Half Management Resources was the standout among our staffing lines of business, and our Protiviti subsidiary also had a very strong quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations. Return on invested capital for the company was 42% in the third quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a more detailed look at our third quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.552 billion. This is up 6% from the prior year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day constant currency basis from the year ago period.
Accompanying our earnings release today is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as adjusted basis. These figures are further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. The term as adjusted reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
On an as adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 3% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $973 million, up 5% on an as-adjusted basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $280 million, down 0.3% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
There were 64.1 billing days in the third quarter versus 63.3 days in the same quarter one year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter one year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million. This reduced our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.9 percentage points.
Now let's take a look at the results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $299 million, $235 million of that is from the United States and $64 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, Protiviti global revenues were up 15% versus the year ago period.
On an as-adjusted basis, U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were up 16% from the prior year, non-U.S. revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.9% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago.
In our permanent placement business, revenues were 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter of 2019, which is flat compared to the last year's third quarter. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin rose 10 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter of 44.6%.
Protiviti gross margin was $88 million in the third quarter or 29.5% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $71 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 34.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 34.1% in last year's third quarter.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 16.2% of Protiviti revenues versus 18.0% of revenues in the year ago period.
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $123 million, operating margin was 9.8%. Of this amount, our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $101 million in operating income and produced an operating margin of 9.1%, while our permanent placement division reported operating income of $22 million and produced an operating margin of 16.2%.
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $40 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%.
Accounts receivable were $853 million at the end of the third quarter and implied days sales outstanding were 49.3 days.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.8% versus the prior year compared to 3.4% for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 4% compared to the same period in October one year ago when revenues were up 9%.
Permanent placement revenues in September were up 0.5% compared to September of 2018. This compares to 3.4% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were essentially flat compared to the same period last year when revenues were up 20%. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: $1.500 billion to $1.565 billion; income per share $0.94 to $1. 
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti, and EPS growth of 2%. The projected tax rate is 28% compared to 27% a year ago. Compared sequentially to the third quarter just ended, the midpoint of our guidance implies negative revenue and EPS growth of 1% and 4%, respectively. This differs from typical seasonal trends due to the loss of an extra billing day between the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. 
In 2019, we lose 2.4 days sequentially, whereas in 2018, we lost only 1.6 days between quarters.
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's third quarter results and encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our U.S. staffing and consulting operations. As we noted earlier, Protiviti had a particularly strong quarter. Demand for Protiviti's services was broad-based across all of its consulting and internal audit solutions, including its managed solutions offerings provided jointly with our staffing operations. 
Our staffing operations are benefiting from the strong labor market, particularly in the United States. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. The last time the rate was this low was in December 1969.
Staffing challenges are particularly acute for companies that are making technology investments. The skills required for digital transformation projects are in short supply, which is fueling higher demand for specialized staffing services like ours. 
We believe global labor shortages are going to have a durable impact on hiring demand. The Vistage CEO Confidence Index showed a decline in overall confidence among CEOs of small and midsized businesses in September, yet nearly 60% of these CEOs plan to hire in the year ahead, a 4 point increase from the prior month. While many of the various business confidence indices are off their historic highs, they remain at strong absolute levels.
We're focused on technology investments within Robert Half, as we have talked about on this call in the past. Whether customers engage with us online or in person, we can provide a seamless experience supported by technology and the expertise of our local staffing experts. That's a unique combination, which we believe is a key differentiator for Robert Half. 
We also see the blended solutions offered by our staffing and Protiviti operations as an important differentiator. Protiviti's 2019 Global Finance Trends Survey found that managed solutions models, where major projects are handled by a blend of full-time staff, contract professionals and third-party experts, are gaining in popularity as an alternative to traditional outsourcing arrangements. We believe we are uniquely qualified to provide these diverse staffing and consulting solutions all under one roof.

Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the growth that you're seeing in your blended solutions, your managed solutions combination. And where is that in terms of its development? What sort of potential do you see out of that? That's one question. And then the follow-up has to do with the guidance. I'm just wondering, Keith, sometimes you provide some detail with regards to what you are explicitly expecting by segment, both in terms of trends as well as from a margin perspective."

As Max said earlier, Protiviti's growth was broad-based across all of its solutions areas. Blended solutions, we call managed business solutions, managed technology solutions did particularly well. Client",523,"So our blended solutions did quite well yet again. As Max said earlier, Protiviti's growth was broad-based across all of its solutions areas. Blended solutions, we call managed business solutions, managed technology solutions did particularly well. Clients certainly appreciate the deep subject matter expertise they get from Protiviti and the scalable variable resources they get from staffing, they get that all under one roof. Whether they're building something new, whether they're fixing a problem, whether they're cleaning up a backlog, all 3 are perfect use cases for that blended solution. As far as the development, we think it's early days. Potential, we think, is tremendous. It's clearly for 3 or 4 quarters in a row been one of our fastest-growing operations, and we believe there is a lot of upside from where we are. 
On guidance, maybe we'll just go down the P&L a bit. For revenues with staffing, we're basically seeing year-over-year growth rate staying essentially flat with the third quarter. The U.S. stayed strong. Europe continues to slow, but the comps do get 4 points easier. We're particularly pleased with how we're doing in the U.S. The macro and trade policy uncertainty that's in the news every day seems mostly limited to manufacturing and its supply chain, and we don't have a lot of exposure to that. So we're holding up very well in our judgment in the U.S. Because it's the fourth quarter, there is always calendar anxiety, this year maybe more so than most because the holidays fall on Wednesday. The concern is that more people decide to take the full week off, both candidates and clients, which could have more impact than it typically does. But again, revenue, staffing, year-over-year growth rates essentially flat with Q3.
Revenues Protiviti, they will slow modestly, in part because the comps are the toughest yet, they were up 19% a year ago. In the international zone, they have a couple of large projects that ended. That will take them a little time to replace. Further with Protiviti, because they have been so busy this year, their staff have deferred a lot of their time off. That time off is scheduled heavier in December than is typically the case, partly because of the Wednesday date that I talked about and partly because they just have more deferred time off. That effectively shortens the quarter even more for Protiviti. So some modest slowing in the year-over-year growth rates for Protiviti. Temp gross margin flat to up 20 basis points, Protiviti gross margin down 30 to 50 basis points because of the time off and holiday impact that I just talked about. Effectively they utilize their staff less because of that downtime. 
SG&A, staffing up 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to negative leverage from the international zone. Protiviti SG&A down 50 to 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating leverage due to higher revenues, that means operating income for staffing down 40 to 60 basis points year-on-year. Protiviti up 10 to 30 basis points year-on-year. Tax rate 27.5% to 28%. More nondeductible cost pursuant to the last tax law change. Shares about 115 million."

Further, the candidate supply for Robert Half Management Resources is very different than for Accountemps, as an example. Management Resources have access to a lot of people that have chosen to be contractors or consultants as a career. And that essentially is not the case at all with Accountemps. Further, the Management Resources candidates will travel and clients will pay for that travel, which further helps from a supply point of view.
