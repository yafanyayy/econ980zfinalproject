It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, i",2109,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. 
Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our new mindset are clearly fueling improved results. In aggregate for the year, Yum! delivered system-sales growth of 5% with 2% sales same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth, excluding Telepizza units. 
Additionally, 2018 was a year of significant milestones in Bold Restaurant Development. We now have over 48,000 restaurants in approximately 270 brand country combinations. Together with our world-class franchisees, we opened, on average, 8 gross restaurants per day or, in other words, 1 restaurant every 3 hours. 
As for the fourth quarter, I'm thrilled to share details of such a strong finish to a solid year. Items to note include are tremendous quarter at Taco Bell where same-store sales grew 6%; another impressive quarter at KFC, where same-store sales grew 3%; and a continued slow and steady improvement at Pizza Hut U.S. with 1% same-store sales growth. 
Now into the final year of our transformation, we continue to focus on our 4 key drivers to accelerate growth. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. He will also discuss our 2018 results, 2019 guidance and progress towards our transformation commitments. 
I'll begin with our 3 Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands. In the fourth quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. For the year, system sales grew 6% with 2% same-store sales growth and 5% net new unit growth. 
The unit growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations, delivering a record 1,134 net new units this year. This achievement in unit growth was broad-based with particular strength in China, Russia, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. 
KFC also saw a widespread contribution to its 3% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with notable strength in markets like Africa, China and Iberia. Africa continue to deliver results with 7% same-store sales growth in the quarter. This sustained momentum is a result of intense-ed focus on value backed by the introduction of the Zinger, an international fan favorite, and premium innovation like the new Dunk Burger. 
In addition, China reported 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter. This stemmed from transaction driving promotions like that Christmas Bucket and Crazy Thursday Deals and, last but not least, our Iberia market delivered 6% same-store sales growth in 2018. 
Campaigns based on consumer proximity, using delivery aggregators and a standard on the megabucks 5 products for EUR 5 drove the growth. Importantly, each of these markets grew same-store sales growth while accelerating net new-unit development. 
Iberia, for example, opened 35 net new units, a 26% increase in units year-over-year. 
Now to the U.S., where we finished 2018 with our fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We started off the year with the introduction by continuing our taste of the South series with smoking mountain barbecue. We then followed this up with the debut of our Crispy Colonel sandwich in April. 
In the fourth quarter, the team built on these platforms and they build distinctive marketing and product innovation. First, Southern-inspired hot honey chicken was offered in a tenders basket or sandwich style. Second and most notably, chicken and waffles featuring Missus Butterworth syrup was a huge hit. KFC's bold and cheeky marketing uniquely accentuated the delicious pairing to help KFC U.S. deliver strongest month of same-store sales growth for the year. 
With continued focus on value and innovation, we're excited for what 2019 has in store for this Always Original brand. Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division, which celebrated its 60th birthday in 2018 by reaching a milestone of over 18,000 restaurants worldwide. 
This was, in part, due to our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza. David will give you more details on the alliance in a few minutes. I want to note that we close the transaction in December and while there is no significant P&L impact on the quarter, certain Telepizza units were included in the Pizza Hut Division restaurant count. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut Division yield system sales growth of 2%, with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 10% for the quarter or 2%, excluding Telepizza units. 
For the year, systems sales grew 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 10% net new unit growth or 2%, excluding Telepizza units. If you joined us during our Investor and Analyst Day, we mentioned being proud of the foundational improvements we have made, but dissatisfied with the current system sales growth of our Pizza Hut Division. 
For both the U.S. and international business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. 
International Pizza Hut's system sales grew 3% in the quarter to a 5% net new unit growth, excluding Telepizza. We were pleased to see pockets of same-store sales growth progress in the fourth quarter, including in Mexico and Brazil. But overall same-store sales were flat as dine-in sales continued away on overall results. 
As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call and in New York at our Investor Day, the gap between dining channel sales in off-premise is significant, with both the U.S. and international seeing a roughly 10-point differential. About 40% of our units outside of the U.S. are dine in or restaurants with predominantly dine-in sales and about half of these units are in China. 
We are leveraging best practices from our strongest international markets to provide targeted alternative asset solutions. In 2018, we found success in our off-premise focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. Combined, these modern off-premise focused restaurants represents a 90% of total net new units in 2018, with particular success in India, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. 
The addition of nearly 1,300 Telepizza units will accelerate the transformation of our state to a more off-premise focused asset base. In the U.S, system sales increased 1% in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. 
We're encouraged by the operational foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand's position. Over the year, we acquired QuikOrder, our third-party online service provider. Riding our own e-commerce platform will enable us to more quickly provide breakthrough products and convenient services to our customers that will allow for better franchise economics over the long-term. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. continued its emphasis on value, the $5 lineup, which features favorite like a medium 1 top pizza, garlic knots, wings and our new Cinnabon Mini Rolls, help to improve profit and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. 
Our partnership with the NFL has brought attention to these value concepts and improve the distinctiveness of our messaging. Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life. 
Now onto Taco Bell where 2018 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, once again outpacing the industry, a remarkable feat. 
Fourth quarter system sales grew an impressive 9% with system sales growth of 6% and net new unit growth of 3%, a testament to the strength of their leadership team and partnership with their franchisees. 
During the quarter, we doubled down on value in the U.S., with double versions of customer favorites, including the Triple Double Crunchwrap and Double Chalupa. The fan-favorite Rolled Chicken Tacos finish the quarter off strong. 
Taco Bell supported the quarter's value and innovation with distinctive brand moments as well, including celebrating our sixth annual friends giving with exclusive dinner at our innovation Center and launching the Taco Bell taco shop, our online retail channel that features some fantastic holiday-themed swag that sold out in days. 
Both of these events generated top-tier media buzz. As we enter 2019, Taco Bell remains focused on being a Category of One for everyone. 
In addition to our relentless commitment to value and innovation for which Taco Bell is known, in 2019, Taco Bell aims to make it even easier to access -- [indiscernible] access to our customers. In fact, this morning, on the first anniversary of our strategic partnership with Grubhub, Taco Bell officially announced the national launch of Taco Bell delivery in over 4,000 restaurants across the U.S. 
Fans looking to enjoy their favorite menu items at home can jump onto tacobell.com or go directly to grubhub.com or the Grubhub app to place their order. This launch is an important milestone on our journey to make the Taco Bell brand easier to access, and I want to thank the Taco Bell system and the Grubhub team for making this a reality. 
The Taco Bell International, there was a lot to be excited about as well. We took National Taco Day to more than 25 markets to generate awareness and drive sales. We leveraged U.S. product innovation like the Naked Chicken taco in India and Korea and Naked Chicken Chips in the U.K. 
We had solid local innovation like the Crispy Potaco in India, and we even had delivery available in 15 markets and are testing kiosks in several countries. 
Unit growth is gaining momentum, with continued profitable growth in India, Spain and new markets like Peru. In the U.K., development was also strong, including our first 3 stores in London, where we announced our reentry into the market in a way only Taco Bell can, with the help of Big Ben's chimes. 
In 2018, our franchisees committed to over 1,100 international units under development agreements, augmenting our strong pipeline for future growth. This is only the beginning for Taco Bell International and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. 
Now on to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you all saw -- as you all recently saw, the Board of Directors and I unanimously decided to promote David Gibbs to President and Chief Operating Officer. David is a long time young veteran and he's been instrumental in shaping our global strategy, accelerating the pace of global new-unit development, executing our transformation and laying a strong foundation for future growth. 
In his new role, he now has direct oversight of each of the brands with the brand leader's reporting to him. I couldn't be more pleased for David to take on this role and I look forward to his continued contribution and leadership. 
David and I, along with the Board of Directors, have taken a fresh look at our structure and long-term bench as we continue to focus on accelerating our growth. Coming out of that review, we feel great about the level of talent we have throughout the global organization and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. 
This includes the recent promotions of Tony Lowings, as CEO of KFC; Vipul Chawla as President of Pizza Hut International. Additionally, we made the addition to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage for Yum! by investing in select new world-class talent. 
First, and as we've already announced, we'll be hiring a CFO as David assumes his new duties. David will maintain his CFO responsibilities until a new CFO is in place. Second, with technology increasingly at the forefront of our strategic planning efforts and given its importance to all 4 of our growth drivers, we will also be hiring a new senior leader reporting to me, who is focus on global, digital and technology strategy. 
This new role will lead to a coordinated cross plan global effort to better leverage technology, to drive sales and better economics for our franchisees. 
And finally, over the coming quarters, we will also be looking to opportunistically bolster our brand leadership teams. 
In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we are doing around the world, with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!. We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capabil",1884,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
First, our 2018 results. I'm thrilled that we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, particularly reaching the high end of the original range for net new unit growth, which I'll talk about more in a few minutes. 
Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved throughout the year, ultimately achieving 2% and 5%, respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth, ex FX, was 6% at KFC and 6% at Taco Bell, both impressive accomplishments. 
As a reminder, 2 items weighed on our core operating profit results: the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising and the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result, and in line with our expertise, core operating profit growth for the full year was flat. 
As we anticipated, the second half of the year was better than the first. Fourth quarter system sales growth of 6%, same-store sales growth of 3% and core operating profit growth of 5%, each a peak quarterly result for the year. 
Taco Bell was a major contributor to the quarterly improvement with the 9% system sales increase, driven by an impressive 6% same-store sales growth. Not to be left out, KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, ended the year on a high note with 3% same-store sales growth and 5% net unit growth, driving 7% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Before moving on, just a quick update on the impact of our Grubhub investment on EPS. Net for the full year, the mark-to-market of our Grubhub stock had a positive $0.03 impact. In the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market had a negative $0.41 impact. 
We're very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub in the U.S. and the national launch of delivery today with Taco Bell and later this year with KFC. We will continue to update you on the mark-to-market adjustments each quarter. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2019. Consistent with our communications during our Investor and Analyst Day in December, we anticipate net new unit growth of approximately 4% and same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. Our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the rolloff of special media spending in 2018 due to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, rolloff of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business. 
There's no change our guidance from estimated run rate net capital expenditures of $100 million and G&A of 1.7% of system sales in 2019. Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS. Since we issued this guidance in 2016, we have seen continued strong performance at both KFC and Taco Bell, though, clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. Thus, we remain on track to deliver this goal, owing to the benefits of our diverse portfolio. 
As a reminder, the $3.75 does not include any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items we might incur nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
That said, I'd like to provide a little more color on 2 of these items. At this time, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. We also estimate the impact of FX rate movements to be a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. 
This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. We plan to update you on our FX estimates quarterly. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. 
First, being more focused means we are maniacal about our 4 key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% system sales growth. Second, we are pleased to report we have reached our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised, with 856 company units as of the end of 2018. 
Putting this effort into context, from fourth quarter 2016 through 2018, we transferred over 2,300 units in exchange for $2.8 billion in pretax proceeds with over 160 individual deals to 3C franchisee partners who are excited about our future. These partners are committed to providing consistently bold value and our brand strategies, are capable, able to deliver great customer experience and operational standards and finally, have capital, both to grow new units and modernize existing assets. 
Third, we remain on track with our commitment to being more efficient, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales in 2019 and run rate net CapEx of $100 million, as I mentioned earlier. 
As for our goal to returning $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period, 2017 through 2019, we remain firmly on track. During 2018, we repurchased 28 million shares for $2.4 billion at an average price less than $85. 
When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.2 billion through the first 2 years of this program. Additionally, we are pleased to have recently announced our quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 for 2019, representing a 17% increase. 
While on the subject of capital, we're very encouraged by the debt market support for our business model and capital structure. Despite broader market volatility during Q4, we successfully issued $1.45 billion in notes through our Taco Bell whole business securitization. As you know, the securitization market is just one of the multiple markets we access. 
The transaction was well received and over 2.5x oversubscribed. It was upsized and reflects some of the tightest spreads ever obtained through a whole business securitization. Proceeds were used to refinance existing securitization debt and fund a portion of our capital return. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. At the KFC Division, overall customer satisfaction scores increased by 3% during 2018. 
We have continued to invest in our franchise know-how by rolling our operations college across the globe to build capability. The taste of our food is a key differentiator for KFC, therefore, we are increasing our focus on the role of the cook and enhancing standards around the core. 
And lastly, we are continue to make it easier for our customers to enjoy Original Recipe through the continued rollout of click and collect kiosks and delivery. 
Our goal is to have 5,000 restaurants with kiosks and over 70% of our restaurants offering delivery by 2020. Just as promising these enhancements are occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize the existing assets. 
At Pizza Hut U.S., the team and franchise partners have made improvements in 3 key areas of the customer experience. First by delivering a hot, fast and reliable pizza. We have improved our average delivery time by 3 minutes and increased customer satisfaction scores. Second, since the kickoff of Hut Rewards and updates to our mobile app in late 2017, we've been squarely in the digital game. We have over 12 million active users in the loyalty program and hope to be adding more as our off-line channel gains momentum. It's an impressive achievement considering we rolled out the program in the second half of 2017. 
Pizza Hut also announced during the fourth quarter that for first time ever, Hut Rewards members can earn points for in-store purchases. The brand truly doubled down last year with 2 points awarded for every dollar spent. 
At Taco Bell, Julie Masino is doing a fantastic job leading the U.S. division and working with our franchise partners. Their focus on excellent execution is generating operating profit growth while offering customers faster service and a better experience. 
In fact, the speed of service has improved 3 seconds at lunch and 2 seconds at dinner Q4 year-over-year. Unlocking transactions and sales growth during peak service hours, which helped drive over 4 million additional transactions during the quarter. Their results show that our franchisees have really embraced our initiative of easy, and we are excited for what 2019 holds for this cult favorite. 
Next, let's talk about Bold Restaurant Development. During 2018, we opened 3,021 gross restaurants and 1,758 on a net basis, excluding Telepizza, which I will talk about next. This is truly a step change in pace representing an approximately 50% increase in net new unit growth from 2016. 
This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset, which you've consistently heard as discussed, can generate improved results. There is no single driver of the increase but rather a holistic approach toward unlocking profitable franchisee-lead development supported by improved unit-level economics. 
We are very proud of the teams and franchisees that are making this happen and believe that by leveraging our scale and expanding our capabilities, we can continue to improve franchisee new unit economics, which we all know drive unit growth long-term. 
Before we move on to Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. This landmark deal places Pizza Hut in the #1 position within the category across Latin America and Iberia in terms of unit count, confirming Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. 
As the deal closed in December, it had no significant impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. 1,282 Telepizza units are now included in our new master franchise agreement with Telepizza and are included in our overall unit count and have begun paying a fee to Pizza Hut. 
Of these stores, we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap. Finally, there is an ancillary agreement for another 126 restaurants that are not included in the master franchise agreement. 
These non-MFA restaurants will effectively pay a small fee to Pizza Hut, but will not be included in the unit count unless and until they are converted in the Pizza Hut brand. 
Postclosing, our state transformed to nearly 90% off-premise focused assets within the Telepizza regions. We are excited for what this means for development as Telepizza has agreed to add least 2,500 units to the alliance over the next 20 years. 
To summarize, the transformation we started in 2016 is already making Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. We achieved our goal of 98% of restaurants being owned and operated by franchisees and they're on track to deliver our commitments for the transformation. 
With 3 category brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale, expanding digital technology and delivery. 
We look forward to updating you throughout 2019. Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

Yes, it think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as I've -- clearly the most likely outcome we see. With -- Embedded within that guidance is normal is tailwinds and possible headwinds. From a tailwind standpoint and getting out your question about regions of growth, we really encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread development. If you look back at years passed, a lot of our successful years in development, none of which reach the levels we reach this year, were driven by China. But this year, China has played a more smaller role in us achieving what is a record for Yum! on units because around the world, we are seeing good unit-level economics, which is driving our franchisees to build more stores, we're spending more time supporting them in this effort and making sure that they're picking the right locations with more sophisticated market planning tools and that -- and being as efficient as possible with our capital spent. So we've got some great tailwinds and as the development program is becoming more widespread and cuts across really just about every market that we operate in. As far as possible headwinds for 2019, we have this transition of the Pizza Hut dine in estate to a more delivery focused estate and that involves closing and opening stores. And during that churn, we may see more closures perhaps that we anticipated in the short-term at Pizza Hut. So that's something as a possible headwind that we'll keep our eyes on. And then I guess the other possible headwind for those of you who listen to the Yum China call, is their guidance for 2019 would imply a deceleration in unit development for them, although their guidance was consistent with their guidance from last year. So another thing to just keep an eye on is the number of units coming out of Yum China. And then I think there's a final point on development, not considered in the guidance, likely not a big issue, is what I talked about with Telepizza. There's a potential for 100 to 150 units, that's our best guess right now, to close between Telepizza and Pizza Hut where there is overlap in a particular trade area. Obviously, there's going to be a lot more work that needs to be done to dig into that to identify exactly which stores would stay open and how that all plays out. But at the same time, I also highlighted there's 126 units that are not in our unit count today because they're not in the MFA, but our Telepizza stores that have the potential of being added to our unit count. So those 2 things are potentially could roughly offset each other. They're not really considered in the guidance but as we learn more about those stores and overlaps and additions, we'll, obviously, update you on this quarterly call. As far as your final question on the Telepizza transaction and do we have more of those in the hopper. What I would say is we really pleased with the Telepizza acquisition. The management of the Telepizza business is first class. We love having them now has a master franchisee in the Yum! world, and we think that is a template for more deals that we can do, and we know that all of our brands are out there looking for deals like that. So lot of people who want to join the system, and we hope to take advantage of that, be selective in adding the right people, but certainly something that we hope to have more news for down the road. I would just end on the development front by saying, there's strong momentum in the business. Our tools for development are getting more and more sophisticated as we can parse data to figure out to where to put stores to be the most profitable and it's widespread momentum. And as you've seen so far, the surprises tend to be on the upside, so we're excited about development going into 2019."

That team, led by Julie Masino, is just doing a great job across the board. We are known as the value leader, we are known as the innovation leader, as David said, we're running great operations. The assets are in great shape. The franchisees like their restaurant-level margins, and so I think when you add all that up, you just get a performance, a consistent performance for the 7 years that Taco Bell has delivered and we believe will continue to deliver. So the brand is in great check, even the delivery advertising, which were launched today, I had a chance -- we are at the Taco Bell a couple of weeks ago, I've seen all the marketing around the advertising supporting the Grubhub launch. It's as good as any work I've ever seen come out of Taco Bell. So if we can accelerate our growth in delivery, I think that's all positive. So they're just doing everything right, led by a great executive team and a great president."

We don't want to go out and blow out without the integration because we know that with great integration, it improves speed to service, it improves order accuracy, it does everything what the customer wants. And so you can say we've got a little slow, I would say we've gone a little slower early in order to accelerate going forward. So I'm very excited about the launch date at Taco Bell. I'm very excited that more KFC restaurants will come onboard before the end of 2019 and all indications are certainly in the early days, high check, incremental transactions, all of that bodes well for both brands in the U.S."

It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, i",2109,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. 
Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our new mindset are clearly fueling improved results. In aggregate for the year, Yum! delivered system-sales growth of 5% with 2% sales same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth, excluding Telepizza units. 
Additionally, 2018 was a year of significant milestones in Bold Restaurant Development. We now have over 48,000 restaurants in approximately 270 brand country combinations. Together with our world-class franchisees, we opened, on average, 8 gross restaurants per day or, in other words, 1 restaurant every 3 hours. 
As for the fourth quarter, I'm thrilled to share details of such a strong finish to a solid year. Items to note include are tremendous quarter at Taco Bell where same-store sales grew 6%; another impressive quarter at KFC, where same-store sales grew 3%; and a continued slow and steady improvement at Pizza Hut U.S. with 1% same-store sales growth. 
Now into the final year of our transformation, we continue to focus on our 4 key drivers to accelerate growth. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. He will also discuss our 2018 results, 2019 guidance and progress towards our transformation commitments. 
I'll begin with our 3 Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands. In the fourth quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. For the year, system sales grew 6% with 2% same-store sales growth and 5% net new unit growth. 
The unit growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations, delivering a record 1,134 net new units this year. This achievement in unit growth was broad-based with particular strength in China, Russia, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. 
KFC also saw a widespread contribution to its 3% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with notable strength in markets like Africa, China and Iberia. Africa continue to deliver results with 7% same-store sales growth in the quarter. This sustained momentum is a result of intense-ed focus on value backed by the introduction of the Zinger, an international fan favorite, and premium innovation like the new Dunk Burger. 
In addition, China reported 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter. This stemmed from transaction driving promotions like that Christmas Bucket and Crazy Thursday Deals and, last but not least, our Iberia market delivered 6% same-store sales growth in 2018. 
Campaigns based on consumer proximity, using delivery aggregators and a standard on the megabucks 5 products for EUR 5 drove the growth. Importantly, each of these markets grew same-store sales growth while accelerating net new-unit development. 
Iberia, for example, opened 35 net new units, a 26% increase in units year-over-year. 
Now to the U.S., where we finished 2018 with our fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We started off the year with the introduction by continuing our taste of the South series with smoking mountain barbecue. We then followed this up with the debut of our Crispy Colonel sandwich in April. 
In the fourth quarter, the team built on these platforms and they build distinctive marketing and product innovation. First, Southern-inspired hot honey chicken was offered in a tenders basket or sandwich style. Second and most notably, chicken and waffles featuring Missus Butterworth syrup was a huge hit. KFC's bold and cheeky marketing uniquely accentuated the delicious pairing to help KFC U.S. deliver strongest month of same-store sales growth for the year. 
With continued focus on value and innovation, we're excited for what 2019 has in store for this Always Original brand. Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division, which celebrated its 60th birthday in 2018 by reaching a milestone of over 18,000 restaurants worldwide. 
This was, in part, due to our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza. David will give you more details on the alliance in a few minutes. I want to note that we close the transaction in December and while there is no significant P&L impact on the quarter, certain Telepizza units were included in the Pizza Hut Division restaurant count. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut Division yield system sales growth of 2%, with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 10% for the quarter or 2%, excluding Telepizza units. 
For the year, systems sales grew 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 10% net new unit growth or 2%, excluding Telepizza units. If you joined us during our Investor and Analyst Day, we mentioned being proud of the foundational improvements we have made, but dissatisfied with the current system sales growth of our Pizza Hut Division. 
For both the U.S. and international business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. 
International Pizza Hut's system sales grew 3% in the quarter to a 5% net new unit growth, excluding Telepizza. We were pleased to see pockets of same-store sales growth progress in the fourth quarter, including in Mexico and Brazil. But overall same-store sales were flat as dine-in sales continued away on overall results. 
As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call and in New York at our Investor Day, the gap between dining channel sales in off-premise is significant, with both the U.S. and international seeing a roughly 10-point differential. About 40% of our units outside of the U.S. are dine in or restaurants with predominantly dine-in sales and about half of these units are in China. 
We are leveraging best practices from our strongest international markets to provide targeted alternative asset solutions. In 2018, we found success in our off-premise focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. Combined, these modern off-premise focused restaurants represents a 90% of total net new units in 2018, with particular success in India, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. 
The addition of nearly 1,300 Telepizza units will accelerate the transformation of our state to a more off-premise focused asset base. In the U.S, system sales increased 1% in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. 
We're encouraged by the operational foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand's position. Over the year, we acquired QuikOrder, our third-party online service provider. Riding our own e-commerce platform will enable us to more quickly provide breakthrough products and convenient services to our customers that will allow for better franchise economics over the long-term. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. continued its emphasis on value, the $5 lineup, which features favorite like a medium 1 top pizza, garlic knots, wings and our new Cinnabon Mini Rolls, help to improve profit and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. 
Our partnership with the NFL has brought attention to these value concepts and improve the distinctiveness of our messaging. Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life. 
Now onto Taco Bell where 2018 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, once again outpacing the industry, a remarkable feat. 
Fourth quarter system sales grew an impressive 9% with system sales growth of 6% and net new unit growth of 3%, a testament to the strength of their leadership team and partnership with their franchisees. 
During the quarter, we doubled down on value in the U.S., with double versions of customer favorites, including the Triple Double Crunchwrap and Double Chalupa. The fan-favorite Rolled Chicken Tacos finish the quarter off strong. 
Taco Bell supported the quarter's value and innovation with distinctive brand moments as well, including celebrating our sixth annual friends giving with exclusive dinner at our innovation Center and launching the Taco Bell taco shop, our online retail channel that features some fantastic holiday-themed swag that sold out in days. 
Both of these events generated top-tier media buzz. As we enter 2019, Taco Bell remains focused on being a Category of One for everyone. 
In addition to our relentless commitment to value and innovation for which Taco Bell is known, in 2019, Taco Bell aims to make it even easier to access -- [indiscernible] access to our customers. In fact, this morning, on the first anniversary of our strategic partnership with Grubhub, Taco Bell officially announced the national launch of Taco Bell delivery in over 4,000 restaurants across the U.S. 
Fans looking to enjoy their favorite menu items at home can jump onto tacobell.com or go directly to grubhub.com or the Grubhub app to place their order. This launch is an important milestone on our journey to make the Taco Bell brand easier to access, and I want to thank the Taco Bell system and the Grubhub team for making this a reality. 
The Taco Bell International, there was a lot to be excited about as well. We took National Taco Day to more than 25 markets to generate awareness and drive sales. We leveraged U.S. product innovation like the Naked Chicken taco in India and Korea and Naked Chicken Chips in the U.K. 
We had solid local innovation like the Crispy Potaco in India, and we even had delivery available in 15 markets and are testing kiosks in several countries. 
Unit growth is gaining momentum, with continued profitable growth in India, Spain and new markets like Peru. In the U.K., development was also strong, including our first 3 stores in London, where we announced our reentry into the market in a way only Taco Bell can, with the help of Big Ben's chimes. 
In 2018, our franchisees committed to over 1,100 international units under development agreements, augmenting our strong pipeline for future growth. This is only the beginning for Taco Bell International and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. 
Now on to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you all saw -- as you all recently saw, the Board of Directors and I unanimously decided to promote David Gibbs to President and Chief Operating Officer. David is a long time young veteran and he's been instrumental in shaping our global strategy, accelerating the pace of global new-unit development, executing our transformation and laying a strong foundation for future growth. 
In his new role, he now has direct oversight of each of the brands with the brand leader's reporting to him. I couldn't be more pleased for David to take on this role and I look forward to his continued contribution and leadership. 
David and I, along with the Board of Directors, have taken a fresh look at our structure and long-term bench as we continue to focus on accelerating our growth. Coming out of that review, we feel great about the level of talent we have throughout the global organization and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. 
This includes the recent promotions of Tony Lowings, as CEO of KFC; Vipul Chawla as President of Pizza Hut International. Additionally, we made the addition to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage for Yum! by investing in select new world-class talent. 
First, and as we've already announced, we'll be hiring a CFO as David assumes his new duties. David will maintain his CFO responsibilities until a new CFO is in place. Second, with technology increasingly at the forefront of our strategic planning efforts and given its importance to all 4 of our growth drivers, we will also be hiring a new senior leader reporting to me, who is focus on global, digital and technology strategy. 
This new role will lead to a coordinated cross plan global effort to better leverage technology, to drive sales and better economics for our franchisees. 
And finally, over the coming quarters, we will also be looking to opportunistically bolster our brand leadership teams. 
In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we are doing around the world, with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!. We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
First, our 2018 results. I'm thrilled that we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, particularly reaching the high end of the original range for net new unit growth, which I'll talk about more in a few minutes. 
Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved throughout the year, ultimately achieving 2% and 5%, respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth, ex FX, was 6% at KFC and 6% at Taco Bell, both impressive accomplishments. 
As a reminder, 2 items weighed on our core operating profit results: the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising and the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result, and in line with our expertise, core operating profit growth for the full year was flat. 
As we anticipated, the second half of the year was better than the first. Fourth quarter system sales growth of 6%, same-store sales growth of 3% and core operating profit growth of 5%, each a peak quarterly result for the year. 
Taco Bell was a major contributor to the quarterly improvement with the 9% system sales increase, driven by an impressive 6% same-store sales growth. Not to be left out, KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, ended the year on a high note with 3% same-store sales growth and 5% net unit growth, driving 7% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Before moving on, just a quick update on the impact of our Grubhub investment on EPS. Net for the full year, the mark-to-market of our Grubhub stock had a positive $0.03 impact. In the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market had a negative $0.41 impact. 
We're very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub in the U.S. and the national launch of delivery today with Taco Bell and later this year with KFC. We will continue to update you on the mark-to-market adjustments each quarter. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2019. Consistent with our communications during our Investor and Analyst Day in December, we anticipate net new unit growth of approximately 4% and same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. Our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the rolloff of special media spending in 2018 due to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, rolloff of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business. 
There's no change our guidance from estimated run rate net capital expenditures of $100 million and G&A of 1.7% of system sales in 2019. Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS. Since we issued this guidance in 2016, we have seen continued strong performance at both KFC and Taco Bell, though, clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. Thus, we remain on track to deliver this goal, owing to the benefits of our diverse portfolio. 
As a reminder, the $3.75 does not include any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items we might incur nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
That said, I'd like to provide a little more color on 2 of these items. At this time, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. We also estimate the impact of FX rate movements to be a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. 
This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. We plan to update you on our FX estimates quarterly. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. 
First, being more focused means we are maniacal about our 4 key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% system sales growth. Second, we are pleased to report we have reached our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised, with 856 company units as of the end of 2018. 
Putting this effort into context, from fourth quarter 2016 through 2018, we transferred over 2,300 units in exchange for $2.8 billion in pretax proceeds with over 160 individual deals to 3C franchisee partners who are excited about our future. These partners are committed to providing consistently bold value and our brand strategies, are capable, able to deliver great customer experience and operational standards and finally, have capital, both to grow new units and modernize existing assets. 
Third, we remain on track with our commitment to being more efficient, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales in 2019 and run rate net CapEx of $100 million, as I mentioned earlier. 
As for our goal to returning $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period, 2017 through 2019, we remain firmly on track. During 2018, we repurchased 28 million shares for $2.4 billion at an average price less than $85. 
When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.2 billion through the first 2 years of this program. Additionally, we are pleased to have recently announced our quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 for 2019, representing a 17% increase. 
While on the subject of capital, we're very encouraged by the debt market support for our business model and capital structure. Despite broader market volatility during Q4, we successfully issued $1.45 billion in notes through our Taco Bell whole business securitization. As you know, the securitization market is just one of the multiple markets we access. 
The transaction was well received and over 2.5x oversubscribed. It was upsized and reflects some of the tightest spreads ever obtained through a whole business securitization. Proceeds were used to refinance existing securitization debt and fund a portion of our capital return. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. At the KFC Division, overall customer satisfaction scores increased by 3% during 2018. 
We have continued to invest in our franchise know-how by rolling our operations college across the globe to build capability. The taste of our food is a key differentiator for KFC, therefore, we are increasing our focus on the role of the cook and enhancing standards around the core. 
And lastly, we are continue to make it easier for our customers to enjoy Original Recipe through the continued rollout of click and collect kiosks and delivery. 
Our goal is to have 5,000 restaurants with kiosks and over 70% of our restaurants offering delivery by 2020. Just as promising these enhancements are occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize the existing assets. 
At Pizza Hut U.S., the team and franchise partners have made improvements in 3 key areas of the customer experience. First by delivering a hot, fast and reliable pizza. We have improved our average delivery time by 3 minutes and increased customer satisfaction scores. Second, since the kickoff of Hut Rewards and updates to our mobile app in late 2017, we've been squarely in the digital game. We have over 12 million active users in the loyalty program and hope to be adding more as our off-line channel gains momentum. It's an impressive achievement considering we rolled out the program in the second half of 2017. 
Pizza Hut also announced during the fourth quarter that for first time ever, Hut Rewards members can earn points for in-store purchases. The brand truly doubled down last year with 2 points awarded for every dollar spent. 
At Taco Bell, Julie Masino is doing a fantastic job leading the U.S. division and working with our franchise partners. Their focus on excellent execution is generating operating profit growth while offering customers faster service and a better experience. 
In fact, the speed of service has improved 3 seconds at lunch and 2 seconds at dinner Q4 year-over-year. Unlocking transactions and sales growth during peak service hours, which helped drive over 4 million additional transactions during the quarter. Their results show that our franchisees have really embraced our initiative of easy, and we are excited for what 2019 holds for this cult favorite. 
Next, let's talk about Bold Restaurant Development. During 2018, we opened 3,021 gross restaurants and 1,758 on a net basis, excluding Telepizza, which I will talk about next. This is truly a step change in pace representing an approximately 50% increase in net new unit growth from 2016. 
This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset, which you've consistently heard as discussed, can generate improved results. There is no single driver of the increase but rather a holistic approach toward unlocking profitable franchisee-lead development supported by improved unit-level economics. 
We are very proud of the teams and franchisees that are making this happen and believe that by leveraging our scale and expanding our capabilities, we can continue to improve franchisee new unit economics, which we all know drive unit growth long-term. 
Before we move on to Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. This landmark deal places Pizza Hut in the #1 position within the category across Latin America and Iberia in terms of unit count, confirming Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. 
As the deal closed in December, it had no significant impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. 1,282 Telepizza units are now included in our new master franchise agreement with Telepizza and are included in our overall unit count and have begun paying a fee to Pizza Hut. 
Of these stores, we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap. Finally, there is an ancillary agreement for another 126 restaurants that are not included in the master franchise agreement. 
These non-MFA restaurants will effectively pay a small fee to Pizza Hut, but will not be included in the unit count unless and until they are converted in the Pizza Hut brand. 
Postclosing, our state transformed to nearly 90% off-premise focused assets within the Telepizza regions. We are excited for what this means for development as Telepizza has agreed to add least 2,500 units to the alliance over the next 20 years. 
To summarize, the transformation we started in 2016 is already making Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. We achieved our goal of 98% of restaurants being owned and operated by franchisees and they're on track to deliver our commitments for the transformation. 
With 3 category brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale, expanding digital technology and delivery. 
We look forward to updating you throughout 2019. Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

Yes, it think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as I've -- clearly the most likely outcome we see. With -- Embedded within that guidance is normal is tailwinds and possible headwinds. From a tailwind standpoint and getting out your question about regions of growth, we really encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread development. If you look back at years passed, a lot of our successful years in development, none of which reach the levels we reach this year, were driven by China. But this year, China has played a more smaller role in us achieving what is a record for Yum! on units because around the world, we are seeing good unit-level economics, which is driving our franchisees to build more stores, we're spending more time supporting them in this effort and making sure that they're picking the right locations with more sophisticated market planning tools and that -- and being as efficient as possible with our capital spent. So we've got some great tailwinds and as the development program is becoming more widespread and cuts across really just about every market that we operate in. As far as possible headwinds for 2019, we have this transition of the Pizza Hut dine in estate to a more delivery focused estate and that involves closing and opening stores. And during that churn, we may see more closures perhaps that we anticipated in the short-term at Pizza Hut. So that's something as a possible headwind that we'll keep our eyes on. And then I guess the other possible headwind for those of you who listen to the Yum China call, is their guidance for 2019 would imply a deceleration in unit development for them, although their guidance was consistent with their guidance from last year. So another thing to just keep an eye on is the number of units coming out of Yum China. And then I think there's a final point on development, not considered in the guidance, likely not a big issue, is what I talked about with Telepizza. There's a potential for 100 to 150 units, that's our best guess right now, to close between Telepizza and Pizza Hut where there is overlap in a particular trade area. Obviously, there's going to be a lot more work that needs to be done to dig into that to identify exactly which stores would stay open and how that all plays out. But at the same time, I also highlighted there's 126 units that are not in our unit count today because they're not in the MFA, but our Telepizza stores that have the potential of being added to our unit count. So those 2 things are potentially could roughly offset each other. They're not really considered in the guidance but as we learn more about those stores and overlaps and additions, we'll, obviously, update you on this quarterly call. As far as your final question on the Telepizza transaction and do we have more of those in the hopper. What I would say is we really pleased with the Telepizza acquisition. The management of the Telepizza business is first class. We love having them now has a master franchisee in the Yum! world, and we think that is a template for more deals that we can do, and we know that all of our brands are out there looking for deals like that. So lot of people who want to join the system, and we hope to take advantage of that, be selective in adding the right people, but certainly something that we hope to have more news for down the road. I would just end on the development front by saying, there's strong momentum in the business. Our tools for development are getting more and more sophisticated as we can parse data to figure out to where to put stores to be the most profitable and it's widespread momentum. And as you've seen so far, the surprises tend to be on the upside, so we're excited about development going into 2019."

365997,573585744,1649574,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2019",2019-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, inc",2108,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and a new mindset are clearly fueling improved results. In aggregate for the year, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 5% with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth, excluding Telepizza units. 
Additionally, 2018 was a year of significant milestones in Bold Restaurant Development. We now have over 48,000 restaurants in approximately 270 brand-country combinations. Together with our world-class franchisees, we opened, on average, 8 gross restaurants per day or, in other words, 1 restaurant every 3 hours. 
As for the fourth quarter, I'm thrilled to share details of such a strong finish to a solid year. Items to note include a tremendous quarter at Taco Bell where same-store sales grew 6%; another impressive quarter at KFC, where same-store sales grew 3%; and a continued slow and steady improvement at Pizza Hut U.S. with 1% same-store sales growth. 
Now into the final year of our transformation, we continue to focus on our 4 key drivers to accelerate growth. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. He will also discuss our 2018 results, 2019 guidance and progress towards our transformation commitments. 
I'll begin with our 3 Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands. In the fourth quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. For the year, system sales grew 6% with 2% same-store sales growth and 5% net new unit growth. 
The unit growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations, delivering a record 1,134 net new units this year. This achievement in unit growth was broad-based with particular strength in China, Russia, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. 
KFC also saw widespread contribution to its 3% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with notable strength in markets like Africa, China and Iberia. Africa continued to deliver results with 7% same-store sales growth in the quarter. This sustained momentum is a result of intense focus on value backed by the introduction of the Zinger, an international fan favorite, and premium innovation like the new Dunked burger. 
In addition, China reported 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter. This stemmed from transaction-driving promotions like the Christmas Bucket and Crazy Thursday deals. And last but not least, our Iberia market delivered 6% same-store sales growth in 2018. Campaigns based on consumer proximity using delivery aggregators and have centered on the Mega Box 5 products for EUR 5 drove the growth. Importantly, each of these markets grew same-store sales growth while accelerating net new unit development. Iberia, for example, opened 35 net new units, a 26% increase in units year-over-year. 
Now to the U.S., where we finished 2018 with our fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We started off the year with the introduction (sic) [ innovation ] by continuing our Taste of the South series with Smokey Mountain BBQ. We then followed this up with the debut of our Crispy Colonel sandwich in April. 
In the fourth quarter, the team built on these platforms and debuted distinctive marketing and product innovation. First, Southern-inspired Hot Honey Chicken was offered in a tenders basket or sandwich style. Second and most notably, chicken and waffles featuring Mrs. Butterworth syrup was a huge hit. KFC's bold and cheeky marketing uniquely accentuated the delicious pairing to help KFC U.S. deliver its strongest month of same-store sales growth for the year. With continued focus on value and innovation, we're excited for what 2019 has in store for this Always Original brand. 
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division, which celebrated its 60th birthday in 2018 by reaching a milestone of over 18,000 restaurants worldwide. This was, in part, due to our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza. David will give you more details on the alliance in a few minutes. I want to note that we closed the transaction in December and while there is no significant P&L impact on the quarter, certain Telepizza units were included in the Pizza Hut Division restaurant count. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut Division yielded system sales growth of 2%, with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 10% for the quarter or 2%, excluding Telepizza units. For the year, systems sales grew 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 10% net new unit growth or 2%, excluding Telepizza units. 
If you joined us during our Investor and Analyst Day, we mentioned being proud of the foundational improvements we have made, but dissatisfied with the current system sales growth of our Pizza Hut Division. For both the U.S. and international business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. 
International Pizza Hut system sales grew 3% in the quarter due to a 5% net new unit growth, excluding Telepizza. We were pleased to see pockets of same-store sales growth progress in the fourth quarter, including in Mexico and Brazil. But overall same-store sales were flat as dine-in sales continued to weigh on overall results. 
As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call and in New York at our Investor Day, the gap between dine-in channel sales and off-premise is significant, with both the U.S. and international seeing a roughly 10-point differential. About 40% of our units outside of the U.S. are dine-in restaurants with predominantly dine-in sales, and about half of these units are in China. We are leveraging best practices from our strongest international markets to provide targeted alternative asset solutions. 
In 2018, we found success in our off-premise-focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. Combined, these modern off-premise-focused restaurants represented 90% of total net new units in 2018, with particular success in India, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. The addition of nearly 1,300 Telepizza units will accelerate the transformation of our estate to a more off-premise-focused asset base. 
In the U.S, system sales increased 1% in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. We're encouraged by the operational foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand's position. Over the year, we acquired QuikOrder, our third-party online service provider. Running our own e-commerce platform will enable us to more quickly provide breakthrough products and convenient services to our customers that will allow for better franchise economics over the long term. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. continued its emphasis on value. The $5 lineup, which features favorites like a medium 1-top pizza, Garlic Knots, wings and our new Cinnabon Mini Rolls, helped improve traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. 
Our partnership with the NFL has brought attention to these value concepts and improve the distinctiveness of our messaging. Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand, and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life. 
Now on to Taco Bell, where 2018 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, once again outpacing the industry, a remarkable feat. Fourth quarter system sales grew an impressive 9%, with system (sic) [ same-store ] sales growth of 6% and net new unit growth of 3%, a testament to the strength of their leadership team and partnership with their franchisees. 
During the quarter, we doubled down on value in the U.S., with double versions of customer favorites, including the Triple Double Crunchwrap and Double Chalupa. Then fan-favorite Rolled Chicken Tacos finished the quarter off strong. 
Taco Bell supported the quarter's value and innovation with distinctive brand moments as well, including celebrating our sixth annual Friendsgiving with an exclusive dinner at our innovation center and launching the Taco Bell Taco Shop, our online retail channel that features some fantastic holiday-themed swag that sold out in days. Both of these events generated top-tier media buzz. As we enter 2019, Taco Bell remains focused on being a Category of One for everyone. 
In addition to our relentless commitment to value and innovation for which Taco Bell is known, in 2019, Taco Bell aims to make it even easier to access for our customers. In fact, this morning, on the first anniversary of our strategic partnership with Grubhub, Taco Bell officially announced the national launch of Taco Bell delivery in over 4,000 restaurants across the U.S. Fans looking to enjoy their favorite menu items at home can jump onto tacobell.com or go directly to grubhub.com or the Grubhub app to place their order. This launch is an important milestone on our journey to make the Taco Bell brand easier to access, and I want to thank the Taco Bell system and the Grubhub team for making this a reality. 
With Taco Bell International, there was a lot to be excited about as well. We took National Taco Day to more than 25 markets to generate awareness and drive sales. We leveraged U.S. product innovation, like the Naked Chicken Taco in India and Korea and Naked Chicken Chips in the U.K. We had solid local innovation, like the Crispy Potaco in India, and we even have delivery available in 15 markets and are testing kiosks in several countries. 
 
Unit growth is gaining momentum, with continued profitable growth in India, Spain and new markets like Peru. In the U.K., development was also strong, including our first 3 stores in London, where we announced our reentry into the market in a way only Taco Bell can, with the help of Big Ben's chimes. 
In 2018, our franchisees committed to over 1,100 international units under development agreements, augmenting our strong pipeline for future growth. This is only the beginning for Taco Bell International, and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. 
Now on to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you all saw -- as you all recently saw, the Board of Directors and I unanimously decided to promote David Gibbs to President and Chief Operating Officer. David is a long-time Yum! veteran, and he's been instrumental in shaping our global strategy, accelerating the pace of global new unit development, executing our transformation and laying a strong foundation for future growth. In his new role, he now has direct oversight of each of the brands with the brand leaders reporting to him. I couldn't be more pleased for David to take on this role, and I look forward to his continued contribution and leadership. 
David and I, along with the Board of Directors, have taken a fresh look at our structure and long-term bench as we continue to focus on accelerating our growth. Coming out of that review, we feel great about the level of talent we have throughout the global organization and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. 
This includes the recent promotions of Tony Lowings, as CEO of KFC; Vipul Chawla as President of Pizza Hut International. Additionally, we made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage for Yum! by investing in select, new world-class talent. 
First, and as we've already announced, we'll be hiring a CFO as David assumes his new duties. David will maintain his CFO responsibilities until a new CFO is in place. Second, with technology increasingly at the forefront of our strategic planning efforts, and given its importance to all 4 of our growth drivers, we will also be hiring a new senior leader reporting to me, who is focused on global, digital and technology strategy. This new role will lead to a coordinated cross-brand global effort to better leverage technology to drive sales and better economics for our franchisees. And finally, over the coming quarters, we will also be looking to opportunistically bolster our brand leadership teams. 
In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we are doing around the world, with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum! We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformational strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,573585744,1649574,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2019",2019-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capabil",1886,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
First, our 2018 results. I'm thrilled that we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, particularly reaching the high end of the original range for net new unit growth, which I'll talk about more in a few minutes. 
Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved throughout the year, ultimately achieving 2% and 5%, respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth, ex FX, was 6% at KFC and 6% at Taco Bell, both impressive accomplishments. 
As a reminder, 2 items weighed on our core operating profit results: the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising, and the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result, and in line with our expertise, core operating profit growth for the full year was flat. As we anticipated, the second half of the year was better than the first: fourth quarter system sales growth of 6%, same-store sales growth of 3% and core operating profit growth of 5%, each a peak quarterly result for the year. 
Taco Bell was a major contributor to the quarterly improvement with a 9% system sales increase, driven by an impressive 6% same-store sales growth. Not to be left out, KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, ended the year on a high note with 3% same-store sales growth and 5% net unit growth, driving 7% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Before moving on, just a quick update on the impact of our Grubhub investment on EPS. Net for the full year, the mark-to-market of our Grubhub stock had a positive $0.03 impact. In the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market had a negative $0.41 impact. 
We're very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub in the U.S. and the national launch of delivery today with Taco Bell and later this year with KFC. We will continue to update you on the mark-to-market adjustments each quarter. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2019. Consistent with our communications during our Investor and Analyst Day in December, we anticipate net new unit growth of approximately 4% and same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. Our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the roll off of special media spending in 2018 due to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, roll off of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business. There's no change to our guidance from estimated run rate net capital expenditures of $100 million and G&A of 1.7% of system sales in 2019. 
Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS. Since we issued this guidance in 2016, we have seen continued strong performance at both KFC and Taco Bell, though clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. Thus, we remain on track to deliver this goal, owing to the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As a reminder, the $3.75 does not include any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items we might incur nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
That said, I'd like to provide a little more color on 2 of these items. At this time, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. We also estimate the impact of FX rate movements to be a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. We plan to update you on our FX estimates quarterly. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused means we are maniacal about our 4 key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% system sales growth. Second, we are pleased to report we have reached our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised, with 856 company units as of the end of 2018. 
Putting this effort into context, from fourth quarter 2016 through 2018, we transferred over 2,300 units in exchange for $2.8 billion in pretax proceeds with over 160 individual deals to 3C franchisee partners who are excited about our future. These partners are committed to providing consistently bold value and our brand strategies; are capable, able to deliver great customer experience and operational standards; and finally, have capital, both to grow new units and modernize existing assets. 
Third, we remain on track with our commitment to being more efficient, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales in 2019 and run rate net CapEx of $100 million, as I mentioned earlier. As for our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period, 2017 through 2019, we remain firmly on track. During 2018, we repurchased 28 million shares for $2.4 billion at an average price less than $85. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.2 billion through the first 2 years of this program. Additionally, we are pleased to have recently announced our quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 for 2019, representing a 17% increase. 
While on the subject of capital, we're very encouraged by the debt market support for our business model and capital structure. Despite broader market volatility during Q4, we successfully issued $1.45 billion in notes through our Taco Bell whole business securitization. As you know, the securitization market is just one of the multiple markets we access. The transaction was well received and over 2.5x oversubscribed. It was upsized and reflects some of the tightest spreads ever obtained through a whole business securitization. Proceeds were used to refinance existing securitization debt and fund a portion of our capital return. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. At the KFC Division, overall customer satisfaction scores increased by 3% during 2018. 
We have continued to invest in our franchise know-how by rolling our operations college across the globe to build capability. The taste of our food is a key differentiator for KFC, therefore, we are increasing our focus on the role of the cook and enhancing standards around the core. 
And lastly, we are continuing to make it easier for our customers to enjoy Original Recipe through the continued rollout of click-and-collect kiosks and delivery. Our goal is to have 5,000 restaurants with kiosks and over 70% of our restaurants offering delivery by 2020. Just as promising, these enhancements are occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize existing assets. 
At Pizza Hut U.S., the team and franchise partners have made improvements in 3 key areas of the customer experience: First by delivering a hot, fast and reliable pizza. We have improved our average delivery time by 3 minutes and increased customer satisfaction scores. Second, since the kickoff of Hut Rewards and updates to our mobile app in late 2017, we've been squarely in the digital game. We have over 12 million active users in the loyalty program and hope to be adding more as our off-line channel gains momentum. It's an impressive achievement considering we rolled out the program in the second half of 2017. 
Pizza Hut also announced during the fourth quarter that for first time ever, Hut Rewards members can earn points for in-store purchases. The brand truly doubled down last year with 2 points awarded for every dollar spent. 
At Taco Bell, Julie Masino is doing a fantastic job leading the U.S. division and working with our franchise partners. Their focus on excellent execution is generating operating profit growth while offering customers faster service and a better experience. 
In fact, the speed of service has improved 3 seconds at lunch and 2 seconds at dinner Q4 year-over-year, unlocking transactions and sales growth during peak service hours, which helped to drive over 4 million additional transactions during the quarter. Their results show that our franchisees have really embraced our initiative of easy, and we are excited for what 2019 holds for this cult favorite. 
Next, let's talk about Bold Restaurant Development. During 2018, we opened 3,021 gross restaurants and 1,758 on a net basis, excluding Telepizza, which I will talk about next. This is truly a step change in pace representing an approximately 50% increase in net new unit growth from 2016. This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset, which you've consistently heard us discuss, can generate improved results. There is no single driver of the increase, but rather a holistic approach toward unlocking profitable franchisee-lead development supported by improved unit-level economics. We are very proud of the teams and franchisees that are making this happen and believe that by leveraging our scale and expanding our capabilities, we can continue to improve franchisee unit economics, which we all know drive unit growth long term. 
Before we move on to Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. This landmark deal places Pizza Hut in the #1 position within the category across Latin America and Iberia in terms of unit count, confirming Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. As the deal closed in December, it had no significant impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. 
1,282 Telepizza units are now included in our new master franchise agreement with Telepizza and are included in our overall unit count and have begun paying a fee to Pizza Hut. Of these stores, we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap. 
Finally, there is an ancillary agreement for another 126 restaurants that are not included in the master franchise agreement. These non-MFA restaurants will effectively pay a small fee to Pizza Hut, but will not be included in the unit count unless and until they are converted to the Pizza Hut brand. 
Post closing, our state transformed to nearly 90% off-premise-focused assets within the Telepizza regions. We are excited for what this means for development as Telepizza has agreed to add at least 2,500 units to the alliance over the next 20 years. 
To summarize, the transformation we started in 2016 is already making Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. We achieved our goal of 98% of restaurants being owned and operated by franchisees, and they're on track to deliver our commitments for the transformation. 
With 3 category-leading brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale, expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

Yes, it think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story, so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as that's clearly the most likely outcome we see.",709,"Well, thanks, Dennis. Yes, it think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story, so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as that's clearly the most likely outcome we see. With -- embedded within that guidance as normal is tailwinds and possible headwinds. 
From a tailwind standpoint, and getting at your question about regions of growth, we're really encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread development. If you look back at years passed, a lot of our successful years in development, none of which reached the levels we reached this year, were driven by China. But this year, China has played a more smaller role in us achieving what is a record for Yum! on units. That's because around the world, we are seeing good unit-level economics, which is driving our franchisees to build more stores. We're spending more time supporting them in this effort, making sure that we're picking the right locations with more sophisticated market planning tools and that -- and being as efficient as possible with our capital spend. So we've got some great tailwinds in that the development program is becoming more widespread and cuts across really just about every market that we operate in. 
As far as possible headwinds for 2019, we have this transition of the Pizza Hut dine-in estate to more of a delivery-focused estate. And obviously, that involves closing and opening stores. And during that churn, we may see more closures perhaps than we anticipated in the short term at Pizza Hut. So that's something as a possible headwind that we'll keep our eyes on. And then, I guess, the other possible headwind, for those of you who listened to the Yum China call, is their guidance for 2019 would imply a deceleration in unit development for them, although their guidance was consistent with their guidance from last year. So another thing to just keep an eye on is the number of units coming out of Yum China. 
And then I think there's a final point on development not considered in the guidance, likely not a big issue, is what I talked about with Telepizza. There's a potential for 100 to 150 units, that's our best guess right now, to close between Telepizza and Pizza Hut where there is overlap in a particular trade area. Obviously, there's going to be a lot more work that needs to be done to dig into that to identify exactly which stores would stay open and how that all plays out. But at the same time, I also highlighted there's 126 units that are not in our unit count today because they're not in the MFA, but are Telepizza stores that have the potential of being added to our unit count. 
So those 2 things are -- potentially could roughly offset each other. They're not really considered in the guidance. But as we learn more about those stores and overlaps and additions, we'll, obviously, update you on this quarterly call. 
As far as your final question on the Telepizza transaction, and do we have more of those in the hopper. What I would say is we're really pleased with the Telepizza acquisition. The management of the Telepizza business is first class. We love having them now has a master franchisee in the Yum! world. And we think that is a template for more deals that we can do, and we know that all of our brands are out there looking for deals like that. So a lot of people that want to join the Yum! system, and we hope to take advantage of that, be selective in adding the right people, but certainly something that we hope to have more news for down the road. 
I think I would just end on the development front by saying, there's strong momentum in the business. Our tools for development are getting more and more sophisticated as we can parse data to figure out where to put stores to be the most profitable, and it's widespread momentum. And as you've seen so far, the surprises tend to be on the upside, so we're excited about development going into 2019."

The QSR industry trends just were not that strong in the third and fourth quarter, but Taco Bell was clearly a standout. Is your breakfast business performing exceptionally well?

So the success of Taco Bell has been in place for a long time. Obviously, we had an acceleration in the back half of the year. We had 6% same-store sales growth in the back half and, obviously, a 9% system sales growth is a great number to finish the year on. It's -- there's no silver bullet. That team, led by Julie Masino, is just doing a great job across the board. We are known as the value leader. We are known as the innovation leader. As David said, we're running great operations. The assets are in great shape. The franchisees like their restaurant-level margins. And so I think when you add all that up, you just get a performance, a consistent performance for the 7 years that Taco Bell has delivered and, we believe, will continue to deliver. So the brand is in great shape. Even the delivery advertising, which were launched today, I had a chance -- we were at a Taco Bell a couple of weeks ago. I've seen all the marketing around the advertising supporting the Grubhub launch. It's as good as any work I've ever seen come out of Taco Bell. So if we can accelerate our growth in delivery, I think that's all positive. So they're just doing everything right, led by a great executive team and a great president."

In this case, getting POS integration in place is really important and so, obviously, we spent a lot of time with Taco Bell and Grubhub getting the POS integration done. That's now complete, and that's obviously why we're launching it. Working on the KFC team to make sure we get that integrated first. We don't want to go out and blow out without the integration because we know that with great integration, it improves speed to service, it improves order accuracy, it does everything that the customer wants. And so you can say we've gone a little slow. I would say we've gone a little slow early in order to accelerate going forward. So I'm very excited about the launch today at Taco Bell. I'm very excited that more KFC restaurants will come onboard before the end of 2019. And all indications are, certainly in the early days, higher check, incremental transactions, all of that bodes well for both brands in the U.S."

It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, inc",2108,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and a new mindset are clearly fueling improved results. In aggregate for the year, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 5% with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth excluding Telepizza units. 
Additionally, 2018 was a year of significant milestones in Bold Restaurant Development. We now have over 48,000 restaurants in approximately 270 brand-country combinations. Together with our world-class franchisees, we opened, on average, 8 gross restaurants per day or, in other words, 1 restaurant every 3 hours. 
As for the fourth quarter, I'm thrilled to share details of such a strong finish to a solid year. Items to note include a tremendous quarter at Taco Bell, where same-store sales grew 6%; another impressive quarter at KFC, where same-store sales grew 3%; and a continued slow and steady improvement at Pizza Hut U.S. with 1% same-store sales growth. 
Now into the final year of our transformation, we continue to focus on our 4 key drivers to accelerate growth. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. He will also discuss our 2018 results, 2019 guidance and progress towards our transformation commitments. 
I'll begin with our 3 Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands. In the fourth quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. For the year, system sales grew 6% with 2% same-store sales growth and 5% net new unit growth. 
The unit growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations, delivering a record 1,134 net new units this year. This achievement in unit growth was broad-based, with particular strength in China, Russia, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. 
KFC also saw widespread contribution to its 3% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with notable strength in markets like Africa, China and Iberia. Africa continued to deliver results with 7% same-store sales growth in the quarter. This sustained momentum is the result of intense focus on value backed by the introduction of the Zinger, an international fan favorite; and premium innovation like the new Dunked burger. 
In addition, China reported 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter. This stemmed from transaction-driving promotions like the Christmas Bucket and Crazy Thursday deals. And last but not least, our Iberia market delivered 6% same-store sales growth in 2018. Campaigns based on consumer proximity using delivery aggregators and that centered on the Mega Box 5 products for EUR 5 drove the growth. Importantly, each of these markets grew same-store sales growth while accelerating net new unit development. Iberia, for example, opened 35 net new units, a 26% increase in units year-over-year. 
Now to the U.S., where we finished 2018 with our fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We started off the year with introduction (sic) [ innovation ] by continuing our Taste of the South series with Smokey Mountain BBQ. We then followed this up with the debut of our Crispy Colonel sandwich in April. 
In the fourth quarter, the team built on these platforms and debuted distinctive marketing and product innovation. First, Southern-inspired Hot Honey Chicken was offered in a tenders basket or sandwich style. Second and most notably, chicken and waffles featuring Mrs. Butterworth syrup was a huge hit. KFC's bold and cheeky marketing uniquely accentuated the delicious pairing to help KFC U.S. deliver its strongest month of same-store sales growth for the year. With continued focus on value and innovation, we're excited for what 2019 has in store for this Always Original brand. 
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division, which celebrated its 60th birthday in 2018 by reaching a milestone of over 18,000 restaurants worldwide. This was, in part, due to our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza. David will give you more details on the alliance in a few minutes. I want to note that we closed the transaction in December, and while there is no significant P&L impact on the quarter, certain Telepizza units were included in the Pizza Hut Division restaurant count. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut Division yielded system sales growth of 2%, with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 10% for the quarter or 2% excluding Telepizza units. For the year, system sales grew 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 10% net new unit growth or 2% excluding Telepizza units. 
If you joined us during our Investor and Analyst Day, we mentioned being proud of the foundational improvements we have made but dissatisfied with the current system sales growth of our Pizza Hut Division. For both the U.S. and international business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. 
International Pizza Hut system sales grew 3% in the quarter due to a 5% net new unit growth excluding Telepizza. We were pleased to see pockets of same-store sales growth progress in the fourth quarter, including in Mexico and Brazil. But overall same-store sales were flat as dine-in sales continue to weigh on overall results. 
As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call and in New York at our Investor Day, the gap between dine-in channel sales and off-premise is significant, with both the U.S. and international seeing a roughly 10-point differential. About 40% of our units outside of the U.S. are dine-in restaurants with predominantly dine-in sales, and about half of these units are in China. We are leveraging best practices from our strongest international markets to provide targeted alternative asset solutions. 
In 2018, we found success in our off-premise-focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. Combined, these modern off-premise-focused restaurants represented 90% of total net new units in 2018, with particular success in India, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. The addition of nearly 1,300 Telepizza units will accelerate the transformation of our estate to a more off-premise-focused asset base. 
In the U.S., system sales increased 1% in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. We're encouraged by the operational foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand's position. Over the year, we acquired QuikOrder, our third-party online service provider. Running our own e-commerce platform will enable us to more quickly provide breakthrough products and convenient services to our customers that will allow for better franchise economics over the long term. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. continued its emphasis on value. The $5 lineup, which features favorites like a medium 1-top pizza, Garlic Knots, wings and our new Cinnabon Mini Rolls, helped improve traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. 
Our partnership with the NFL has brought attention to these value concepts and improved the distinctiveness of our messaging. Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand, and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life. 
Now on to Taco Bell, where 2018 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, once again outpacing the industry, a remarkable feat. Fourth quarter system sales grew an impressive 9%, with system (sic) [ same-store ] sales growth of 6% and net new unit growth of 3%, a testament to the strength of their leadership team and partnership with their franchisees. 
During the quarter, we doubled down on value in the U.S., with double versions of customer favorites, including the Triple Double Crunchwrap and Double Chalupa. Then fan-favorite Rolled Chicken Tacos finished the quarter off strong. 
Taco Bell supported the quarter's value and innovation with distinctive brand moments as well, including celebrating our sixth annual Friendsgiving with an exclusive dinner at our innovation center and launching the Taco Bell Taco Shop, our online retail channel that features some fantastic holiday-themed swag that sold out in days. Both of these events generated top-tier media buzz. As we enter 2019, Taco Bell remains focused on being a Category of One for everyone. 
In addition to a relentless commitment to value and innovation for which Taco Bell is known, in 2019, Taco Bell aims to make it even easier to access for our customers. In fact, this morning, on the first anniversary of our strategic partnership with Grubhub, Taco Bell officially announced the national launch of Taco Bell delivery in over 4,000 restaurants across the U.S. Fans looking to enjoy their favorite menu items at home can jump onto tacobell.com or go directly to grubhub.com or the Grubhub app to place their order. This launch is an important milestone on our journey to make the Taco Bell brand easier to access, and I want to thank the Taco Bell system and the Grubhub team for making this a reality. 
For Taco Bell International, there was a lot to be excited about as well. We took National Taco Day to more than 25 markets to generate awareness and drive sales. We leveraged U.S. product innovation, like the Naked Chicken Taco in India and Korea and Naked Chicken Chips in the U.K. We had solid local innovation, like the Crispy Potaco in India, and we even have delivery available in 15 markets and are testing kiosks in several countries. 
Unit growth is gaining momentum, with continued profitable growth in India, Spain and new markets like Peru. In the U.K., development was also strong, including our first 3 stores in London, where we announced our reentry into the market in a way only Taco Bell can, with the help of Big Ben's chimes. 
In 2018, our franchisees committed to over 1,100 international units under development agreements, augmenting our strong pipeline for future growth. This is only the beginning for Taco Bell International, and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. 
Now on to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you all saw -- as you all recently saw, the Board of Directors and I unanimously decided to promote David Gibbs to President and Chief Operating Officer. David is a longtime Yum! veteran, and he's been instrumental in shaping our global strategy, accelerating the pace of global new unit development, executing our transformation and laying a strong foundation for future growth. In his new role, he now has direct oversight of each of the brands with the brand leaders reporting to him. I couldn't be more pleased for David to take on this role, and I look forward to his continued contribution and leadership. 
David and I, along with the Board of Directors, have taken a fresh look at our structure and long-term bench as we continue to focus on accelerating our growth. Coming out of that review, we feel great about the level of talent we have throughout the global organization and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. 
This includes the recent promotions of Tony Lowings as CEO of KFC and Vipul Chawla as President of Pizza Hut International. 
Additionally, we've made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage for Yum! by investing in select new world-class talent. First, and as we've already announced, we'll be hiring a CFO as David assumes his new duties. David will maintain his CFO responsibilities until a new CFO is in place. 
Second, with technology increasingly at the forefront of our strategic planning efforts, and given its importance to all 4 of our growth drivers, we will also be hiring a new senior leader reporting to me who is focused on global, digital and technology strategy. This new role will lead to a coordinated cross-brand global effort to better leverage technology to drive sales and better economics for our franchisees. And finally, over the coming quarters, we will also be looking to opportunistically bolster our brand leadership teams. 
In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we are doing around the world, with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum! We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformational strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capabil",1885,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
First, our 2018 results. I'm thrilled that we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, particularly reaching the high end of the original range for net new unit growth, which I'll talk about more in a few minutes. Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved throughout the year, ultimately achieving 2% and 5%, respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth ex FX was 6% at KFC and 6% at Taco Bell, both impressive accomplishments. 
As a reminder, 2 items weighed on our core operating profit results: the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising, and the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result and in line with our expectations, core operating profit growth for the full year was flat. As we anticipated, the second half of the year was better than the first: fourth quarter system sales growth of 6%, same-store sales growth of 3% and core operating profit growth of 5%, each a peak quarterly result for the year. 
Taco Bell was a major contributor to the quarterly improvement with a 9% system sales increase, driven by an impressive 6% same-store sales growth. Not to be left out, KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, ended the year on a high note with 3% same-store sales growth and 5% net unit growth, driving 7% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Before moving on, just a quick update on the impact of our Grubhub investment on EPS. Net for the full year, the mark-to-market of our Grubhub stock had a positive $0.03 impact. In the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market had a negative $0.41 impact. We're very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub in the U.S. and the national launch of delivery today with Taco Bell and later this year with KFC. We will continue to update you on the mark-to-market adjustments each quarter.  
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2019. Consistent with our communications during our Investor and Analyst Day in December, we anticipate net new unit growth of approximately 4% and same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. Our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the roll-off of special media spending in 2018 due to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, roll-off of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business. There's no change to our guidance for an estimated run rate net capital expenditures of $100 million and G&A at 1.7% of system sales in 2019. 
Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS. Since we issued this guidance in 2016, we have seen continued strong performance at both KFC and Taco Bell, though clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. Thus, we remain on track to deliver this goal, owing to the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As a reminder, the $3.75 does not include any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items we might incur nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
That said, I'd like to provide a little more color on 2 of these items. At this time, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. We also estimate the impact of FX rate movements to be a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. We plan to update you on our FX estimates quarterly. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused means we are maniacal about our 4 key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% system sales growth. Second, we are pleased to report we have reached our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised, with 856 company units as of the end of 2018. 
Putting this effort into context, from fourth quarter 2016 through 2018, we transferred over 2,300 units in exchange for $2.8 billion in pretax proceeds with over 160 individual deals to 3C franchisee partners who are excited about our future. These partners are committed to providing consistently bold value and our brand strategies; are capable, able to deliver great customer experience and operational standards; and finally, have capital, both to grow new units and modernize existing assets. 
Third, we remain on track with our commitment to being more efficient, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales in 2019 and run rate net CapEx of $100 million, as I mentioned earlier. As for our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period, 2017 through 2019, we remain firmly on track. During 2018, we repurchased 28 million shares for $2.4 billion at an average price less than $85. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.2 billion through the first 2 years of this program. Additionally, we are pleased to have recently announced our quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 for 2019, representing a 17% increase. 
While on the subject of capital, we're very encouraged by the debt market support for our business model and capital structure. Despite broader market volatility during Q4, we successfully issued $1.45 billion in notes through our Taco Bell whole business securitization. As you know, the securitization market is just one of the multiple markets we access. The transaction was well received and over 2.5x oversubscribed. It was upsized and reflects some of the tightest spreads ever obtained through a whole business securitization. Proceeds were used to refinance existing securitization debt and fund a portion of our capital return. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. At the KFC Division, overall customer satisfaction scores increased by 3% during 2018. We have continued to invest in our franchise know-how by rolling our operations college across the globe to build capability. The taste of our food is a key differentiator for KFC. Therefore, we are increasing our focus on the role of the cook and enhancing standards around the core. 
And lastly, we are continuing to make it easier for our customers to enjoy Original Recipe through the continued rollout of click-and-collect kiosks and delivery. Our goal is to have 5,000 restaurants with kiosks and over 70% of our restaurants offering delivery by 2020. Just as promising, these enhancements are occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize existing assets. 
At Pizza Hut U.S., the team and franchise partners have made improvements in 3 key areas of the customer experience: first by delivering a hot, fast and reliable pizza. We have improved our average delivery time by 3 minutes and increased customer satisfaction scores. Second, since the kickoff of Hut Rewards and updates to our mobile app in late 2017, we've been squarely in the digital game. We have over 12 million active users in the loyalty program and hope to be adding more as our off-line channel gains momentum. It's an impressive achievement considering we rolled out the program in the second half of 2017. 
Pizza Hut also announced during the fourth quarter that for the first time ever, Hut Rewards members can earn points for in-store purchases. The brand truly doubled down last year with 2 points awarded for every dollar spent. 
At Taco Bell, Julie Masino is doing a fantastic job leading the U.S. division and working with our franchise partners. Their focus on excellent execution is generating operating profit growth while offering customers faster service and a better experience. In fact, the speed of service has improved 3 seconds at lunch and 2 seconds at dinner Q4 year-over-year, unlocking transactions and sales growth during peak service hours, which helped drive over 4 million additional transactions during the quarter. Their results show that our franchisees have really embraced our initiative of easy, and we are excited for what 2019 holds for this cult favorite. 
Next, let's talk about Bold Restaurant Development. During 2018, we opened 3,021 gross restaurants and 1,758 on a net basis excluding Telepizza, which I will talk about next. This is truly a step change in pace, representing an approximately 50% increase in net new unit growth from 2016. This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset, which you've consistently heard us discuss, can generate improved results. 
There is no single driver of the increase, but rather a holistic approach toward unlocking profitable franchisee-led development, supported by improved unit-level economics. We are very proud of the teams and franchisees that are making this happen and believe that by leveraging our scale and expanding our capabilities, we can continue to improve franchisee unit economics, which we all know drives unit growth long term. 
Before we move on to Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. This landmark deal places Pizza Hut in the #1 position within the category across Latin America and Iberia in terms of unit count, confirming Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. As the deal closed in December, it had no significant impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. 
1,282 Telepizza units are now included in our new master franchise agreement with Telepizza and are included in our overall unit count and have begun paying a fee to Pizza Hut. Of these stores, we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap. 
Finally, there is an ancillary agreement for another 126 restaurants that are not included in the master; franchise agreement. These non-MFA restaurants will effectively pay a small fee to Pizza Hut, but will not be included in the unit count unless and until they are converted to the Pizza Hut brand. Post closing, our estate transformed to nearly 90% off-premise-focused assets within the Telepizza regions. We are excited for what this means for development as Telepizza has agreed to add at least 2,500 units to the alliance over the next 20 years. 
To summarize, the transformation we started in 2016 is already making Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. We achieved our goal of 98% of restaurants being owned and operated by franchisees, and they're on track to deliver our commitments for the transformation. With 3 category-leading brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale, expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

365997,573585744,1649791,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2019",2019-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Well, thanks, Dennis. Yes, I think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story, so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as that's clearly the most likely outcome we see. W",708,"Well, thanks, Dennis. Yes, I think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story, so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as that's clearly the most likely outcome we see. With -- embedded within that guidance, as normal, is tailwinds and possible headwinds. 
From a tailwind standpoint, and getting at your question about regions of growth, we're really encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread development. If you look back at years passed, a lot of our successful years on development, none of which reached the levels we reached this year, were driven by China. But this year, China has played a much smaller role in us achieving what is a record for Yum! on units. That's because, around the world, we are seeing good unit-level economics, which is driving our franchisees to build more stores. We're spending more time supporting them in this effort, making sure that we're picking the right locations with more sophisticated market planning tools and being as efficient as possible with our capital spend. So we've got some great tailwinds in that the development program is becoming more widespread and cuts across really just about every market that we operate in. 
As far as possible headwinds for 2019, we have this transition of the Pizza Hut dine-in estate to more of a delivery-focused estate. And obviously, that involves closing and opening stores. And during that churn, we may see more closures perhaps than we had anticipated in the short term at Pizza Hut. So that's something -- that's a possible headwind that we'll keep our eyes on. And then, I guess, the other possible headwind for those of you who listened to the Yum China call, is their guidance for 2019 would imply a deceleration in unit development for them, although their guidance was consistent with their guidance from last year. So another thing to just keep an eye on is the number of units coming out of Yum China. 
And then I think there's a final point on development not considered in the guidance, likely not a big issue, is what I talked about with Telepizza. There's a potential for 100 to 150 units, that's our best guess right now, to close between Telepizza and Pizza Hut where there is overlap in a particular trade area. Obviously, there's going to be a lot more work that needs to be done to dig into that to identify exactly which stores would stay open and how that all plays out. But at the same time, I also highlighted there's 126 units that are not in our unit count today because they're not in the MFA, but are Telepizza stores that have the potential of being added to our unit count. 
So those 2 things are -- potentially could roughly offset each other. They're not really considered in the guidance. But as we learn more about those stores and overlaps and additions, we'll, obviously, update you on this quarterly call. 
As far as your final question on the Telepizza transaction and do we have more of those in the hopper, what I would say is we're really pleased with the Telepizza acquisition. The management of the Telepizza business is first class. We love having them now as a master franchisee in the Yum! world. And we think that is a template for more deals that we can do, and we know that all of our brands are out there looking for deals like that. There's a lot of people that want to join the Yum! system, and we hope to take advantage of that, be selective in adding the right people, but certainly something that we hope to have more news for down the road. 
I think I would just end on the development front by saying there's strong momentum in the business. Our tools for development are getting more and more sophisticated as we can parse data to figure out where to put stores to be the most profitable, and it's widespread momentum. And as you've seen so far, the surprises tend to be on the upside, so we're excited about development going into 2019."

So the success of Taco Bell has been in place for a long time. Obviously, we had an acceleration in the back half of the year. We had 6% same-store sales growth in the back half, and obviously, a 9% system sales growth is a great number to finish the year on. It's -- there's no silver bullet. That team, led by Julie Masino, is just doing a great job across the board. We are known as the value leader. We are known as the innovation leader. As David said, we're running great operations. The assets are in great shape. The franchisees like their restaurant-level margins. And so I think when you add all that up, you just get a performance -- a consistent performance for the 7 years that Taco Bell has delivered and, we believe, will continue to deliver. 
So the brand is in great shape. Even the delivery advertising, which will launch today, I had a chance -- we were at a Taco Bell a couple of weeks ago. I've seen all the marketing around -- the advertising supporting the Grubhub launch. It's as good as any work I've ever seen come out of Taco Bell. So if we can accelerate our growth in delivery, I think that's all positive. So they're just doing everything right, led by a great executive team and a great president."

We don't want to go out and blow out without the integration because we know with great integration, it improves speed to service, it improves order accuracy, it does everything that the customer wants. And so you can say we've gone a little slow -- I would say we've gone a little slow early in order to accelerate going forward. So I'm very excited about the launch today for Taco Bell, and I'm very excited that more KFC restaurants will come onboard before the end of 2019. And all indications are, certainly in the early days, higher check, incremental transactions, all of that bodes well for both brands in the U.S."

And to your question about G&A, obviously, most master franchise agreements -- or the master franchisor, in this case, Telepizza, actually carries the G&A to manage the business. That's why we take a lower royalty. So we don't expect any increase in our G&A. In fact, it would be the opposite.

365997,573585744,1650833,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2019",2019-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, inc",2108,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and a new mindset are clearly fueling improved results. In aggregate for the year, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 5% with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth excluding Telepizza units. 
Additionally, 2018 was a year of significant milestones in Bold Restaurant Development. We now have over 48,000 restaurants in approximately 270 brand-country combinations. Together with our world-class franchisees, we opened, on average, 8 gross restaurants per day or, in other words, 1 restaurant every 3 hours. 
As for the fourth quarter, I'm thrilled to share details of such a strong finish to a solid year. Items to note include a tremendous quarter at Taco Bell, where same-store sales grew 6%; another impressive quarter at KFC, where same-store sales grew 3%; and a continued slow and steady improvement at Pizza Hut U.S. with 1% same-store sales growth. 
Now into the final year of our transformation, we continue to focus on our 4 key drivers to accelerate growth. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. He will also discuss our 2018 results, 2019 guidance and progress towards our transformation commitments. 
I'll begin with our 3 Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands. In the fourth quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. For the year, system sales grew 6% with 2% same-store sales growth and 5% net new unit growth. 
The unit growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations, delivering a record 1,134 net new units this year. This achievement in unit growth was broad-based, with particular strength in China, Russia, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. 
KFC also saw widespread contribution to its 3% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with notable strength in markets like Africa, China and Iberia. Africa continued to deliver results with 7% same-store sales growth in the quarter. This sustained momentum is the result of intense focus on value backed by the introduction of the Zinger, an international fan favorite; and premium innovation like the new Dunked burger. 
In addition, China reported 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter. This stemmed from transaction-driving promotions like the Christmas Bucket and Crazy Thursday deals. And last but not least, our Iberia market delivered 6% same-store sales growth in 2018. Campaigns based on consumer proximity using delivery aggregators and that centered on the Mega Box 5 products for EUR 5 drove the growth. Importantly, each of these markets grew same-store sales growth while accelerating net new unit development. Iberia, for example, opened 35 net new units, a 26% increase in units year-over-year. 
Now to the U.S., where we finished 2018 with our fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We started off the year with introduction (sic) [ innovation ] by continuing our Taste of the South series with Smokey Mountain BBQ. We then followed this up with the debut of our Crispy Colonel sandwich in April. 
In the fourth quarter, the team built on these platforms and debuted distinctive marketing and product innovation. First, Southern-inspired Hot Honey Chicken was offered in a tenders basket or sandwich style. Second and most notably, chicken and waffles featuring Mrs. Butterworth syrup was a huge hit. KFC's bold and cheeky marketing uniquely accentuated the delicious pairing to help KFC U.S. deliver its strongest month of same-store sales growth for the year. With continued focus on value and innovation, we're excited for what 2019 has in store for this Always Original brand. 
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division, which celebrated its 60th birthday in 2018 by reaching a milestone of over 18,000 restaurants worldwide. This was, in part, due to our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza. David will give you more details on the alliance in a few minutes. I want to note that we closed the transaction in December, and while there is no significant P&L impact on the quarter, certain Telepizza units were included in the Pizza Hut Division restaurant count. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut Division yielded system sales growth of 2%, with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 10% for the quarter or 2% excluding Telepizza units. For the year, system sales grew 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 10% net new unit growth or 2% excluding Telepizza units. 
If you joined us during our Investor and Analyst Day, we mentioned being proud of the foundational improvements we have made but dissatisfied with the current system sales growth of our Pizza Hut Division. For both the U.S. and international business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. 
International Pizza Hut system sales grew 3% in the quarter due to a 5% net new unit growth excluding Telepizza. We were pleased to see pockets of same-store sales growth progress in the fourth quarter, including in Mexico and Brazil. But overall same-store sales were flat as dine-in sales continue to weigh on overall results. 
As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call and in New York at our Investor Day, the gap between dine-in channel sales and off-premise is significant, with both the U.S. and international seeing a roughly 10-point differential. About 40% of our units outside of the U.S. are dine-in restaurants with predominantly dine-in sales, and about half of these units are in China. We are leveraging best practices from our strongest international markets to provide targeted alternative asset solutions. 
In 2018, we found success in our off-premise-focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. Combined, these modern off-premise-focused restaurants represented 90% of total net new units in 2018, with particular success in India, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. The addition of nearly 1,300 Telepizza units will accelerate the transformation of our estate to a more off-premise-focused asset base. 
In the U.S., system sales increased 1% in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. We're encouraged by the operational foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand's position. Over the year, we acquired QuikOrder, our third-party online service provider. Running our own e-commerce platform will enable us to more quickly provide breakthrough products and convenient services to our customers that will allow for better franchise economics over the long term. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. continued its emphasis on value. The $5 lineup, which features favorites like a medium 1-top pizza, Garlic Knots, wings and our new Cinnabon Mini Rolls, helped improve traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. 
Our partnership with the NFL has brought attention to these value concepts and improved the distinctiveness of our messaging. Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand, and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life. 
Now on to Taco Bell, where 2018 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, once again outpacing the industry, a remarkable feat. Fourth quarter system sales grew an impressive 9%, with system (sic) [ same-store ] sales growth of 6% and net new unit growth of 3%, a testament to the strength of their leadership team and partnership with their franchisees. 
During the quarter, we doubled down on value in the U.S., with double versions of customer favorites, including the Triple Double Crunchwrap and Double Chalupa. Then fan-favorite Rolled Chicken Tacos finished the quarter off strong. 
Taco Bell supported the quarter's value and innovation with distinctive brand moments as well, including celebrating our sixth annual Friendsgiving with an exclusive dinner at our innovation center and launching the Taco Bell Taco Shop, our online retail channel that features some fantastic holiday-themed swag that sold out in days. Both of these events generated top-tier media buzz. As we enter 2019, Taco Bell remains focused on being a Category of One for everyone. 
In addition to a relentless commitment to value and innovation for which Taco Bell is known, in 2019, Taco Bell aims to make it even easier to access for our customers. In fact, this morning, on the first anniversary of our strategic partnership with Grubhub, Taco Bell officially announced the national launch of Taco Bell delivery in over 4,000 restaurants across the U.S. Fans looking to enjoy their favorite menu items at home can jump onto tacobell.com or go directly to grubhub.com or the Grubhub app to place their order. This launch is an important milestone on our journey to make the Taco Bell brand easier to access, and I want to thank the Taco Bell system and the Grubhub team for making this a reality. 
For Taco Bell International, there was a lot to be excited about as well. We took National Taco Day to more than 25 markets to generate awareness and drive sales. We leveraged U.S. product innovation, like the Naked Chicken Taco in India and Korea and Naked Chicken Chips in the U.K. We had solid local innovation, like the Crispy Potaco in India, and we even have delivery available in 15 markets and are testing kiosks in several countries. 
Unit growth is gaining momentum, with continued profitable growth in India, Spain and new markets like Peru. In the U.K., development was also strong, including our first 3 stores in London, where we announced our reentry into the market in a way only Taco Bell can, with the help of Big Ben's chimes. 
In 2018, our franchisees committed to over 1,100 international units under development agreements, augmenting our strong pipeline for future growth. This is only the beginning for Taco Bell International, and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. 
Now on to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you all saw -- as you all recently saw, the Board of Directors and I unanimously decided to promote David Gibbs to President and Chief Operating Officer. David is a longtime Yum! veteran, and he's been instrumental in shaping our global strategy, accelerating the pace of global new unit development, executing our transformation and laying a strong foundation for future growth. In his new role, he now has direct oversight of each of the brands with the brand leaders reporting to him. I couldn't be more pleased for David to take on this role, and I look forward to his continued contribution and leadership. 
David and I, along with the Board of Directors, have taken a fresh look at our structure and long-term bench as we continue to focus on accelerating our growth. Coming out of that review, we feel great about the level of talent we have throughout the global organization and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. 
This includes the recent promotions of Tony Lowings as CEO of KFC and Vipul Chawla as President of Pizza Hut International. 
Additionally, we've made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage for Yum! by investing in select new world-class talent. First, and as we've already announced, we'll be hiring a CFO as David assumes his new duties. David will maintain his CFO responsibilities until a new CFO is in place. 
Second, with technology increasingly at the forefront of our strategic planning efforts, and given its importance to all 4 of our growth drivers, we will also be hiring a new senior leader reporting to me who is focused on global, digital and technology strategy. This new role will lead to a coordinated cross-brand global effort to better leverage technology to drive sales and better economics for our franchisees. And finally, over the coming quarters, we will also be looking to opportunistically bolster our brand leadership teams. 
In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we are doing around the world, with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum! We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformational strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,573585744,1650833,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2019",2019-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capabil",1885,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
First, our 2018 results. I'm thrilled that we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, particularly reaching the high end of the original range for net new unit growth, which I'll talk about more in a few minutes. Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved throughout the year, ultimately achieving 2% and 5%, respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth ex FX was 6% at KFC and 6% at Taco Bell, both impressive accomplishments. 
As a reminder, 2 items weighed on our core operating profit results: the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising, and the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result and in line with our expectations, core operating profit growth for the full year was flat. As we anticipated, the second half of the year was better than the first: fourth quarter system sales growth of 6%, same-store sales growth of 3% and core operating profit growth of 5%, each a peak quarterly result for the year. 
Taco Bell was a major contributor to the quarterly improvement with a 9% system sales increase, driven by an impressive 6% same-store sales growth. Not to be left out, KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, ended the year on a high note with 3% same-store sales growth and 5% net unit growth, driving 7% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Before moving on, just a quick update on the impact of our Grubhub investment on EPS. Net for the full year, the mark-to-market of our Grubhub stock had a positive $0.03 impact. In the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market had a negative $0.41 impact. We're very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub in the U.S. and the national launch of delivery today with Taco Bell and later this year with KFC. We will continue to update you on the mark-to-market adjustments each quarter.  
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2019. Consistent with our communications during our Investor and Analyst Day in December, we anticipate net new unit growth of approximately 4% and same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. Our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the roll-off of special media spending in 2018 due to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, roll-off of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business. There's no change to our guidance for an estimated run rate net capital expenditures of $100 million and G&A at 1.7% of system sales in 2019. 
Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS. Since we issued this guidance in 2016, we have seen continued strong performance at both KFC and Taco Bell, though clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. Thus, we remain on track to deliver this goal, owing to the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As a reminder, the $3.75 does not include any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items we might incur nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
That said, I'd like to provide a little more color on 2 of these items. At this time, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. We also estimate the impact of FX rate movements to be a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. We plan to update you on our FX estimates quarterly. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused means we are maniacal about our 4 key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% system sales growth. Second, we are pleased to report we have reached our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised, with 856 company units as of the end of 2018. 
Putting this effort into context, from fourth quarter 2016 through 2018, we transferred over 2,300 units in exchange for $2.8 billion in pretax proceeds with over 160 individual deals to 3C franchisee partners who are excited about our future. These partners are committed to providing consistently bold value and our brand strategies; are capable, able to deliver great customer experience and operational standards; and finally, have capital, both to grow new units and modernize existing assets. 
Third, we remain on track with our commitment to being more efficient, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales in 2019 and run rate net CapEx of $100 million, as I mentioned earlier. As for our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period, 2017 through 2019, we remain firmly on track. During 2018, we repurchased 28 million shares for $2.4 billion at an average price less than $85. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.2 billion through the first 2 years of this program. Additionally, we are pleased to have recently announced our quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 for 2019, representing a 17% increase. 
While on the subject of capital, we're very encouraged by the debt market support for our business model and capital structure. Despite broader market volatility during Q4, we successfully issued $1.45 billion in notes through our Taco Bell whole business securitization. As you know, the securitization market is just one of the multiple markets we access. The transaction was well received and over 2.5x oversubscribed. It was upsized and reflects some of the tightest spreads ever obtained through a whole business securitization. Proceeds were used to refinance existing securitization debt and fund a portion of our capital return. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. At the KFC Division, overall customer satisfaction scores increased by 3% during 2018. We have continued to invest in our franchise know-how by rolling our operations college across the globe to build capability. The taste of our food is a key differentiator for KFC. Therefore, we are increasing our focus on the role of the cook and enhancing standards around the core. 
And lastly, we are continuing to make it easier for our customers to enjoy Original Recipe through the continued rollout of click-and-collect kiosks and delivery. Our goal is to have 5,000 restaurants with kiosks and over 70% of our restaurants offering delivery by 2020. Just as promising, these enhancements are occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize existing assets. 
At Pizza Hut U.S., the team and franchise partners have made improvements in 3 key areas of the customer experience: first by delivering a hot, fast and reliable pizza. We have improved our average delivery time by 3 minutes and increased customer satisfaction scores. Second, since the kickoff of Hut Rewards and updates to our mobile app in late 2017, we've been squarely in the digital game. We have over 12 million active users in the loyalty program and hope to be adding more as our off-line channel gains momentum. It's an impressive achievement considering we rolled out the program in the second half of 2017. 
Pizza Hut also announced during the fourth quarter that for the first time ever, Hut Rewards members can earn points for in-store purchases. The brand truly doubled down last year with 2 points awarded for every dollar spent. 
At Taco Bell, Julie Masino is doing a fantastic job leading the U.S. division and working with our franchise partners. Their focus on excellent execution is generating operating profit growth while offering customers faster service and a better experience. In fact, the speed of service has improved 3 seconds at lunch and 2 seconds at dinner Q4 year-over-year, unlocking transactions and sales growth during peak service hours, which helped drive over 4 million additional transactions during the quarter. Their results show that our franchisees have really embraced our initiative of easy, and we are excited for what 2019 holds for this cult favorite. 
Next, let's talk about Bold Restaurant Development. During 2018, we opened 3,021 gross restaurants and 1,758 on a net basis excluding Telepizza, which I will talk about next. This is truly a step change in pace, representing an approximately 50% increase in net new unit growth from 2016. This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset, which you've consistently heard us discuss, can generate improved results. 
There is no single driver of the increase, but rather a holistic approach toward unlocking profitable franchisee-led development, supported by improved unit-level economics. We are very proud of the teams and franchisees that are making this happen and believe that by leveraging our scale and expanding our capabilities, we can continue to improve franchisee unit economics, which we all know drives unit growth long term. 
Before we move on to Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. This landmark deal places Pizza Hut in the #1 position within the category across Latin America and Iberia in terms of unit count, confirming Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. As the deal closed in December, it had no significant impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. 
1,282 Telepizza units are now included in our new master franchise agreement with Telepizza and are included in our overall unit count and have begun paying a fee to Pizza Hut. Of these stores, we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap. 
Finally, there is an ancillary agreement for another 126 restaurants that are not included in the master; franchise agreement. These non-MFA restaurants will effectively pay a small fee to Pizza Hut, but will not be included in the unit count unless and until they are converted to the Pizza Hut brand. Post closing, our estate transformed to nearly 90% off-premise-focused assets within the Telepizza regions. We are excited for what this means for development as Telepizza has agreed to add at least 2,500 units to the alliance over the next 20 years. 
To summarize, the transformation we started in 2016 is already making Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. We achieved our goal of 98% of restaurants being owned and operated by franchisees, and they're on track to deliver our commitments for the transformation. With 3 category-leading brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale, expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

Yes, I think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story, so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as that's clearly the most likely outcome we see. W",708,"Well, thanks, Dennis. Yes, I think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story, so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as that's clearly the most likely outcome we see. With -- embedded within that guidance, as normal, is tailwinds and possible headwinds. 
From a tailwind standpoint, and getting at your question about regions of growth, we're really encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread development. If you look back at years passed, a lot of our successful years on development, none of which reached the levels we reached this year, were driven by China. But this year, China has played a much smaller role in us achieving what is a record for Yum! on units. That's because, around the world, we are seeing good unit-level economics, which is driving our franchisees to build more stores. We're spending more time supporting them in this effort, making sure that we're picking the right locations with more sophisticated market planning tools and being as efficient as possible with our capital spend. So we've got some great tailwinds in that the development program is becoming more widespread and cuts across really just about every market that we operate in. 
As far as possible headwinds for 2019, we have this transition of the Pizza Hut dine-in estate to more of a delivery-focused estate. And obviously, that involves closing and opening stores. And during that churn, we may see more closures perhaps than we had anticipated in the short term at Pizza Hut. So that's something -- that's a possible headwind that we'll keep our eyes on. And then, I guess, the other possible headwind for those of you who listened to the Yum China call, is their guidance for 2019 would imply a deceleration in unit development for them, although their guidance was consistent with their guidance from last year. So another thing to just keep an eye on is the number of units coming out of Yum China. 
And then I think there's a final point on development not considered in the guidance, likely not a big issue, is what I talked about with Telepizza. There's a potential for 100 to 150 units, that's our best guess right now, to close between Telepizza and Pizza Hut where there is overlap in a particular trade area. Obviously, there's going to be a lot more work that needs to be done to dig into that to identify exactly which stores would stay open and how that all plays out. But at the same time, I also highlighted there's 126 units that are not in our unit count today because they're not in the MFA, but are Telepizza stores that have the potential of being added to our unit count. 
So those 2 things are -- potentially could roughly offset each other. They're not really considered in the guidance. But as we learn more about those stores and overlaps and additions, we'll, obviously, update you on this quarterly call. 
As far as your final question on the Telepizza transaction and do we have more of those in the hopper, what I would say is we're really pleased with the Telepizza acquisition. The management of the Telepizza business is first class. We love having them now as a master franchisee in the Yum! world. And we think that is a template for more deals that we can do, and we know that all of our brands are out there looking for deals like that. There's a lot of people that want to join the Yum! system, and we hope to take advantage of that, be selective in adding the right people, but certainly something that we hope to have more news for down the road. 
I think I would just end on the development front by saying there's strong momentum in the business. Our tools for development are getting more and more sophisticated as we can parse data to figure out where to put stores to be the most profitable, and it's widespread momentum. And as you've seen so far, the surprises tend to be on the upside, so we're excited about development going into 2019."

The assets are in great shape. The franchisees like their restaurant-level margins. And so I think when you add all that up, you just get a performance -- a consistent performance for the 7 years that Taco Bell has delivered and, we believe, will continue to deliver. 
So the brand is in great shape. Even the delivery advertising, which will launch today, I had a chance -- we were at a Taco Bell a couple of weeks ago. I've seen all the marketing around -- the advertising supporting the Grubhub launch. It's as good as any work I've ever seen come out of Taco Bell. So if we can accelerate our growth in delivery, I think that's all positive. So they're just doing everything right, led by a great executive team and a great president."

In this case, getting POS integration in place is really important, and so obviously, we spent a lot of time with Taco Bell and Grubhub getting the POS integration done. That's now complete, and that's obviously why we're launching it. Working on the KFC team to make sure we get that integrated first. We don't want to go out and blow out without the integration because we know with great integration, it improves speed to service, it improves order accuracy, it does everything that the customer wants. And so you can say we've gone a little slow -- I would say we've gone a little slow early in order to accelerate going forward. So I'm very excited about the launch today for Taco Bell, and I'm very excited that more KFC restaurants will come onboard before the end of 2019. And all indications are, certainly in the early days, higher check, incremental transactions, all of that bodes well for both brands in the U.S."

And to your question about G&A, obviously, most master franchise agreements -- or the master franchisor, in this case, Telepizza, actually carries the G&A to manage the business.

It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, inc",2108,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. It's been a little over 2 years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and a new mindset are clearly fueling improved results. In aggregate for the year, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 5% with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth excluding Telepizza units. 
Additionally, 2018 was a year of significant milestones in Bold Restaurant Development. We now have over 48,000 restaurants in approximately 270 brand-country combinations. Together with our world-class franchisees, we opened, on average, 8 gross restaurants per day or, in other words, 1 restaurant every 3 hours. 
As for the fourth quarter, I'm thrilled to share details of such a strong finish to a solid year. Items to note include a tremendous quarter at Taco Bell, where same-store sales grew 6%; another impressive quarter at KFC, where same-store sales grew 3%; and a continued slow and steady improvement at Pizza Hut U.S. with 1% same-store sales growth. 
Now into the final year of our transformation, we continue to focus on our 4 key drivers to accelerate growth. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. He will also discuss our 2018 results, 2019 guidance and progress towards our transformation commitments. 
I'll begin with our 3 Distinctive, Relevant & Easy Brands. In the fourth quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. For the year, system sales grew 6% with 2% same-store sales growth and 5% net new unit growth. 
The unit growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations, delivering a record 1,134 net new units this year. This achievement in unit growth was broad-based, with particular strength in China, Russia, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. 
KFC also saw widespread contribution to its 3% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with notable strength in markets like Africa, China and Iberia. Africa continued to deliver results with 7% same-store sales growth in the quarter. This sustained momentum is the result of intense focus on value backed by the introduction of the Zinger, an international fan favorite; and premium innovation like the new Dunked burger. 
In addition, China reported 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter. This stemmed from transaction-driving promotions like the Christmas Bucket and Crazy Thursday deals. And last but not least, our Iberia market delivered 6% same-store sales growth in 2018. Campaigns based on consumer proximity using delivery aggregators and that centered on the Mega Box 5 products for EUR 5 drove the growth. Importantly, each of these markets grew same-store sales growth while accelerating net new unit development. Iberia, for example, opened 35 net new units, a 26% increase in units year-over-year. 
Now to the U.S., where we finished 2018 with our fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We started off the year with introduction (sic) [ innovation ] by continuing our Taste of the South series with Smokey Mountain BBQ. We then followed this up with the debut of our Crispy Colonel sandwich in April. 
In the fourth quarter, the team built on these platforms and debuted distinctive marketing and product innovation. First, Southern-inspired Hot Honey Chicken was offered in a tenders basket or sandwich style. Second and most notably, chicken and waffles featuring Mrs. Butterworth syrup was a huge hit. KFC's bold and cheeky marketing uniquely accentuated the delicious pairing to help KFC U.S. deliver its strongest month of same-store sales growth for the year. With continued focus on value and innovation, we're excited for what 2019 has in store for this Always Original brand. 
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division, which celebrated its 60th birthday in 2018 by reaching a milestone of over 18,000 restaurants worldwide. This was, in part, due to our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza. David will give you more details on the alliance in a few minutes. I want to note that we closed the transaction in December, and while there is no significant P&L impact on the quarter, certain Telepizza units were included in the Pizza Hut Division restaurant count. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut Division yielded system sales growth of 2%, with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 10% for the quarter or 2% excluding Telepizza units. For the year, system sales grew 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 10% net new unit growth or 2% excluding Telepizza units. 
If you joined us during our Investor and Analyst Day, we mentioned being proud of the foundational improvements we have made but dissatisfied with the current system sales growth of our Pizza Hut Division. For both the U.S. and international business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. 
International Pizza Hut system sales grew 3% in the quarter due to a 5% net new unit growth excluding Telepizza. We were pleased to see pockets of same-store sales growth progress in the fourth quarter, including in Mexico and Brazil. But overall same-store sales were flat as dine-in sales continue to weigh on overall results. 
As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call and in New York at our Investor Day, the gap between dine-in channel sales and off-premise is significant, with both the U.S. and international seeing a roughly 10-point differential. About 40% of our units outside of the U.S. are dine-in restaurants with predominantly dine-in sales, and about half of these units are in China. We are leveraging best practices from our strongest international markets to provide targeted alternative asset solutions. 
In 2018, we found success in our off-premise-focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. Combined, these modern off-premise-focused restaurants represented 90% of total net new units in 2018, with particular success in India, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. The addition of nearly 1,300 Telepizza units will accelerate the transformation of our estate to a more off-premise-focused asset base. 
In the U.S., system sales increased 1% in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. We're encouraged by the operational foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand's position. Over the year, we acquired QuikOrder, our third-party online service provider. Running our own e-commerce platform will enable us to more quickly provide breakthrough products and convenient services to our customers that will allow for better franchise economics over the long term. 
In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. continued its emphasis on value. The $5 lineup, which features favorites like a medium 1-topping pizza, Garlic Knots, wings and our new Cinnabon Mini Rolls, helped improve traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. 
Our partnership with the NFL has brought attention to these value concepts and improved the distinctiveness of our messaging. Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand, and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life. 
Now on to Taco Bell, where 2018 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, once again outpacing the industry, a remarkable feat. Fourth quarter system sales grew an impressive 9%, with system (sic) [ same-store ] sales growth of 6% and net new unit growth of 3%, a testament to the strength of their leadership team and partnership with their franchisees. 
During the quarter, we doubled down on value in the U.S., with double versions of customer favorites, including the Triple Double Crunchwrap and Double Chalupa. Then fan-favorite Rolled Chicken Tacos finished the quarter off strong. 
Taco Bell supported the quarter's value and innovation with distinctive brand moments as well, including celebrating our sixth annual Friendsgiving with an exclusive dinner at our innovation center and launching the Taco Bell Taco Shop, our online retail channel that features some fantastic holiday-themed swag that sold out in days. Both of these events generated top-tier media buzz. As we enter 2019, Taco Bell remains focused on being a Category of One for everyone. 
In addition to a relentless commitment to value and innovation for which Taco Bell is known, in 2019, Taco Bell aims to make it even easier to access for our customers. In fact, this morning, on the first anniversary of our strategic partnership with Grubhub, Taco Bell officially announced the national launch of Taco Bell delivery in over 4,000 restaurants across the U.S. Fans looking to enjoy their favorite menu items at home can jump onto tacobell.com or go directly to grubhub.com or the Grubhub app to place their order. This launch is an important milestone on our journey to make the Taco Bell brand easier to access, and I want to thank the Taco Bell system and the Grubhub team for making this a reality. 
For Taco Bell International, there was a lot to be excited about as well. We took National Taco Day to more than 25 markets to generate awareness and drive sales. We leveraged U.S. product innovation, like the Naked Chicken Taco in India and Korea and Naked Chicken Chips in the U.K. We had solid local innovation, like the Crispy Potaco in India, and we even have delivery available in 15 markets and are testing kiosks in several countries. 
Unit growth is gaining momentum, with continued profitable growth in India, Spain and new markets like Peru. In the U.K., development was also strong, including our first 3 stores in London, where we announced our reentry into the market in a way only Taco Bell can, with the help of Big Ben's chimes. 
In 2018, our franchisees committed to over 1,100 international units under development agreements, augmenting our strong pipeline for future growth. This is only the beginning for Taco Bell International, and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. 
Now on to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you all saw -- as you all recently saw, the Board of Directors and I unanimously decided to promote David Gibbs to President and Chief Operating Officer. David is a longtime Yum! veteran, and he's been instrumental in shaping our global strategy, accelerating the pace of global new unit development, executing our transformation and laying a strong foundation for future growth. In his new role, he now has direct oversight of each of the brands with the brand leaders reporting to him. I couldn't be more pleased for David to take on this role, and I look forward to his continued contribution and leadership. 
David and I, along with the Board of Directors, have taken a fresh look at our structure and long-term bench as we continue to focus on accelerating our growth. Coming out of that review, we feel great about the level of talent we have throughout the global organization and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. 
This includes the recent promotions of Tony Lowings as CEO of KFC and Vipul Chawla as President of Pizza Hut International. 
Additionally, we've made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage for Yum! by investing in select new world-class talent. First, and as we've already announced, we'll be hiring a CFO as David assumes his new duties. David will maintain his CFO responsibilities until a new CFO is in place. 
Second, with technology increasingly at the forefront of our strategic planning efforts, and given its importance to all 4 of our growth drivers, we will also be hiring a new senior leader reporting to me who is focused on global, digital and technology strategy. This new role will lead to a coordinated cross-brand global effort to better leverage technology to drive sales and better economics for our franchisees. And finally, over the coming quarters, we will also be looking to opportunistically bolster our brand leadership teams. 
In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we are doing around the world, with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum! We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformational strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capabil",1885,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers: Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
First, our 2018 results. I'm thrilled that we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, particularly reaching the high end of the original range for net new unit growth, which I'll talk about more in a few minutes. Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved throughout the year, ultimately achieving 2% and 5%, respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth ex FX was 6% at KFC and 6% at Taco Bell, both impressive accomplishments. 
As a reminder, 2 items weighed on our core operating profit results: the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising, and the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result and in line with our expectations, core operating profit growth for the full year was flat. As we anticipated, the second half of the year was better than the first: fourth quarter system sales growth of 6%, same-store sales growth of 3% and core operating profit growth of 5%, each a peak quarterly result for the year. 
Taco Bell was a major contributor to the quarterly improvement with a 9% system sales increase, driven by an impressive 6% same-store sales growth. Not to be left out, KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, ended the year on a high note with 3% same-store sales growth and 5% net unit growth, driving 7% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Before moving on, just a quick update on the impact of our Grubhub investment on EPS. Net for the full year, the mark-to-market of our Grubhub stock had a positive $0.03 impact. In the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market had a negative $0.41 impact. We're very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub in the U.S. and the national launch of delivery today with Taco Bell and later this year with KFC. We will continue to update you on the mark-to-market adjustments each quarter.  
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2019. Consistent with our communications during our Investor and Analyst Day in December, we anticipate net new unit growth of approximately 4% and same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. Our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the roll-off of special media spending in 2018 due to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, roll-off of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business. There's no change to our guidance for an estimated run rate net capital expenditures of $100 million and G&A at 1.7% of system sales in 2019. 
Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS. Since we issued this guidance in 2016, we have seen continued strong performance at both KFC and Taco Bell, though clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. Thus, we remain on track to deliver this goal, owing to the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As a reminder, the $3.75 does not include any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items we might incur nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
That said, I'd like to provide a little more color on 2 of these items. At this time, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. We also estimate the impact of FX rate movements to be a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. We plan to update you on our FX estimates quarterly. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused means we are maniacal about our 4 key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% system sales growth. Second, we are pleased to report we have reached our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised, with 856 company units as of the end of 2018. 
Putting this effort into context, from fourth quarter 2016 through 2018, we transferred over 2,300 units in exchange for $2.8 billion in pretax proceeds with over 160 individual deals to 3C franchisee partners who are excited about our future. These partners are committed to providing consistently bold value and our brand strategies; are capable, able to deliver great customer experience and operational standards; and finally, have capital, both to grow new units and modernize existing assets. 
Third, we remain on track with our commitment to being more efficient, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales in 2019 and run rate net CapEx of $100 million, as I mentioned earlier. As for our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period, 2017 through 2019, we remain firmly on track. During 2018, we repurchased 28 million shares for $2.4 billion at an average price less than $85. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.2 billion through the first 2 years of this program. Additionally, we are pleased to have recently announced our quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 for 2019, representing a 17% increase. 
While on the subject of capital, we're very encouraged by the debt market support for our business model and capital structure. Despite broader market volatility during Q4, we successfully issued $1.45 billion in notes through our Taco Bell whole business securitization. As you know, the securitization market is just one of the multiple markets we access. The transaction was well received and over 2.5x oversubscribed. It was upsized and reflects some of the tightest spreads ever obtained through a whole business securitization. Proceeds were used to refinance existing securitization debt and fund a portion of our capital return. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. At the KFC Division, overall customer satisfaction scores increased by 3% during 2018. We have continued to invest in our franchise know-how by rolling our operations college across the globe to build capability. The taste of our food is a key differentiator for KFC. Therefore, we are increasing our focus on the role of the cook and enhancing standards around the core. 
And lastly, we are continuing to make it easier for our customers to enjoy Original Recipe through the continued rollout of click-and-collect kiosks and delivery. Our goal is to have 5,000 restaurants with kiosks and over 70% of our restaurants offering delivery by 2020. Just as promising, these enhancements are occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize existing assets. 
At Pizza Hut U.S., the team and franchise partners have made improvements in 3 key areas of the customer experience: first by delivering a hot, fast and reliable pizza. We have improved our average delivery time by 3 minutes and increased customer satisfaction scores. Second, since the kickoff of Hut Rewards and updates to our mobile app in late 2017, we've been squarely in the digital game. We have over 12 million active users in the loyalty program and hope to be adding more as our off-line channel gains momentum. It's an impressive achievement considering we rolled out the program in the second half of 2017. 
Pizza Hut also announced during the fourth quarter that for the first time ever, Hut Rewards members can earn points for in-store purchases. The brand truly doubled down last year with 2 points awarded for every dollar spent. 
At Taco Bell, Julie Masino is doing a fantastic job leading the U.S. division and working with our franchise partners. Their focus on excellent execution is generating operating profit growth while offering customers faster service and a better experience. In fact, the speed of service has improved 3 seconds at lunch and 2 seconds at dinner Q4 year-over-year, unlocking transactions and sales growth during peak service hours, which helped drive over 4 million additional transactions during the quarter. Their results show that our franchisees have really embraced our initiative of easy, and we are excited for what 2019 holds for this cult favorite. 
Next, let's talk about Bold Restaurant Development. During 2018, we opened 3,021 gross restaurants and 1,758 on a net basis excluding Telepizza, which I will talk about next. This is truly a step change in pace, representing an approximately 50% increase in net new unit growth from 2016. This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset, which you've consistently heard us discuss, can generate improved results. 
There is no single driver of the increase, but rather a holistic approach toward unlocking profitable franchisee-led development, supported by improved unit-level economics. We are very proud of the teams and franchisees that are making this happen and believe that by leveraging our scale and expanding our capabilities, we can continue to improve franchisee unit economics, which we all know drives unit growth long term. 
Before we move on to Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. This landmark deal places Pizza Hut in the #1 position within the category across Latin America and Iberia in terms of unit count, confirming Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. As the deal closed in December, it had no significant impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. 
1,282 Telepizza units are now included in our new master franchise agreement with Telepizza and are included in our overall unit count and have begun paying a fee to Pizza Hut. Of these stores, we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap. 
Finally, there is an ancillary agreement for another 126 restaurants that are not included in the master; franchise agreement. These non-MFA restaurants will effectively pay a small fee to Pizza Hut, but will not be included in the unit count unless and until they are converted to the Pizza Hut brand. Post closing, our estate transformed to nearly 90% off-premise-focused assets within the Telepizza regions. We are excited for what this means for development as Telepizza has agreed to add at least 2,500 units to the alliance over the next 20 years. 
To summarize, the transformation we started in 2016 is already making Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. We achieved our goal of 98% of restaurants being owned and operated by franchisees, and they're on track to deliver our commitments for the transformation. With 3 category-leading brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale, expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

365997,573585744,1651486,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2019",2019-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Well, thanks, Dennis. Yes, I think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story, so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as that's clearly the most likely outcome we see. E",706,"Well, thanks, Dennis. Yes, I think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story, so let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4%, as that's clearly the most likely outcome we see. Embedded within that guidance, as normal, is tailwinds and possible headwinds. 
From a tailwind standpoint, and getting at your question about regions of growth, we're really encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread development. If you look back at years passed, a lot of our successful years on development, none of which reached the levels we reached this year, were driven by China. But this year, China has played a much smaller role in us achieving what is a record for Yum! on units. That's because, around the world, we are seeing good unit-level economics, which is driving our franchisees to build more stores. We're spending more time supporting them in this effort, making sure that we're picking the right locations with more sophisticated market planning tools and being as efficient as possible with our capital spend. So we've got some great tailwinds in that the development program is becoming more widespread and cuts across really just about every market that we operate in. 
As far as possible headwinds for 2019, we have this transition of the Pizza Hut dine-in estate to more of a delivery-focused estate. And obviously, that involves closing and opening stores. And during that churn, we may see more closures perhaps than we had anticipated in the short term at Pizza Hut. So that's something -- that's a possible headwind that we'll keep our eyes on. And then, I guess, the other possible headwind for those of you who listened to the Yum China call, is their guidance for 2019 would imply a deceleration in unit development for them, although their guidance was consistent with their guidance from last year. So another thing to just keep an eye on is the number of units coming out of Yum China. 
And then I think there's a final point on development not considered in the guidance, likely not a big issue, is what I talked about with Telepizza. There's a potential for 100 to 150 units, that's our best guess right now, to close between Telepizza and Pizza Hut where there is overlap in a particular trade area. Obviously, there's going to be a lot more work that needs to be done to dig into that to identify exactly which stores would stay open and how that all plays out. But at the same time, I also highlighted there's 126 units that are not in our unit count today because they're not in the MFA, but are Telepizza stores that have the potential of being added to our unit count. 
So those 2 things are -- potentially could roughly offset each other. They're not really considered in the guidance. But as we learn more about those stores and overlaps and additions, we'll, obviously, update you on this quarterly call. 
As far as your final question on the Telepizza transaction and do we have more of those in the hopper, what I would say is we're really pleased with the Telepizza acquisition. The management of the Telepizza business is first class. We love having them now as a master franchisee in the Yum! world. And we think that is a template for more deals that we can do, and we know that all of our brands are out there looking for deals like that. There's a lot of people that want to join the Yum! system, and we hope to take advantage of that, be selective in adding the right people, but certainly something that we hope to have more news for down the road. 
I think I would just end on the development front by saying there's strong momentum in the business. Our tools for development are getting more and more sophisticated as we can parse data to figure out where to put stores to be the most profitable, and it's widespread momentum. And as you've seen so far, the surprises tend to be on the upside, so we're excited about development going into 2019."

So the success of Taco Bell has been in place for a long time. Obviously, we had an acceleration in the back half of the year. We had 6% same-store sales growth in the back half, and obviously, a 9% system sales growth is a great number to finish the year on. It's -- there's no silver bullet. That team, led by Julie Masino, is just doing a great job across the board. We are known as the value leader. We are known as the innovation leader. As David said, we're running great operations. The assets are in great shape. The franchisees like their restaurant-level margins. And so I think when you add all that up, you just get a performance -- a consistent performance for the 7 years that Taco Bell has delivered and, we believe, will continue to deliver. 
So the brand is in great shape. Even the delivery advertising, which will launch today, I had a chance -- we were at a Taco Bell a couple of weeks ago. I've seen all the marketing around -- the advertising supporting the Grubhub launch. It's as good as any work I've ever seen come out of Taco Bell. So if we can accelerate our growth in delivery, I think that's all positive. So they're just doing everything right, led by a great executive team and a great president."

We don't want to go out and blow out without the integration because we know with great integration, it improves speed to service, it improves order accuracy, it does everything that the customer wants. And so you can say we've gone a little slow -- I would say we've gone a little slow early in order to accelerate going forward. So I'm very excited about the launch today for Taco Bell, and I'm very excited that more KFC restaurants will come onboard before the end of 2019. And all indications are, certainly in the early days, higher check, incremental transactions, all of that bodes well for both brands in the U.S."

We do think, long term, it will be accretive because we think it will accelerate the rate of our growth. And to your question about G&A, obviously, most master franchise agreements -- or the master franchisor, in this case, Telepizza, actually carries the G&A to manage the business. That's why we take a lower royalty. So we don't expect any increase in our G&A. In fact, it would be the opposite.

I'll begin with our 3 RED brands. In the first quarter, KFC Division delivered a system sales growth of 9% with same-store sales growth of 5% and net new-unit growth of 6%. This global powerhouse saw widespread strength coupled with standout performances in some of our larger markets, as well as a tailwind from lapping the distribution disruption in the U.K. last year. 
Internationally, callouts for the quarter include Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Africa and China. And you'll notice as I give some details, there are consistent themes, value and innovation working well together. 
Japan and Indonesia led the way, each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 15% same-store sales growth was driven by the well-received share pack as well as lunch value deals and hot and honey chicken on the bone innovation. 
Indonesia's 12% same-store sales growth was driven by value and innovation with Big Box value counterbalanced by the combo of superstar innovation. Australia same-store sales grew 6% on the back of the dual layer value combined with core product news. And Africa, were 10% same-store sales growth came as a result of strong value promotions, such as the Streetwise mix, coupled with an innovative Zinger chutney sandwich. 
Importantly, these markets maintain momentum in development while generating this strong same-store sales growth. Now to KFC U.S. where same-store sales grew 2%. We started the year off with a continued focus on value by introducing a new channel for a la carte menu items, offering our original famous bowls for just $3 and 2 Chicken Little's for $3. 
Both offers growth transaction for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. We then followed this up with new options in both the $5 Fill Up and $20 Family Meal offerings. Operational enhancements such as our new menu board design and delivery through Grubhub each positively contributed to first quarter sales. 
We now have 2,200 KFCs offering delivery and 3,200 restaurants available for click and collect on the Grubhub marketplace. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees, and we look forward to the nationwide launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later this year. Lastly, KFC continued its campaign of distinctive and truly breakthrough marketing from the KFC innovations lab. 
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., same-store sales were flat and system sales declined 1% due to a net new-unit decline of 1% as we continue to transform our asset base from dine-in to off-premise-focused assets. Pizza Hut U.S. continue to provide compelling value to customers by maintaining our $7.99 Large 2-Topping pizza deal and the $5 lineup. 
The $5 lineup, which features favorites like a medium 1 topping pizza, garlic knots, wings and Cinnabon Mini Rolls help drive traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. In March, we added a new teammate to the lineup with our pepperoni [indiscernible] showing our best innovation is accessible at a great price. 
As we've continued to reiterate for both the U.S. and the international businesses, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a small build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. We are encouraged by the steps we've taken to enhance assets, provide value offerings and improve operations to help our franchisees succeed. 
With that in mind, we are excited that our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage the Grubhub marketplace as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. We ended the first quarter with over 200 locations on the Grubhub marketplace. 
While customers are placing the orders on the Grubhub website, Pizza Hut delivery drivers are completing the orders. Now on to Pizza Hut International. System sales grew 13% in the quarter, including a benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year while same-store sales were flat. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong. As one example, Malaysia delivered a very strong same-store sales growth at 6% with their dominant value offering of buy 1 get 1 promotion. 
In regards to development, we continue to find success in our off-premise-focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. As we mentioned during our previous earnings call and at our Investor Day last year, the GAAP between dine-in channel sales and off-premise is significant with the U.S. and international seeing roughly 7-point and 6-point differentials between the 2 channels, respectively. 
In order to enhance the assets we view as the future of the brand, we are leveraging best practices from our strongest markets to provide targeted, compelling options in our off-premise-focused asset options. 
Last but not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 7%, with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 3%. Encouragingly, the U.S. same-store sales grew a healthy 5%, though, Taco Bell International caused the division to round down to 4%. 
Starting with the U.S., we began the quarter by showcasing $1 and $5 value and finished the quarter with innovation. Taco Bell continue to double down on value in the U.S. with the $1 grand burritos and the double Cheesy Gordita Crunch box. Our famous Nacho Fries came back again for a limited time and were so popular that yet again, 1 in 4 orders contained fries. 
We then finished the quarter off strong by introducing a new limited time offering: Steak Rattlesnake Fries. Our signature seasoned fries with marinated steak kicked up with a bit of creamy jalapeno sauce. Of course, Nacho Fries are cool to eat but they're also awesomely spicy. 
The official launch of Taco Bell delivery has been very encouraging. Having launched with marketing support in February, franchisees are all-in on this major initiative and are very excited about delivery as an opportunity to drive incremental sales and transactions. Given its early days, we aren't going to provide specific data, but I will say that both traffic and check saw benefits from the launch. 
Customers are also loving a new way to get their favorite Taco Bell products. Feedback has been positive plus the strength of our partnership with Grubhub has allowed for real-time feedback and learnings to continue to elevate the customer experience to even higher levels. Delivery is now live in over 4,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. 
Additionally, click and collect functionality is available on all tacobell.com and Taco Bell app while they're also testing this functionality through Grubhub. The Taco Bell International, there's a lot to be excited about. We expanded into the first new market of 2019 with the launch of Taco Bell Thailand where we hosted the launch party that generated nearly 0.5 billion impressions. 
Following from the U.S., we introduced value boxes around the world, which drove growth in the U.K., India and Japan. The U.K. opened its fifth restaurant in Central London and the GBP 5 Stacker Box was a success. India maintain momentum with positive same-store sales driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box. And Taco Bell's dedication to their purpose to feed people's life with más is shining through, and we are proud of the team and our franchise partners who work hard to bring this iconic brand to life. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, our 2 most important assets are our brands and our people. For us, Unrivaled Culture & Talent is a true competitive advantage and will continue to focus on it to fuel results and accelerate growth. 
In that 140 markets where we operate, it's our 2,000 franchisees and their employees who are delivering the customer experience at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. In fact, recently in Europe, David and I launched our next-generation leadership development costs for franchisees and employees called inspiring culture to fuel results. This is a program focused on building up our people to lead in a way that makes our 3 iconic brands relevant, easy and distinctive from the inside out. 
Because of the investment we continue to make in Unrivaled Culture & Talent, we're seeing a strong progress and results on the transformation and setting a healthy foundation for sustainable growth. In conclusion, I'm excited about the work we're doing with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build the world with more Yum! We remain confident as we relay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,604472890,1714739,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. To begin, our f",1779,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
To begin, our first quarter results. Consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth increased 12% and as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 4% and net new-unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 5% same-store sales growth and 6% net new-unit growth, driving 9% system sales growth in the quarter. 
It's great to see KFC offer such a strong start under new CEO, Tony Lowings. They're leaning in on same-store sales growth on top of what is already a development machine. Contributions to the KFC strength this quarter were broad-based. Japan, Indonesia and Africa, which together represent 9% of KFC's system sales, performs particularly well. 
Easier lapse at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another solid quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% same-store sales growth, including 5% in the U.S. As a reminder, our first quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, thereby having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. 
Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 5% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook. As it pertains specifically to 2019, our full year core operating growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily result of 3 factors: first, the rolloff of special media spending in 2018 related to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, the rolloff of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business, as we just discussed. 
I'll now update you on our EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus the adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items and any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
We estimated the benefit of the 53rd week into 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements remains a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. 
This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. First quarter 2019 special items are a $0.01 tailwind and first quarter Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.05 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reach in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.7% of system sales in the first quarter and this remains the appropriate target for 2019. As for CapEx, at our Investor Day, we discussed it in 3 buckets: run rate CapEx, targeted new equity units to spur additional growth that we would funds through refranchising a comparable number of units and potential strategic investments outside of the run rate that would create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees. 
I'd now like to elaborate on our thinking for 2019, including 2 positive updates. First, given strong returns on new equity builds, we see attractive opportunities to increase equity unit development to spur additional growth and generate excess returns. Again, these incremental units will be funded by a corresponding increase in the number of units refranchised, so our overall equity unit count remains unchanged. 
Second, we are now even more convinced there are attractive opportunities the lean in on strategic investments to generate faster growth and incremental value particularly as it pertains to technology. Importantly, much of this strategic spend is being or will be reimbursed by our franchised partners for services related to technology. Now, of course, these initiatives will drive gross CapEx higher near-term, and we now estimate our gross CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $225 million, inclusive of base CapEx, new equity builds and strategic investments in tech projects. However, on a net basis, meaning gross CapEx net of refranchising proceeds, we estimate closer to $125 million or only slightly higher than we previously discussed. 
Please note, 2019 does include a small incremental benefit from timing as we collect certain trailing proceeds related to our previous refranchising initiatives. One consequence of this outlook is that CapEx may exceed depreciation and amortization over the next few years, which could push our free cash flow conversion below 100%, dependent on the absolute level of spend in a given year. 
To be clear, we're excited by recent returns on investments beyond our base CapEx and believe that through a measured approach, we can enhanced growth and value creation for both our franchise partners and shareholders. 
As for capital return plans, our goal to return to $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $106 million at an average price of $94. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.4 billion in over 2 years of this program. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell as I recently had the opportunity to attend the 2019 franchise owners forum where franchisees from all over the U.S. shared their enthusiasm for the brand. I'm truly impressed by the positive spirit and growth mindset of all these franchise partners. 
In regards to operating initiatives, they're fast and friendly obsession is all about world-class service to our customers, not simply speed and efficiency. This is exactly why initiatives like this are so powerful because of efforts like this by our franchise partners, restaurant managers and employees that customer satisfaction and friendliness increased by 2 points year-over-year. 
Lastly, during the quarter, each of our service measures improved with a highlight being transaction times dropping 9 seconds from the previous year. At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our hot, fast and reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've improved our percentage of orders delivered in under 30 minutes by 3 percentage points year-over-year. 
At Pizza Hut International, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners. As a result, overall customer satisfaction scores have improved in these markets, which include India, France, Indonesia and Australia. Each increased their overall customer satisfaction score by 5% or more. 
KFC continues to drive taste as a key differentiator for the brand with a focus on elevating the role of the cook. This year, we are hosting taste talks across the globe to ensure finger lickin' good quality in every bite. We have seen improvement across the board on sharing improving ideas and global best practices, such as open kitchen tours and fast Fridays. Each of these examples show how we are leveraging our scale to adopt and share the best ideas. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 310 net new units. This represents a stepup in development from our recent historical rates, keeping us on track for 2019 to be the fourth consecutive year of increasing net new units openings. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued into 2019 with 265 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new-unit growth while at the same time we continue to transform our asset base to the American Showman image. 
We closed out the quarter with over 1,500 American Showman restaurants across the country as 65 remodels were completed in the U.S. during the quarter. Taco Bell continue to grow in the U.S. with 23 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 4 urban and Cantina asset formats opened including restaurants in New York and San Diego where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns and outperforming our closest competitors. 
Internationally, Taco Bell opened 10 net new units in markets, such as Japan, Thailand, India and the U.K. Lastly, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. The integration is off to a great start with our transition tasks largely complete. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza has worked closely on transferring and integrating Pizza Hut franchisees into their systems. 
Further, even during the most intense period for integration, Telepizza reported positive net new-unit growth and has begun converting Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand. As a reminder, we still anticipate between 100 and 150 units may close over time due to overlap. Though minimal of these closures have occurred thus far. 
To summarize, the first quarter was consistent with our expectations, which included [indiscernible] year. We're pleased with the result as they set us up to deliver on our commitments. With 3 category leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

Do you expect franchisee to contribute something to that? Or do you expect to get returns from that capital and technology because they're going to pay an incremental fee? And what is the nature, if you could describe a little bit more, just what the nature of those capital -- incremental capital investments are. That would be helpful."

Yes, we talked about this a little at the Investor Day when I presented what the $100 million of run rate CapEx and noted that we were contemplating an increase in equity development. And also that we were seeing good opportunities to invest further capital to create more shareholder value and improve the strength of our business. That's pretty much how this is playing out. So the original $100 million of run rate capital hasn't really changed. What's changed is our interest in building a little bit more equity units, all of which will be -- the capital for that will all be generated by refranchising a comparable number of units. In fact, the math on that is such that -- and this is why it's such a great shareholder value-enhancing move. We get more money when we sell a store than that it cost to build a new store. So we might get on average $2.5 million every time we sell the store and it costs more like $1.5 million or less to build a new store. So we're seeing sort of an arbitrage opportunity there to help spur development in certain parts of the country, particularly with Taco Bell where we do own a decent amount of equity stores. Some of the best examples are in your backyard in New York City where I was a couple of weeks ago visiting some of those great new Taco Bells that have opened. Those stores are worth substantially more than what we pay to build them. So we're going to build probably more -- 40 maybe 50 equity stores this year when the original plans were to build 5 to 10. So that's driving some of the incremental CapEx. 
And then on the other side of the equation, on strategic investments, we're looking at things like the recent acquisition we announced in the fourth quarter of QuikOrder where we bought the e-commerce provider for Pizza Hut, which I can tell you were just 1 quarter in, but has worked out incredibly well. I just -- actually this past weekend, left the Pizza Hut franchise convention and was talking to some of Pizza Hut franchisees there about us now owning QuikOrder, and they are really excited about our ability to create enhancements real-time on that platform and just having a lot more control over their tech future. But on the Pizza Hut platform, for example, there's a significant investment made to purchase that. In Q4, it has some follow-on CapEx investment this year because there are some contingency to the purchase price. And then there's capitalized G&A that comes along with making investments in tech companies, so some of that is going to start to show up on our CapEx line. The good news is, as you noted, John, we are recovering a lot of that -- a lot of our investment through service fees that franchisees pay for these to access these platforms. Again, our commitment to the franchise community is we're going to give them the best technology at the best price. But you'll see as we recover the cost of these platforms, which is why we say this is great for our franchisees, for our customers and for our shareholders. So we break the $225 million gross down, the excess above the $100 million run rate that we had quoted before, about half of that is due to equity development and half of that is due to technology and strategic investments."

As I travel the word and meet with the KFC teams, they're amazingly focused on making sure the KFC brand is more relevant, it's more easy and more distinct. In some markets, we may go to distinctive and not as relevant and are not as good as distinct, but I think the fact that we've got absolute just laser-like focus on making sure that each KFC brand in each country delivers on RED, I think that's certainly helping. I think secondly, as I did say in the prepared remarks, I think that value like a pound of food for $3, which KFC U.S. run, that may sound like simple communication. It's both distinctive and it's relevant. So I think that's great. The innovation that's happening, we are seeing a lot of great innovation, flavor innovation on existing forms and new form innovation also occurring. And then Brian, as you rightly said, we've got delivery and click and collect and equally in the U.S., we're excited that later this year will obviously do what Taco Bell has just done, which is put marketing mass effort behind delivery, which we think will accelerate that. So it's -- there's no silver bullet. It is really doing RED, incredibly well; value, incredibly well; innovation, incredibly well and a growing contribution from delivery. I think all of that is sustainable going forward, and that's why we remain very positive about the KFC brand."

And I guess I'm trying to understand, is there a scenario where you're repositioning the estate but it's happening at a time when aggregators are taking away some of the growth that the pizza category has had kind of to itself for so long? And then the related question is, what are you seeing in terms of the customers on Grub? Who find Grub versus the Pizza Hut app? Is it -- I assume a very different customer base, as we've heard from other restaurants. But given that Pizza Hut is so well known for its -- for delivery and pizza, I was just trying to figure out to what extent the Grub orders are incremental."

And so that is obviously a headwind we continue to have to work with. I do think the Pizza Hut brand, particularly in the U.S. and internationally, is doing a much better job at the foundations or the fundamentals. As David pointed out in his prepared remarks, temperatures improving, delivery times are getting lower. I think all of that is working. We're sustaining and we've got franchisee support to sustain. Obviously, great value so the $5 lineup. Adding which is both great innovation and at $5, obviously, I think we'll continue to ramp and you will see that play out I think later in the year. With regard to your question on aggregators, look, I think it's -- there's obviously negative impact but it's hard to measure what the cannibalization effect of aggregators on Pizza Hut -- on the pizza category. I think what's exciting for us is that we still think there's obviously a huge opportunity for Pizza Hut in the $40 billion pizza delivery business to do better. But at the same time, the nonpizza delivery market in the U.S. is worth about $100 billion. It's growing at 15% and now we're going to leverage Taco Bell and KFC to take advantage of that opportunity. So yes, a little bit of negative impact, but I see this whole opportunity of growth and delivery to be an upside for us, not a negative. And as we've only got about 200 stores at the moment, which are actually going through the Grubhub marketplace, it's not having a massive impact on our business. But I think the point you made is we are excited by the incremental customers we're seeing come through that marketplace but obviously the vast majority of the business is still coming through our Pizza Hut traditional business."

So we are accessing customers through this platform in some -- many cases that we wouldn't be able to access. That's why we're excited about the test. In fact, to the other part of your question, Sara, on the dine-in and the state, yes, Pizza Hut in the U.S. is the vast majority of our business comes to the delivery/carryout channels, but still close to half the assets are dine-in assets and there still a long process to take those process often, which are in the wrong part of the trade area and reposition them to the right part of the trade area or if they are in the right part of the trade area and oftentimes upgrading the asset to modern standards. So the challenges of the dine-in and state are very different internationally versus the U.S. In the U.S., we already have 90% of our business is on-premise but the assets are still a problem. Internationally, half of the assets are dine-in and the business has more of a 50-50 split to it. So very healthy assets in most cases around the world though. Before I -- we move on to the question, I just want to correct a comment from the prepared remarks that some of you probably caught. There was a typo. As far as the 2018 impact from the KFC U.K. supply disruption to Yum!, that impact was 1% on core operating profit in the second quarter, not the 5% that was stated. So I just want to make sure we all just have the right number there."

Look, I also do think, though, there is some sort of bifurcation going on in the marketplace, which is -- there are certainly people that are making a lot of money and there are certainly people where value will always remain incredibly important. And so I think that our focus on, as we said earlier, building this relevant, easy and distant, part of being relevant is to make sure we've got the right value proposition for every customer going in the marketplace. So we're going to focus on value, we're going to focus on innovation, we're going to focus on delivery and click and collect, as we've talked about. And it really is sort of partly get to your second question, which is the ability for us to sustain value on all 3 brands is predicated on our availability to get franchisee alignment. And what David and I are fundamentally focused on is making sure that at the core, franchise unit-level economics are getting better. And as they get better, then obviously franchisees will hang in on value, they will invest in new assets, refurbishing assets, they will support innovation. And so yes, I think the economy is in pretty good shape in the U.S. There are people who are benefiting, people who are not benefiting. We are going to stay on value. We are going to stay on innovation. We are going to say on relevant, easy distinct brands and I am really excited that the brands have worked incredibly hard with their franchise partners to ensure that we can sustain this sort of what I call really strong model going forward."

Then on the second question on the KFC global development, I mean we've been consistent in saying our goal is to ramp up the pace of development, we're pleased with the progress we've made. Obviously, Q1 in recent history was a record quarter for us in terms of net new units. And I do think the development momentum is widespread and will continue. We are confident that we can hit new highs this year versus last year. It isn't really sort of a timing issue. There's a good pipeline of deals for this year and for future years.

This quarter marks the start of the third and final year in our transformation of Yum! Brands. We're pleased to report a strong start to the year with first quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 4% system sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continue to fuel these results. 
As usual, David and I will walk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or as we say R.E.D. for short, as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
I'll begin with our 3 R.E.D. brands. In the first quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 9% with same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 6%. This global powerhouse saw widespread strength coupled with standout performances in some of our larger markets as well as a tailwind from lapping the distribution disruption in the U.K. last year. 
Internationally, callouts for the quarter include Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Africa and China. And you'll notice as I give some details, there are consistent themes: value and innovation working well together. 
Japan and Indonesia led the way, each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 15% same-store sales growth was driven by the well-received share pack as well as lunch value deals and hot and honey chicken on-the-bone innovation. 
Indonesia's 12% same-store sales growth was driven by value and innovation with Big Box value counterbalanced by the Kombo Super Star innovation. Australia same-store sales grew 6% on the back of the dual layer value combined with core product news. And Africa, were 10% same-store sales growth came as a result of strong value promotions, such as the Streetwise mix, coupled with an innovative Zinger Chutney sandwich. Importantly, these markets maintain momentum in development while generating this strong same-store sales growth. 
Now to KFC U.S. where same-store sales grew 2%. We started the year off with a continued focus on value by introducing a new channel for a la carte menu items, offering our original Famous Bowls for just $3 and 2 Chicken Littles for $3. Both offers drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. We then followed this up with new options in both the $5 Fill Up and $20 family meal offerings. Operational enhancements, such as a new menu board design and delivery through Grubhub each positively contributed to first quarter sales. 
We now have 2,200 KFCs offering delivery and 3,200 restaurants available for click and collect on the Grubhub marketplace. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth of our franchisees, and we look forward to the nationwide launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later this year. Lastly, KFC continued its campaign of distinctive and truly breakthrough marketing from the KFC Innovations Lab. 
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., same-store sales were flat and system sales declined 1% due to a net new unit decline of 1% as we continued to transform our asset base from dine-in to off-premise-focused assets. Pizza Hut U.S. continued to provide compelling value to customers by maintaining our $7.99 Large 2-Topping pizza deal and the $5 Lineup. 
The $5 Lineup, which features favorites like a medium 1-topping pizza, Garlic Knots, wings and Cinnabon Mini Rolls help drive traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. In March, we added a new teammate to the Lineup with our Pepperoni P'ZONE and showing our best innovation is accessible at a great price. 
As we've continued to reiterate for both the U.S. and the international businesses, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. We are encouraged by the steps we've taken to enhance assets, provide value offerings and improve operations to help our franchisees succeed. 
With that in mind, we are excited about our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage the Grubhub marketplace as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. We ended the first quarter with over 200 locations on the Grubhub marketplace. While customers are placing the orders on the Grubhub website, Pizza Hut delivery drivers are completing the orders. 
Now on to Pizza Hut International. System sales grew 13% in the quarter, including a benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year while same-store sales were flat. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong. As one example, Malaysia delivered a very strong same-store sales growth at 6% with their dominant value offering of buy 1 get 1 promotion. 
In regards to development, we continue to find success in our off-premise-focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. As we mentioned during our previous earnings call and at our Investor Day last year, the gap between dine-in channel sales and off-premise is significant with the U.S. and international seeing roughly 7-points and 6-point differentials between the 2 channels, respectively. In order to enhance the assets we view as the future of the brand, we are leveraging best practices from our strongest markets to provide targeted, compelling options in our off-premise-focused asset options. 
Last but not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 7%, with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 3%. Encouragingly, the U.S. same-store sales grew a healthy 5%, though Taco Bell International caused the division to round down to 4%. 
Starting with the U.S. We began the quarter by showcasing $1 and $5 value and finished the quarter with innovation. Taco Bell continued to double down on value in the U.S. with the $1 Grande Burritos and the Double Cheesy Gordita Crunch box. Our famous Nacho Fries came back for, again, for a limited time and were so popular that yet again, 1 in 4 orders contained fries. 
We then finished the quarter off strong by introducing a new limited time offering: Steak Rattlesnake Fries, our signature seasoned fries with marinated steak kicked up with a bit of creamy jalapeño sauce. Of course, Nacho Fries are cool to eat but they're also awesomely spicy. 
The official launch of Taco Bell delivery has been very encouraging. Having launched with marketing support in February, franchisees are all-in on this major initiative and are very excited about delivery as an opportunity to drive incremental sales and transactions. Given it's early days, we aren't going to provide specific data, but I will say that both traffic and check saw benefits from the launch. 
Customers are also loving the new way to get their favorite Taco Bell products. Feedback has been positive plus the strength of our partnership with Grubhub has allowed for real-time feedback and learnings to continue to elevate the customer experience to even higher levels. Delivery is now live in over 4,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available on all tacobell.com and Taco Bell app while they're also testing this functionality through Grubhub. 
For Taco Bell International, there's a lot to be excited about. We expanded into the first new market of 2019 with the launch of Taco Bell Thailand where we hosted a launch party that generated nearly 0.5 billion impressions. 
Borrowing from the U.S., we introduced value boxes around the world, which drove growth in the U.K., India and Japan. The U.K. opened its fifth restaurant in Central London and the GBP 5 Stacker Box was a success. India maintained momentum with positive same-store sales driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box. And Taco Bell's dedication to their purpose to feed people's life with más is shining through, and we are proud of the team and our franchise partners who work hard to bring this iconic brand to life. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, our 2 most important assets are our brands and our people. For us, Unrivaled Culture & Talent is a true competitive advantage, and we'll continue to focus on it to fuel results and accelerate growth. 
In that 140 markets where we operate, it's our 2,000 franchisees and their employees who are delivering the customer experience at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. In fact, recently in Europe, David and I launched our next-generation leadership development course for franchisees and employees called inspiring culture to fuel results. This is a program focused on building up our people to lead in a way that makes our 3 iconic brands Relevant, Easy and Distinctive from the inside out. Because of the investment we continue to make in Unrivaled Culture & Talent, we're seeing a strong progress and results on the transformation and setting a healthy foundation for sustainable growth. 
In conclusion, I'm excited about the work we're doing with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!. We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,604472890,1715055,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. To begin, our f",1794,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
To begin, our first quarter results. Consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth increased 12%. And as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 5% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth, driving 9% system sales growth in the quarter. 
It's great to see KFC off with such a strong start under new CEO, Tony Lowings. They're leaning in on same-store sales growth on top of what is already a development machine. Contributions to the KFC strength this quarter were broad-based. Japan, Indonesia and Africa, which together represent 9% of KFC's system sales, performed particularly well. 
Easier laps at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another solid quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% same-store sales growth, including 5% in the U.S. 
As a reminder, our first quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, thereby having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. 
Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 5% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook. As it pertains specifically to 2019, our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the roll-off of special media spending in 2018 related to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, the roll-off of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business, as we just discussed. 
I'll now update you on our EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus the adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items and any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements remains a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. 
First quarter 2019 special items are a $0.01 tailwind and first quarter Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.05 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.7% of system sales in the first quarter, and this remains the appropriate target for 2019. As for CapEx, at our Investor Day, we discussed it in 3 buckets: run rate CapEx, targeted new equity units to spur additional growth that we would fund through refranchising a comparable number of units, and potential strategic investments outside of the run rate that would create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees. 
I'd now like to elaborate on our thinking for 2019, including 2 positive updates. First, given strong returns on new equity builds, we see attractive opportunities to increase equity unit development to spur additional growth and generate excess returns. Again, these incremental units will be funded by a corresponding increase in the number of units refranchised, so our overall equity unit count remains unchanged. 
Second, we are now even more convinced there are attractive opportunities to lean in on strategic investments to generate faster growth and incremental value, particularly as it pertains to technology. Importantly, much of this strategic spend is being or will be reimbursed by our franchise partners for services related to technology. 
Now of course, these initiatives will drive gross CapEx higher near term, and we now estimate our gross CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $225 million, inclusive of base CapEx, new equity builds and strategic investments in tech projects. However, on a net basis, meaning gross CapEx net of refranchising proceeds, we estimate closer to $125 million or only slightly higher than we previously discussed. 
Please note, 2019 does include a small incremental benefit from timing as we collect certain trailing proceeds related to our previous refranchising initiatives. One consequence of this outlook is that CapEx may exceed depreciation and amortization over the next few years, which could push our free cash flow conversion below 100%, dependent on the absolute level of spend in a given year. To be clear, we're excited by recent returns on investments beyond our base CapEx and believe that through a measured approach, we can enhanced growth and value creation for both our franchise partners and shareholders. 
As for capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $106 million at an average price of $94. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.4 billion in over 2 years of this program. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell as I recently had the opportunity to attend the 2019 franchise owners' forum, where franchisees from all over the U.S. shared their enthusiasm for the brand. I'm truly impressed by the positive spirit and growth mindset of all these franchise partners. 
In regards to operating initiatives, they're fast-and-friendly obsession is all about world-class service to our customers, not simply speed and efficiency. This is exactly why initiatives like this are so powerful. It's because of efforts like this by our franchise partners, restaurant managers and employees that customer satisfaction and friendliness increased by 2 points year-over-year. Lastly, during the quarter, each of our service measures improved with a highlight being transaction times dropping 9 seconds from the previous year. 
At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our Hot, Fast and Reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've improved our percentage of orders delivered in under 30 minutes by 3 percentage points year-over-year. 
At Pizza Hut International, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners. As a result, overall customer satisfaction scores have improved in these markets, which include India, France, Indonesia and Australia. Each increased their overall customer satisfaction score by 5% or more. 
KFC continues to drive taste as a key differentiator for the brand with a focus on elevating the role of the cook. This year, we are hosting Taste Talks across the globe to ensure finger lickin' good quality in every bite. We have seen improvement across the board on sharing proven ideas and global best practices, such as Open Kitchen tours and fast Fridays. Each of these examples show how we are leveraging our scale to adopt and share the best ideas. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 310 net new units. This represents a step-up in development from our recent historical rates, keeping us on track for 2019 to be the fourth consecutive year of increasing net new unit openings. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued into 2019 with 265 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continued to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time, we continued to transform our asset base to the American Showman image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,500 American Showman restaurants across the country as 65 remodels were completed in the U.S. during the quarter. 
Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 23 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 4 urban and Cantina asset formats opened, including restaurants in New York and San Diego where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns and outperforming our closest competitors. 
Internationally, Taco Bell opened 10 net new units in markets, such as Japan, Thailand, India and the U.K. 
Lastly, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. The integration is off to a great start with our transition tasks largely complete. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza has worked closely on transferring and integrating Pizza Hut franchisees into their systems. 
Further, even during the most intense period for integration, Telepizza reported positive net new unit growth and has begun converting Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand. As a reminder, we still anticipate between 100 and 150 units may close over time due to overlap, though minimal of these closures have occurred thus far. 
To summarize, the first quarter was consistent with our expectations, which included easier laps in the first half of the year. We're pleased with the results as they set us up to deliver on our commitments. With 3 category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

And what is the nature, if you could describe a little bit more, just what the nature of those capital -- incremental capital investments are. That would be helpful."
365997,604472890,1715055,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Sure, John.

We talked about this a little at the Investor Day when I presented what -- the $100 million of run rate CapEx and noted that we were contemplating an increase in equity development. And also that we were seeing good opportunities to invest further capital to create more shareholder value and improve the strength of our business. That's pretty much how this is playing out. So the original $100 million of run rate capital hasn't really changed. What's changed is our interest in building a little bit more equity units, all of which will be -- the capital for that will all be generated by refranchising a comparable number of units. In fact, the math on that is such that -- and this is why it's such a great shareholder value-enhancing move. We get more money when we sell a store than it cost to build a new store. So we might get on average $2.5 million every time we sell the store, and it costs more like $1.5 million or less to build a new store. 
So we're seeing sort of an arbitrage opportunity there to help spur development in certain parts of the country, particularly with Taco Bell where we do own a decent amount of equity stores. Some of the best examples are in your backyard in New York City, where I was a couple of weeks ago visiting some of those great new Taco Bells that have opened. Those stores are worth substantially more than what we paid to build them. So we're going to build probably more -- 40 maybe 50 equity stores this year when the original plans were only to build 5 to 10. So that's driving some of the incremental CapEx. 
And then on the other side of the equation, on strategic investments, we're looking at things like the recent acquisition we announced in the fourth quarter of QuikOrder where we bought the e-commerce provider for Pizza Hut, which I can tell you, we're just 1 quarter in, but has worked out incredibly well. I just -- actually this past weekend, left the Pizza Hut franchise convention and was talking to some of Pizza Hut franchisees there about us now owning QuikOrder. And they are really excited about our ability to create enhancements real-time on that platform and just having a lot more control over their tech future. 
But on the Pizza Hut platform, for example, there's a significant investment made to purchase that in Q4. It has some follow-on CapEx investment this year because there's some contingency to the purchase price. And then there's capitalized G&A that comes along with making investments in tech companies, so some of that is going to start to show up on our CapEx line. 
The good news is, as you noted, John, is we are recovering a lot of that -- a lot of our investment through the service fees that franchisees pay for these to access these platforms. Again, our commitment to the franchise community is we're going to give them the best technology at the best price. But you'll see us recover the cost of these platforms, which is why we say this is great for our franchisees, for our customers and for our shareholders. So if we break the $225 million gross down, the excess above the $100 million run rate that we had quoted before, about half of that is due to equity development and half of that is due to technology and strategic investments."

I think it really fundamentally starts with our focus on what we call R.E.D., Relevant, Easy and Distinct. As I travel the world and meet with the KFC teams, they're amazingly focused on making sure the KFC brand is more relevant, it's more easy and more distinct. Now in some markets, we may be good at distinctive and not as good as relevant. In others, they're good at relevant but they're not as good as distinct. But I think the fact that we've got absolute just laser-like focus on making sure that each KFC brand in each country delivers on R.E.D., I think that's certainly helping. 
I think secondly, as I did say in the prepared remarks, I think that value like a pound of food for $3, which KFC U.S. ran, that may sound like simple communication. It's both distinctive and it's relevant. So I think that's great. The innovation that's happening, we are seeing a lot of great innovation, flavor innovation on existing forms and new form innovation also occurring. And then Brian, as you rightly say, we've got delivery and click and collect. And equally in the U.S., we're excited that later this year, we'll obviously do what Taco Bell has just done, which is put marketing muscle on effort behind delivery, which we think will accelerate that. 
So it's -- there's no silver bullet. It is really doing R.E.D. incredibly well; value, incredibly well; innovation, incredibly well and a growing contribution from delivery. I think all of that is sustainable going forward. And that's why we remain very positive about the KFC brand."

But I guess I'm -- when I think about the U.S., it's so much a carryout and delivery business that the implication is that even that business might still be sort of muted in terms of comps. And I guess I'm trying to understand is there a scenario where you're repositioning the estate but it's happening at a time when aggregators are taking away some of the growth that the pizza category has had kind of to itself for so long? 
And then the related question is what are you seeing in terms of the customers on Grub? Who find you through Grub versus the Pizza Hut app? Is it -- I assume a very different customer base, as we've heard from other restaurants. But given that Pizza Hut is so well-known for its -- for delivering pizza, I'm just trying to figure out to what extent the Grub orders are incremental."

Well, as you said, dine-in does lag by about 7 points on the sales growth line between off-premise and on-premise. And so that is obviously a headwind we continue to have to work with.

And so that is obviously a headwind we continue to have to work with. I do think the Pizza Hut brand, particularly in the U.S. and internationally, is doing a much better job at the foundations or the fundamentals. As David pointed out in his prepared remarks, temperature is improving, delivery times are getting lower. I think all of that is working. We're sustaining, and we've got franchisee support to sustain. Obviously, great value, you saw the $5 Lineup. Adding P'ZONE which is both great innovation and at $5, obviously, I think will continue to move up, and we'll will see that play out I think later in the year. 
With regard to your question on aggregators, look, I think it's -- there's obviously a negative impact. But it's hard to measure what the cannibalization effect is of aggregators on Pizza Hut -- on the pizza category. I think what's exciting for us is that we still think there's obviously a huge opportunity for Pizza Hut in the $40 billion pizza delivery business to do better. But at the same time, the nonpizza delivery market in the U.S. is worth about $100 billion. It's growing at 15% and now we're going to leverage Taco Bell and KFC to take advantage of that opportunity. So yes, a little bit of negative impact, but I see this whole opportunity of growth in delivery to be an upside for us, not a negative. 
And as we've only got about 200 stores at the moment, which are actually going through the Grubhub marketplace, it's not having a massive impact on our business. But I think the point you made is we are excited by the incremental customers we're seeing come through that marketplace. But obviously, the vast majority of the business is still coming through our Pizza Hut traditional business."
365997,604472890,1715055,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum!

But we are accessing customers through their platform in some -- many cases that we wouldn't be able to access. That's why we're excited about the test. 
In fact, to the other part of your question, Sara, on the dine-in estate, yes, Pizza Hut in the U.S. is -- the vast majority of our business comes through the delivery/carryout channels. But still, close to half the assets are dine-in assets, and there is still a long process to take those assets off and which are in the wrong part of the trade area and reposition them to the right part of the trade area or if they are in the right part of the trade area, and oftentimes upgrading the asset to modern standards. 
So the challenges of the dine-in estate are very different internationally versus the U.S. In the U.S., we already have -- 90% of our business is off-premise, but the assets are still a problem. Internationally, half of the assets are dine-in, and the business has more of a 50-50 split to it. So very healthy assets in most cases around the world though. 
Before we move on to the question, I just want to correct a comment from the prepared remarks that some of you probably caught. There was a typo. As far as the 2018 impact from the KFC U.K. supply disruption to Yum!, that impact was 1% on core operating profit in the second quarter, not the 5% that was stated. So I just want to make sure we all have the right number there."

You saw a lot of the upside in -- as in most previous quarters, is driven by Yum China. And as I've talked about, they're happy with the returns they're getting for KFC China. So lots of reasons to be optimistic about global development."

And as I said, I think the bucket is an incredible delivery device. It really delivers piping hot, great-tasting food. And I think that's also a benefit that the KFC customer is currently seeing, which is getting restaurant-quality food delivered to your house. So all going well and looking forward to the launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later in the year, which I think will be an exciting time. And we think obviously, positive things will come out of that as well. 
Okay. Just some closing remarks. So first of all, I want to thank you -- thank everyone for being on the call today. Second, I am pleased that we're off to a strong start in 2019. In fact, when I look at the metrics that best indicate the underlying health of the business, so those without noise and special items or mark-to-market on our Grub -- our investment in Grubhub, I think there's a lot to be excited about. We delivered 8% system sales growth, 12% core operating profit growth and 18% EPS growth. So I'm very confident that our enviable business, underpinned by unrivaled culture, will deliver lasting growth that maximizes shareholders value in 2019 and beyond. Thanks for being on the call with us today."

This quarter marks the start of the third and final year in our transformation of Yum! Brands. We're pleased to report a strong start to the year with first quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 4% system sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continue to fuel these results. 
As usual, David and I will walk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or, as we say, R.E.D. for short, as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
I'll begin with our 3 R.E.D. brands. In the first quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 9% with same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 6%. This global powerhouse saw widespread strength coupled with standout performances in some of our larger markets as well as a tailwind from lapping the distribution disruption in the U.K. last year. Internationally, callouts for the quarter include Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Africa and China. And you'll notice as I give some details, there are consistent themes: value and innovation working well together. 
Japan and Indonesia led the way, each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 15% same-store sales growth was driven by the well-received share pack as well as lunch value deals and hot and honey chicken on-the-bone innovation. Indonesia's 12% same-store sales growth was driven by value and innovation with Big Box value counterbalanced by the Kombo Super Star innovation. 
Australia same-store sales grew 6% on the back of the dual-layer value combined with core product news. And Africa, where 10% same-store sales growth came as a result of strong value promotions, such as the Streetwise mix, coupled with an innovative Zinger Chutney sandwich. Importantly, these markets maintain momentum in development while generating this strong same-store sales growth.  
Now to KFC U.S. where same-store sales grew 2%. We started the year off with a continued focus on value by introducing a new channel for a la carte menu items: offering our original Famous Bowls for just $3 and 2 Chicken Littles for $3. Both offers drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. We then followed this up with new options in both the $5 Fill Up and $20 family meal offerings. 
Operational enhancements, such as a new menu board design and delivery through Grubhub, each positively contributed to first quarter sales. We now have 2,200 KFCs offering delivery and 3,200 restaurants available for click and collect on the Grubhub marketplace. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees, and we look forward to the nationwide launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later this year. Lastly, KFC continued its campaign of distinctive and truly breakthrough marketing from the KFC Innovations Lab. 
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., same-store sales were flat and system sales declined 1% due to a net new unit decline of 1% as we continued to transform our asset base from dine-in to off-premise-focused assets. Pizza Hut U.S. continued to provide compelling value to customers by maintaining our $7.99 Large 2-Topping pizza deal and the $5 Lineup. The $5 Lineup, which features favorites like a medium 1-topping pizza, garlic knots, wings and Cinnabon Mini Rolls, helped drive traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. In March, we added a new teammate to the Lineup with our Pepperoni P'ZONE, ensuring our best innovation is accessible at a great price. 
As we've continued to reiterate, for both the U.S. and the international businesses, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. We are encouraged by the steps we've taken to enhance assets, provide value offerings and improve operations to help our franchisees succeed. 
With that in mind, we are excited about our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage the Grubhub marketplace as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. We ended the first quarter with over 200 locations on the Grubhub marketplace. While customers are placing the orders on the Grubhub website, Pizza Hut delivery drivers are completing the orders. 
Now on to Pizza Hut International. System sales grew 13% in the quarter, including a benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales were flat. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong. As one example, Malaysia delivered a very strong same-store sales growth at 6% with their dominant value offering a buy 1 get 1 promotion. 
In regards to development, we continue to find success in our off-premise-focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. As we mentioned during our previous earnings call and at our Investor Day last year, the gap between dine-in channel sales and off-premise is significant with the U.S. and international seeing roughly 7-point and 6-point differentials between the 2 channels, respectively. In order to enhance the assets we view as the future of the brand, we are leveraging best practices from our strongest markets to provide targeted compelling options in our off-premise-focused asset options. 
Last but not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 3%. Encouragingly, the U.S. same-store sales grew a healthy 5%, though Taco Bell International caused the division to round down to 4%. 
Starting with the U.S. We began the quarter by showcasing $1 and $5 value and finished the quarter with innovation. Taco Bell continued to double down on value in the U.S. with the $1 Grande Burritos and the Double Cheesy Gordita Crunch box. Our famous Nacho Fries came back for -- again, for a limited time and were so popular that yet again, 1 in 4 orders contained fries. 
We then finished the quarter off strong by introducing a new limited time offering: Steak Rattlesnake Fries, our signature seasoned fries with marinated steak kicked up with a bit of creamy jalapeño sauce. Of course, Nacho Fries are cool to eat but they're also awesomely spicy. 
The official launch of Taco Bell delivery has been very encouraging. Having launched with marketing support in February, franchisees are all-in on this major initiative and are very excited about delivery as an opportunity to drive incremental sales and transactions. Given it's early days, we aren't going to provide specific data, but I will say that both traffic and check saw benefits from the launch. 
Customers are also loving the new way to get their favorite Taco Bell products. Feedback has been positive, plus the strength of our partnership with Grubhub has allowed for real-time feedback and learnings to continue to elevate the customer experience to even higher levels. Delivery is now live in over 4,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S., and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available on all tacobell.com and Taco Bell app while we're also testing this functionality through Grubhub. 
For Taco Bell International, there's a lot to be excited about. We expanded into the first new market of 2019 with the launch of Taco Bell Thailand where we hosted a launch party that generated nearly 0.5 billion impressions. 
Borrowing from the U.S., we introduced value boxes around the world, which drove growth in the U.K., India and Japan. The U.K. opened its fifth restaurant in Central London and the GBP 5 Stacker Box was a success. India maintained momentum with positive same-store sales driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box. And Taco Bell's dedication to their purpose to feed people's lives with más is shining through, and we are proud of the team and our franchise partners who worked hard to bring this iconic brand to life. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, our 2 most important assets are our brands and our people. For us, Unrivaled Culture & Talent is a true competitive advantage, and we'll continue to focus on it to fuel results and accelerate growth. 
In the 140 markets where we operate, it's our 2,000 franchisees and their employees who are delivering the customer experience at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. In fact, recently in Europe, David and I launched our next-generation leadership development course for franchisees and employees called Inspiring Culture to Fuel Results. This is a program focused on building up our people to lead in a way that makes our 3 iconic brands Relevant, Easy and Distinctive from the inside out. Because of the investment we continue to make in Unrivaled Culture & Talent, we're seeing a strong progress and results on the transformation and setting a healthy foundation for sustainable growth. 
In conclusion, I'm excited about the work we're doing with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!. We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,604472890,1715153,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. To begin, our f",1796,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
To begin, our first quarter results. Consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth increased 12%. And as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 5% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 9% system sales growth in the quarter. 
It's great to see KFC off with such a strong start under new CEO, Tony Lowings. They're leaning in on same-store sales growth on top of what is already a development machine. Contributions to the KFC strength this quarter were broad-based. Japan, Indonesia and Africa, which together represent 9% of KFC's system sales, performed particularly well. Easier laps at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another solid quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% same-store sales growth, including 5% in the U.S. 
As a reminder, our first quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, thereby having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. 
Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 5% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook. As it pertains specifically to 2019, our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the roll-off of special media spending in 2018 related to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, the roll-off of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business, as we just discussed. 
I'll now update you on our EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus the adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items and any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
We estimated the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements remains a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. 
First quarter 2019 special items are a $0.01 tailwind and first quarter Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.05 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.7% of system sales in the first quarter, and this remains the appropriate target for 2019. As for CapEx, at our Investor Day, we discussed it in 3 buckets: run rate CapEx, targeted new equity units to spur additional growth that we would fund through refranchising a comparable number of units and potential strategic investments outside of the run rate that would create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees. 
I'd now like to elaborate on our thinking for 2019, including 2 positive updates. First, given strong returns on new equity builds, we see attractive opportunities to increase equity unit development to spur additional growth and generate excess returns. Again, these incremental units will be funded by a corresponding increase in the number of units refranchised, so our overall equity unit count remains unchanged. 
Second, we are now even more convinced there are attractive opportunities to lean in on strategic investments to generate faster growth and incremental value, particularly as it pertains to technology. Importantly, much of this strategic spend is being or will be reimbursed by our franchise partners for services related to technology. 
Now of course, these initiatives will drive gross CapEx higher near term, and we now estimate our gross CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $225 million, inclusive of base CapEx, new equity builds and strategic investments in tech projects. However, on a net basis, meaning gross CapEx net of refranchising proceeds, we estimate closer to $125 million or only slightly higher than we previously discussed. Please note, 2019 does include a small incremental benefit from timing as we collect certain trailing proceeds related to our previous refranchising initiatives. 
One consequence of this outlook is that CapEx may exceed depreciation and amortization over the next few years, which could push our free cash flow conversion below 100%, dependent on the absolute level of spend in a given year. To be clear, we're excited by recent returns on investments beyond our base CapEx and believe that through a measured approach, we can enhanced growth and value creation for both our franchise partners and shareholders. 
As for capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $106 million at an average price of $94. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.4 billion in over 2 years of this program. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell as I recently had the opportunity to attend the 2019 franchise owners' forum, where franchisees from all over the U.S. shared their enthusiasm for the brand. I'm truly impressed by the positive spirit and growth mindset of all these franchise partners. 
In regards to operating initiatives, their fast and friendly obsession is all about world-class service to our customers, not simply speed and efficiency. This is exactly why initiatives like this are so powerful. It's because of efforts like this by our franchise partners, restaurant managers and employees that customer satisfaction and friendliness increased by 2 points year-over-year. 
Lastly, during the quarter, each of our service measures improved with the highlight being transaction times dropping 9 seconds from the previous year. 
At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our Hot, Fast and Reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've improved our percentage of orders delivered in under 30 minutes by 3 percentage points year-over-year. 
At Pizza Hut International, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners. As a result, overall customer satisfaction scores have improved in these markets, which include India, France, Indonesia and Australia. Each increased their overall customer satisfaction score by 5% or more. 
KFC continues to drive taste as a key differentiator for the brand with a focus on elevating the role of the cook. This year, we are hosting Taste Talks across the globe to ensure finger lickin' good quality in every bite. We have seen improvement across the board on sharing proven ideas and global best practices, such as Open Kitchen tours and Fast Fridays. Each of these examples show how we are leveraging our scale to adopt and share the best ideas. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 310 net new units. This represents a step-up in development from our recent historical rates, keeping us on track for 2019 to be the fourth consecutive year of increasing net new unit openings. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued into 2019 with 265 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continued to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time, we continued to transform our asset base to the American Showman image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,500 American Showman restaurants across the country as 65 remodels were completed in the U.S. during the quarter. 
Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 23 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 4 urban and Cantina asset formats opened, including restaurants in New York and San Diego where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns and outperforming our closest competitors. Internationally, Taco Bell opened 10 net new units in markets such as Japan, Thailand, India and the U.K. 
Lastly, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. The integration is off to a great start with our transition tasks largely complete. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza has worked closely on transferring and integrating Pizza Hut franchisees into their systems. Further, even during the most intense period for integration, Telepizza reported positive net new unit growth and has begun converting Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand. As a reminder, we still anticipate between 100 and 150 units may close over time due to overlap, though minimal of these closures have occurred thus far. 
To summarize, the first quarter was consistent with our expectations, which included easier laps in the first half of the year. We're pleased with the results as they set us up to deliver on our commitments. With 3 category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day when I presented what -- the $100 million of run rate CapEx and noted that we were contemplating an increase in equity development and also that we were seeing good opportunities to invest",589,"Sure, John. We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day when I presented what -- the $100 million of run rate CapEx and noted that we were contemplating an increase in equity development and also that we were seeing good opportunities to invest further capital to create more shareholder value and improve the strength of our business. That's pretty much how this is playing out. So the original $100 million of run rate capital hasn't really changed. What's changed is our interest in building a little bit more equity units, all of which will be -- the capital for that will all be generated by refranchising a comparable number of units. In fact, the math on that is such that -- and this is why it's such a great shareholder value-enhancing move. We get more money when we sell a store than it cost to build a new store. So we might get on average $2.5 million every time we sell a store, and it costs more like $1.5 million or less to build a new store. 
So we're seeing sort of an arbitrage opportunity there to help spur development in certain parts of the country, particularly with Taco Bell where we do own a decent amount of equity stores. Some of the best examples are in your backyard in New York City, where I was a couple of weeks ago, visiting some of those great new Taco Bells that have opened. Those stores are worth substantially more than what we paid to build them. So we're going to build probably more -- 40, maybe 50 equity stores this year when the original plans were only to build 5 to 10. So that's driving some of the incremental CapEx. 
And then on the other side of the equation, on strategic investments, we're looking at things like the recent acquisition we announced in the fourth quarter of QuikOrder where we bought the e-commerce provider for Pizza Hut, which I can tell you, we're just 1 quarter in, but has worked out incredibly well. I just, actually this past weekend, left the Pizza Hut franchise convention and was talking to some of the Pizza Hut franchisees there about us now owning QuikOrder. And they are really excited about our ability to create enhancements real time on that platform and just having a lot more control over their tech future. 
But on the Pizza Hut platform, for example, there's a significant investment made to purchase that in Q4. It has some follow-on CapEx investment this year because there's some contingency to the purchase price. And then there's capitalized G&A that comes along with making investments in tech companies, so some of that is going to start to show up on our CapEx line. 
The good news is -- as you noted, John, is we are recovering a lot of that -- a lot of our investment through the service fees that franchisees pay for these to access these platforms. Again, our commitment to the franchise community is we're going to give them the best technology at the best price. But you'll see us recover the cost of these platforms, which is why we say this is great for our franchisees, for our customers and for our shareholders. So if you break the $225 million gross down, the excess above the $100 million run rate that we had quoted before, about half of that is due to equity development and half of that is due to technology and strategic investments."

Greg, you dove into a couple of drivers in your prepared remarks, lapping the U.K. issues. And we also heard from Yum China this week.

And is your delivery initiatives you've talked about for a couple of years outside the U.S. really starting to drive some incremental momentum for you now?

I think it really fundamentally starts with our focus on what we call R.E.D., Relevant, Easy and Distinct. As I travel the world and meet with the KFC teams, they're amazingly focused on making sure the KFC brand is more relevant, it's more easy and more distinct. Now in some markets, we may be good at distinctive and not as good at relevant. In others, we're good at relevant but we're not as good at distinct. But I think the fact that we've got absolute just laser-like focus on making sure that each KFC brand in each country delivers on R.E.D., I think that's certainly helping. 
I think secondly, as I did say in the prepared remarks, I think the value, like a pound of food for $3, which KFC U.S. ran, that may sound like simple communication. It's both distinctive and it's relevant. So I think that's great. The innovation that's happening, we are seeing a lot of great innovation, flavor innovation on existing forms and new form innovation also occurring. And then, Brian, as you rightly say, we've got delivery and click and collect. And equally, in the U.S., we're excited that later this year, we'll obviously do what Taco Bell has just done, which is put marketing muscle and effort behind delivery, which we think will accelerate that. 
So it's -- there's no silver bullet. It is really doing R.E.D. incredibly well, value incredibly well, innovation incredibly well and a growing contribution from delivery. I think all of that is sustainable going forward. And that's why we remain very positive about the KFC brand."

But I guess I'm -- when I think about the U.S., it's so much a carryout and delivery business that the implication is that even that business might still be sort of muted in terms of comps. And I guess I'm trying to understand is there a scenario where you're repositioning the estate but it's happening at a time when aggregators are taking away some of the growth that the pizza category has had kind of to itself for so long? 
And then the related question is what are you seeing in terms of the customers on Grub -- who find you through Grub versus the Pizza Hut app? Is it -- I assume a very different customer base, as we've heard from other restaurants. But given that Pizza Hut is so well known for its -- for delivering pizza, I'm just trying to figure out to what extent the Grub orders are incremental."
365997,604472890,1715153,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Sure. Well, as you said, dine-in does lag by about 7 points on the sales growth line between off-premise and on-premise. And so that is obviously a headwind that we continue to have to work with.

And so that is obviously a headwind that we continue to have to work with. I do think the Pizza Hut brand, particularly in the U.S. and internationally, is doing a much better job at the foundations or the fundamentals. As David pointed out in his prepared remarks, temperature is improving, delivery times are getting lower. I think all of that is working. We're sustaining and we've got franchisee support to sustain obviously great value. You saw the $5 Lineup. Adding P'ZONE which is both great innovation and at $5, obviously, I think will continue to help and we will see that play out I think later in the year. 
With regard to your question on aggregators, look, I think it's -- there's obviously a negative impact, but it's hard to measure what the cannibalization effect is of aggregators on Pizza Hut -- on the pizza category. I think what's exciting for us is that we still think there's obviously a huge opportunity for Pizza Hut in the $40 billion pizza delivery business to do better. But at the same time, the non-pizza delivery market in the U.S. is worth about $100 billion. It's growing at 15%, and now we're going to leverage Taco Bell and KFC to take advantage of that opportunity. So yes, a little bit of negative impact, but I see this whole opportunity of growth in delivery to be an upside for us, not a negative. 
And as we've only got about 200 stores at the moment which are actually going through the Grubhub marketplace, it's not having a massive impact on our business. But I think the point you made is we are excited by the incremental customers we're seeing come through that marketplace. But obviously, the vast majority of the business is still coming through our Pizza Hut traditional business."
365997,604472890,1715153,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

I mean -- and on the Grubhub pizza, I think we are encouraged that there are different customers on Grubhub versus many of the customers that use Pizza Hut directly. So we are accessing customers through their platform in some -- many cases that we wouldn't be able to access. That's why we're excited about the test. 
Back to the other part of your question, Sara, on the dine-in estate. Yes, Pizza Hut in the U.S. is -- the vast majority of our business comes through the delivery/carryout channels. But still, close to half the assets are dine-in assets, and there is still a long process to take those assets, often which are in the wrong part of the trade area, and reposition them to the right part of the trade area or if they are in the right part of the trade area, oftentimes upgrading the asset to modern standards. 
So the challenges of the dine-in estate are very different internationally versus the U.S. In the U.S., we already have -- 90% of our business is off-premise, but the assets are still a problem. Internationally, half of the assets are dine-in, and the business has more of a 50-50 split to it. So very healthy assets in most cases around the world though. 
Before we move on to the next question, I just want to correct a comment from the prepared remarks that some of you probably caught. There was a typo. As far as the 2018 impact from the KFC U.K. supply disruption to Yum!, that impact was 1% on core operating profit in the second quarter, not the 5% that was stated. So I just want to make sure we all have the right number there."

Look, obviously, the U.S. economy is in pretty good shape. We all saw the GDP numbers for Q1 from the government. Look, I also do think, though, there is some sort of bifurcation going on in the marketplace, which is there are certainly people that are making a lot of money and there are certainly people where value will always remain incredibly important. And so I think that our focus on, as we said earlier, building this Relevant, Easy and Distinct, part of being relevant is to make sure we've got the right value proposition for every customer we've got in the marketplace. So we're going to focus on value. We're going to focus on innovation. We're going to focus on delivery and click and collect, as we've talked about. 
And it really is -- sort of part, I guess, of your second question, which is the ability for us to sustain value on all 3 brands is predicated on our ability to get franchisee alignment. And I think what David and I are fundamentally focused on is making sure that at the core, franchise unit-level economics are getting better. And as they get better, then obviously franchisees will hang in on value, they will invest in new assets, refurbishing assets, they will support innovation. 
And so yes, I think the economy is in pretty good shape in the U.S. There are people who are benefiting, people who are not benefiting. We are going to stay on value. We are going to stay on innovation. We are going to stay on building these Relevant, Easy and Distinct brands.

Then on the second question on the KFC global development, I mean, we've been consistent in saying our goal is to ramp up the pace of development. We're pleased with the progress we've made. Obviously, Q1 in recent history was a record quarter for us in terms of net new units. And I do think the development momentum is widespread and will continue. We are confident that we can hit new highs this year versus last year. It isn't really sort of a timing issue. There's a good pipeline of deals for this year and for future years.

This quarter marks the start of the third and final year in our transformation of Yum! Brands. We're pleased to report a strong start to the year with first quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 4% syst",1565,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. This quarter marks the start of the third and final year in our transformation of Yum! Brands. We're pleased to report a strong start to the year with first quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 4% system sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continue to fuel these results. 
As usual, David and I will walk you through the lens of these 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or, as we say, R.E.D. for short, as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
I'll begin with our 3 R.E.D. brands. In the first quarter, KFC Division delivered system sales growth of 9% with same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 6%. This global powerhouse saw widespread strength coupled with standout performances in some of our larger markets as well as a tailwind from lapping the distribution disruption in the U.K. last year. Internationally, callouts for the quarter include Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Africa and China. And you'll notice as I give some details, there are consistent themes: value and innovation working well together. 
Japan and Indonesia led the way, each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 15% same-store sales growth was driven by the well-received share pack as well as lunch value deals and hot and honey chicken on-the-bone innovation. Indonesia's 12% same-store sales growth was driven by value and innovation with Big Box value counterbalanced by the Kombo Super Star innovation. 
Australia same-store sales grew 6% on the back of the dual-layer value combined with core product news. And Africa, where 10% same-store sales growth came as a result of strong value promotions, such as the Streetwise mix, coupled with an innovative Zinger Chutney sandwich. Importantly, these markets maintain momentum in development while generating this strong same-store sales growth.  
Now to KFC U.S. where same-store sales grew 2%. We started the year off with a continued focus on value by introducing a new channel for a la carte menu items: offering our original Famous Bowls for just $3 and 2 Chicken Littles for $3. Both offers drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. We then followed this up with new options in both the $5 Fill Up and $20 family meal offerings. 
Operational enhancements, such as a new menu board design and delivery through Grubhub, each positively contributed to first quarter sales. We now have 2,200 KFCs offering delivery and 3,200 restaurants available for click and collect on the Grubhub marketplace. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees, and we look forward to the nationwide launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later this year. Lastly, KFC continued its campaign of distinctive and truly breakthrough marketing from the KFC Innovations Lab. 
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., same-store sales were flat and system sales declined 1% due to a net new unit decline of 1% as we continued to transform our asset base from dine-in to off-premise-focused assets. Pizza Hut U.S. continued to provide compelling value to customers by maintaining our $7.99 Large 2-Topping pizza deal and the $5 Lineup. The $5 Lineup, which features favorites like a medium 1-topping pizza, garlic knots, wings and Cinnabon Mini Rolls, helped drive traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. In March, we added a new teammate to the Lineup with our Pepperoni P'ZONE, ensuring our best innovation is accessible at a great price. 
As we've continued to reiterate, for both the U.S. and the international businesses, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. We are encouraged by the steps we've taken to enhance assets, provide value offerings and improve operations to help our franchisees succeed. 
With that in mind, we are excited about our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage the Grubhub marketplace as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. We ended the first quarter with over 200 locations on the Grubhub marketplace. While customers are placing the orders on the Grubhub website, Pizza Hut delivery drivers are completing the orders. 
Now on to Pizza Hut International. System sales grew 13% in the quarter, including a benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales were flat. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong. As one example, Malaysia delivered a very strong same-store sales growth at 6% with their dominant value offering a buy 1 get 1 promotion. 
In regards to development, we continue to find success in our off-premise-focused asset options, including delcos, fast casual delcos and Express units. As we mentioned during our previous earnings call and at our Investor Day last year, the gap between dine-in channel sales and off-premise is significant with the U.S. and international seeing roughly 7-point and 6-point differentials between the 2 channels, respectively. In order to enhance the assets we view as the future of the brand, we are leveraging best practices from our strongest markets to provide targeted compelling options in our off-premise-focused asset options. 
Last but not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 3%. Encouragingly, the U.S. same-store sales grew a healthy 5%, though Taco Bell International caused the division to round down to 4%. 
Starting with the U.S. We began the quarter by showcasing $1 and $5 value and finished the quarter with innovation. Taco Bell continued to double down on value in the U.S. with the $1 Grande Burritos and the Double Cheesy Gordita Crunch box. Our famous Nacho Fries came back for -- again, for a limited time and were so popular that yet again, 1 in 4 orders contained fries. 
We then finished the quarter off strong by introducing a new limited-time offering: Steak Rattlesnake Fries, our signature seasoned fries with marinated steak kicked up with a bit of creamy jalapeño sauce. Of course, Nacho Fries are cool to eat but they're also awesomely spicy. 
The official launch of Taco Bell delivery has been very encouraging. Having launched with marketing support in February, franchisees are all-in on this major initiative and are very excited about delivery as an opportunity to drive incremental sales and transactions. Given it's early days, we aren't going to provide specific data, but I will say that both traffic and check saw benefits from the launch. 
Customers are also loving the new way to get their favorite Taco Bell products. Feedback has been positive, plus the strength of our partnership with Grubhub has allowed for real-time feedback and learnings to continue to elevate the customer experience to even higher levels. Delivery is now live in over 4,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S., and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available on all tacobell.com and Taco Bell app while we're also testing this functionality through Grubhub. 
For Taco Bell International, there's a lot to be excited about. We expanded into the first new market of 2019 with the launch of Taco Bell Thailand where we hosted a launch party that generated nearly 0.5 billion impressions. 
Borrowing from the U.S., we introduced value boxes around the world, which drove growth in the U.K., India and Japan. The U.K. opened its fifth restaurant in Central London and the GBP 5 Stacker Box was a success. India maintained momentum with positive same-store sales driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box. And Taco Bell's dedication to their purpose to feed people's lives with más is shining through, and we are proud of the team and our franchise partners who worked hard to bring this iconic brand to life. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, our 2 most important assets are our brands and our people. For us, Unrivaled Culture & Talent is a true competitive advantage, and we'll continue to focus on it to fuel results and accelerate growth. 
In the 140 markets where we operate, it's our 2,000 franchisees and their employees who are delivering the customer experience at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. In fact, recently in Europe, David and I launched our next-generation leadership development course for franchisees and employees called Inspiring Culture to Fuel Results. This is a program focused on building up our people to lead in a way that makes our 3 iconic brands Relevant, Easy and Distinctive from the inside out. Because of the investment we continue to make in Unrivaled Culture & Talent, we're seeing a strong progress and results on the transformation and setting a healthy foundation for sustainable growth. 
In conclusion, I'm excited about the work we're doing with world-class leaders focusing on our 4 key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!. We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. To begin, our f",1796,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives and 2 of our 4 growth drivers, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. 
To begin, our first quarter results. Consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth increased 12%. And as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 5% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 9% system sales growth in the quarter. 
It's great to see KFC off with such a strong start under new CEO, Tony Lowings. They're leaning in on same-store sales growth on top of what is already a development machine. Contributions to the KFC strength this quarter were broad-based. Japan, Indonesia and Africa, which together represent 9% of KFC's system sales, performed particularly well. Easier laps at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another solid quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% same-store sales growth, including 5% in the U.S. 
As a reminder, our first quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, thereby having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. 
Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 5% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook. As it pertains specifically to 2019, our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of 3 factors: first, the roll-off of special media spending in 2018 related to the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement; second, the roll-off of the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC U.K. business, as we just discussed. 
I'll now update you on our EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus the adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items and any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
We estimated the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements remains a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. 
First quarter 2019 special items are a $0.01 tailwind and first quarter Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.05 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.7% of system sales in the first quarter, and this remains the appropriate target for 2019. As for CapEx, at our Investor Day, we discussed it in 3 buckets: run rate CapEx, targeted new equity units to spur additional growth that we would fund through refranchising a comparable number of units and potential strategic investments outside of the run rate that would create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees. 
I'd now like to elaborate on our thinking for 2019, including 2 positive updates. First, given strong returns on new equity builds, we see attractive opportunities to increase equity unit development to spur additional growth and generate excess returns. Again, these incremental units will be funded by a corresponding increase in the number of units refranchised, so our overall equity unit count remains unchanged. 
Second, we are now even more convinced there are attractive opportunities to lean in on strategic investments to generate faster growth and incremental value, particularly as it pertains to technology. Importantly, much of this strategic spend is being or will be reimbursed by our franchise partners for services related to technology. 
Now of course, these initiatives will drive gross CapEx higher near term, and we now estimate our gross CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $225 million, inclusive of base CapEx, new equity builds and strategic investments in tech projects. However, on a net basis, meaning gross CapEx net of refranchising proceeds, we estimate closer to $125 million or only slightly higher than we previously discussed. Please note, 2019 does include a small incremental benefit from timing as we collect certain trailing proceeds related to our previous refranchising initiatives. 
One consequence of this outlook is that CapEx may exceed depreciation and amortization over the next few years, which could push our free cash flow conversion below 100%, dependent on the absolute level of spend in a given year. To be clear, we're excited by recent returns on investments beyond our base CapEx and believe that through a measured approach, we can enhanced growth and value creation for both our franchise partners and shareholders. 
As for capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $106 million at an average price of $94. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.4 billion in over 2 years of this program. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell as I recently had the opportunity to attend the 2019 franchise owners' forum, where franchisees from all over the U.S. shared their enthusiasm for the brand. I'm truly impressed by the positive spirit and growth mindset of all these franchise partners. 
In regards to operating initiatives, their fast and friendly obsession is all about world-class service to our customers, not simply speed and efficiency. This is exactly why initiatives like this are so powerful. It's because of efforts like this by our franchise partners, restaurant managers and employees that customer satisfaction and friendliness increased by 2 points year-over-year. 
Lastly, during the quarter, each of our service measures improved with the highlight being transaction times dropping 9 seconds from the previous year. 
At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our Hot, Fast and Reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've improved our percentage of orders delivered in under 30 minutes by 3 percentage points year-over-year. 
At Pizza Hut International, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners. As a result, overall customer satisfaction scores have improved in these markets, which include India, France, Indonesia and Australia. Each increased their overall customer satisfaction score by 5% or more. 
KFC continues to drive taste as a key differentiator for the brand with a focus on elevating the role of the cook. This year, we are hosting Taste Talks across the globe to ensure finger lickin' good quality in every bite. We have seen improvement across the board on sharing proven ideas and global best practices, such as Open Kitchen tours and Fast Fridays. Each of these examples show how we are leveraging our scale to adopt and share the best ideas. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 310 net new units. This represents a step-up in development from our recent historical rates, keeping us on track for 2019 to be the fourth consecutive year of increasing net new unit openings. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued into 2019 with 265 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continued to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time, we continued to transform our asset base to the American Showman image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,500 American Showman restaurants across the country as 65 remodels were completed in the U.S. during the quarter. 
Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 23 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 4 urban and Cantina asset formats opened, including restaurants in New York and San Diego where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns and outperforming our closest competitors. Internationally, Taco Bell opened 10 net new units in markets such as Japan, Thailand, India and the U.K. 
Lastly, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. The integration is off to a great start with our transition tasks largely complete. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza has worked closely on transferring and integrating Pizza Hut franchisees into their systems. Further, even during the most intense period for integration, Telepizza reported positive net new unit growth and has begun converting Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand. As a reminder, we still anticipate between 100 and 150 units may close over time due to overlap, though minimal of these closures have occurred thus far. 
To summarize, the first quarter was consistent with our expectations, which included easier laps in the first half of the year. We're pleased with the results as they set us up to deliver on our commitments. With 3 category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

Do you expect franchisee to contribute something to that? Or do you expect to get returns from that capital in technology because they're going to pay an incremental fee? And what is the nature -- if you could describe a little bit more just what the nature of those capital -- incremental capital investments are that would be helpful."
365997,604472890,1715254,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Sure, John.

We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day when I presented what -- the $100 million of run rate CapEx and noted that we were contemplating an increase in equity development and also that we were seeing good opportunities to invest further capital to create more shareholder value and improve the strength of our business. That's pretty much how this is playing out. So the original $100 million of run rate capital hasn't really changed. What's changed is our interest in building a little bit more equity units, all of which will be -- the capital for that will all be generated by refranchising a comparable number of units. In fact, the math on that is such that -- and this is why it's such a great shareholder value-enhancing move. We get more money when we sell a store than it cost to build a new store. So we might get on average $2.5 million every time we sell a store, and it costs more like $1.5 million or less to build a new store. 
So we're seeing sort of an arbitrage opportunity there to help spur development in certain parts of the country, particularly with Taco Bell where we do own a decent amount of equity stores. Some of the best examples are in your backyard in New York City, where I was a couple of weeks ago, visiting some of those great new Taco Bells that have opened. Those stores are worth substantially more than what we paid to build them. So we're going to build probably more -- 40, maybe 50 equity stores this year when the original plans were only to build 5 to 10. So that's driving some of the incremental CapEx. 
And then on the other side of the equation, on strategic investments, we're looking at things like the recent acquisition we announced in the fourth quarter of QuikOrder where we bought the e-commerce provider for Pizza Hut, which I can tell you, we're just 1 quarter in, but has worked out incredibly well. I just, actually this past weekend, left the Pizza Hut franchise convention and was talking to some of the Pizza Hut franchisees there about us now owning QuikOrder. And they are really excited about our ability to create enhancements real time on that platform and just having a lot more control over their tech future. 
But on the Pizza Hut platform, for example, there's a significant investment made to purchase that in Q4. It has some follow-on CapEx investment this year because there's some contingency to the purchase price. And then there's capitalized G&A that comes along with making investments in tech companies, so some of that is going to start to show up on our CapEx line. 
The good news is -- as you noted, John, is we are recovering a lot of that -- a lot of our investment through the service fees that franchisees pay for these to access these platforms. Again, our commitment to the franchise community is we're going to give them the best technology at the best price. But you'll see us recover the cost of these platforms, which is why we say this is great for our franchisees, for our customers and for our shareholders. So if you break the $225 million gross down, the excess above the $100 million run rate that we had quoted before, about half of that is due to equity development and half of that is due to technology and strategic investments."

I think it really fundamentally starts with our focus on what we call R.E.D., Relevant, Easy and Distinct. As I travel the world and meet with the KFC teams, they're amazingly focused on making sure the KFC brand is more relevant, it's more easy and more distinct. Now in some markets, we may be good at distinctive and not as good at relevant. In others, we're good at relevant but we're not as good at distinct. But I think the fact that we've got absolute just laser-like focus on making sure that each KFC brand in each country delivers on R.E.D., I think that's certainly helping. 
I think secondly, as I did say in the prepared remarks, I think the value, like a pound of food for $3, which KFC U.S. ran, that may sound like simple communication. It's both distinctive and it's relevant. So I think that's great. The innovation that's happening, we are seeing a lot of great innovation, flavor innovation on existing forms and new form innovation also occurring. And then, Brian, as you rightly say, we've got delivery and click and collect. And equally, in the U.S., we're excited that later this year, we'll obviously do what Taco Bell has just done, which is put marketing muscle and effort behind delivery, which we think will accelerate that. 
So it's -- there's no silver bullet. It is really doing R.E.D. incredibly well, value incredibly well, innovation incredibly well and a growing contribution from delivery. I think all of that is sustainable going forward. And that's why we remain very positive about the KFC brand."

And I guess I'm trying to understand is there a scenario where you're repositioning the estate but it's happening at a time when aggregators are taking away some of the growth that the pizza category has had kind of to itself for so long? 
And then the related question is what are you seeing in terms of the customers on Grub -- who find you through Grub versus the Pizza Hut app? Is it -- I assume a very different customer base, as we've heard from other restaurants. But given that Pizza Hut is so well known for its -- for delivering pizza, I'm just trying to figure out to what extent the Grub orders are incremental."
365997,604472890,1715254,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Sure. Well, as you said, dine-in does lag by about 7 points on the sales growth line between off-premise and on-premise. And so that is obviously a headwind that we continue to have to work with.

And so that is obviously a headwind that we continue to have to work with. I do think the Pizza Hut brand, particularly in the U.S. and internationally, is doing a much better job at the foundations or the fundamentals. As David pointed out in his prepared remarks, temperature is improving, delivery times are getting lower. I think all of that is working. We're sustaining and we've got franchisee support to sustain obviously great value. You saw the $5 Lineup. Adding P'ZONE which is both great innovation and at $5, obviously, I think will continue to help and we will see that play out I think later in the year. 
With regard to your question on aggregators, look, I think it's -- there's obviously a negative impact, but it's hard to measure what the cannibalization effect is of aggregators on Pizza Hut -- on the pizza category. I think what's exciting for us is that we still think there's obviously a huge opportunity for Pizza Hut in the $40 billion pizza delivery business to do better. But at the same time, the non-pizza delivery market in the U.S. is worth about $100 billion. It's growing at 15%, and now we're going to leverage Taco Bell and KFC to take advantage of that opportunity. So yes, a little bit of negative impact, but I see this whole opportunity of growth in delivery to be an upside for us, not a negative. 
And as we've only got about 200 stores at the moment which are actually going through the Grubhub marketplace, it's not having a massive impact on our business. But I think the point you made is we are excited by the incremental customers we're seeing come through that marketplace. But obviously, the vast majority of the business is still coming through our Pizza Hut traditional business."
365997,604472890,1715254,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

I mean -- and on the Grubhub pizza, I think we are encouraged that there are different customers on Grubhub versus many of the customers that use Pizza Hut directly. So we are accessing customers through their platform in some -- many cases that we wouldn't be able to access. That's why we're excited about the test. 
Back to the other part of your question, Sara, on the dine-in estate. Yes, Pizza Hut in the U.S. is -- the vast majority of our business comes through the delivery/carryout channels. But still, close to half the assets are dine-in assets, and there is still a long process to take those assets, often which are in the wrong part of the trade area, and reposition them to the right part of the trade area or if they are in the right part of the trade area, oftentimes upgrading the asset to modern standards. 
So the challenges of the dine-in estate are very different internationally versus the U.S. In the U.S., we already have -- 90% of our business is off-premise, but the assets are still a problem. Internationally, half of the assets are dine-in, and the business has more of a 50-50 split to it. So very healthy assets in most cases around the world though. 
Before we move on to the next question, I just want to correct a comment from the prepared remarks that some of you probably caught. There was a typo. As far as the 2018 impact from the KFC U.K. supply disruption to Yum!, that impact was 1% on core operating profit in the second quarter, not the 5% that was stated. So I just want to make sure we all have the right number there."

Look, obviously, the U.S. economy is in pretty good shape. We all saw the GDP numbers for Q1 from the government. Look, I also do think, though, there is some sort of bifurcation going on in the marketplace, which is there are certainly people that are making a lot of money and there are certainly people where value will always remain incredibly important. And so I think that our focus on, as we said earlier, building this Relevant, Easy and Distinct, part of being relevant is to make sure we've got the right value proposition for every customer we've got in the marketplace. So we're going to focus on value. We're going to focus on innovation. We're going to focus on delivery and click and collect, as we've talked about. 
And it really is -- sort of part, I guess, of your second question, which is the ability for us to sustain value on all 3 brands is predicated on our ability to get franchisee alignment. And I think what David and I are fundamentally focused on is making sure that at the core, franchise unit-level economics are getting better. And as they get better, then obviously franchisees will hang in on value, they will invest in new assets, refurbishing assets, they will support innovation. 
And so yes, I think the economy is in pretty good shape in the U.S. There are people who are benefiting, people who are not benefiting. We are going to stay on value. We are going to stay on innovation. We are going to stay on building these Relevant, Easy and Distinct brands. And I am really excited that the brands have worked incredibly hard with their franchise partners to ensure that we can sustain this sort of what I call really strong model going forward."

Then on the second question on the KFC global development, I mean, we've been consistent in saying our goal is to ramp up the pace of development. We're pleased with the progress we've made. Obviously, Q1 in recent history was a record quarter for us in terms of net new units. And I do think the development momentum is widespread and will continue. We are confident that we can hit new highs this year versus last year. It isn't really sort of a timing issue. There's a good pipeline of deals for this year and for future years.

We're pleased to report another strong quarter with system sales growth of 10%, including 5% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continues to fuel these results. 
As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of our 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our relevant, easy and distinctive brands or R.E.D. for short as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some additional and exciting news on talent. 
I'll begin with our 3 R.E.D. brands. I'm thrilled to report that KFC delivered its 16th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. Encouragingly, this global powerhouse is seeing broad-based strength across the world with stand up performances across many of our largest markets, which translated into a truly impressive global system sales growth of 10% with same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 6% each. 
Now many of you have been asking, what's fueling the recent broad-based performance? Well, there are a number of factors, including the consumer is healthy. KFC has a robust digital and delivery strategy globally with over 12,000 restaurants delivering on just 1 metric. 
And broadly speaking, at Yum!, our focus on being a world-class franchisor has led us becoming more intentional about fostering collaboration and leveraging the power of Yum!. A perfect example of this is the KFC annual market planning meeting, which is one of the first global collaboration meetings we instituted and which continues to gain momentum and impact each year. 
In fact, our recent 2019 KFC MPM had a record number of franchisees and team members in attendance. We also attended the Pizza Hut MPM earlier this week, and I was impressed how Vipul Chawla and the teams are so focused on the things that matter most. But again, MPMs are just 1 example of fostering collaboration to drive results today and into the future. 
Without question, these forms of collaboration are a unique, competitive advantage for all our franchise partners and team members globally.
Now back to KFC's quarter. Internationally, sales callouts include Japan, Africa, Iberia, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, China, Latin America and the Caribbean. You'll notice I included more markets than usual. But again, strength was broad-based with 8 out of 13 markets reporting at or above 6% same-store sales growth. 
And while each market is unique, the recipe for success has a consistent theme: its disruptive value coupled with amplified innovation compounded by an effective digital and delivery strategy. Specifically, Japan and Africa led the way, each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 18% same-store sales growth was driven by renewed focus on value and a well-received Chicken Pack and Perry Perry chicken innovation. 
Africa's 10% same-store sales growth was backed by the Lobster Lunchbox value promotion and the innovative Crunch Double Down. Iberia's 11% same-store sales growth was driven by continued momentum from strong media campaigns and our third-party delivery partners.
Now to KFC U.S. where same-store sales grew 2% in the quarter. Continued focus on the core menu items was balanced with an accelerated pace of promotions. The quarter began with innovation, first bringing back the very successful chicken and waffles and then introducing Cinnabon biscuits. Value also remained a focus through launching a new channel for a la carte menu items, our 2 for $6 mix-and-match. 
Combined, our new value proposition growth transactions for the quarter allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. KFC continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivering and click and collect throughout this year. And also expect to launch a branded web experience by year-end. 
We now have 2,300 KFCs offering delivery and 3,500 restaurants available for click and collect. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth of our franchisees, and we look forward to updating you more throughout the year.
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 2% and flat unit growth. We're happy to report that transactions for the quarter grew 3%, which is the result of continued compelling value, ops execution and our growing loyalty program, Hut Rewards. 
As you may have seen earlier this week, in partnership with our franchisees, we've updated the $5 lineup to the $5 and up line up where we will continue to offer the same favorites at more flexible price points. We expect this to be a win for franchisees by addressing local economic factors, particularly in high wage markets. While customers benefit from the balance of compelling everyday value and unique only from Pizza Hut innovation. 
While we're pleased with the positive transaction growth this quarter, we understand more clearly than ever that same-store sales growth in the U.S. will continue to be choppy without transforming the asset base. And following the tremendous recent improvements in operations and technology led by Artie Starrs and the Pizza Hut leadership team, we plan to lean in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. estate to a more modern delivery and carryout-focused asset base. This will ultimately position the Pizza Hut brand for many years of faster growth in the U.S. 
We are excited about collaborating with franchisees who are capable, well capitalized, committed to the brand and have a growth mindset to accelerate the closure of underperforming dine-in stores and replacement with new delivery or fast casual delivery assets. 
By the same token, we also know we'll need to directly address franchisees who are burdened with too much debt, don't have access to capital or aren't committed to the long-term. Thus, in a few cases, some of these businesses will need to be restructured in the near term to address capital structure and leverage issues, particularly those franchisees with greater dine-in exposure. 
We view this as a positive move for the brand and David will provide more specifics in a few minutes.
Before moving on to Pizza Hut International, I want to briefly update you on our excitement regarding our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage it as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. 
As a reminder, while customers are placing the orders on the Grubhub app or website, Pizza Hut drivers are completing the delivery to ensure a Hot, Fast and Reliable experience. We ended the second quarter with over 300 locations on Grubhub and are planning on expanding the tests further in the third quarter. 
While it's still early days, we found that the Grubhub customers are incremental and some customers are, therefore, trying our products for the first time. Pizza Hut International system sales grew 15% in the quarter driven by a 10-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 2%. 
We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like China, Europe, Brazil, Indonesia and Hong Kong. I recently visited Latin America and got to see some of our newly converted Telepizza units. I'm so impressed with the team and how they are executing at a high level to drive tremendous early results.
Internationally, the same-store sales gap between the dining channel and off-premise sales was approximately 3 points this quarter. Encouragingly, the smaller gap arose from an improvement in our international diner business as our 2 largest dining markets, China and the U.K., performed well. 
Pizza Hut continues to develop tailored action plans for our largest dine-in markets while at the same time transforming the estate for a more compelling off-premise-focused asset strategy. 
And last but definitely not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 10%, with same-store sales growth of 7% and net new unit growth of 3%. Taco Bell has now reported positive same-store sales growth and 17 of the last 18 quarters, including 12 consecutively. So kudos to the entire team for such amazing results. 
Starting with the U.S., we continue to have a focus on both value and innovation, starting Q2 with a $1 loaded nacho taco followed by the $5 grande nacho box and the return of Nacho Fries. The Grande Nacho Box was a particular stand out as demand was extremely high. A truly amended value at just $5 with sales mix peaking at 10%. 
We also welcome back Nacho Fries for our fourth movie trailer breaking weekly sales records twice during the promotion. The buzzword at the moment of the quarter was the announcement of the Bell Hotel in June. Reservations for a Taco Bell-inspired stadium in Palm Springs sold out in 2 minutes. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 4,900 restaurants and expects to have the full U.S. rollout completed this year. Deliveries now live in 4,500 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. 
The customer experience has been positive with the #1 reason for getting Taco Bell delivered being the craving for the food. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 11 million registered users. 
Additionally, click and collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app. Taco Bell International saw strong sales momentum around the world driven by the focus on cult icons, value boxes at power price points and product innovation. Our value boxes introduced earlier this year continue to drive growth in India, the U.K. and Spain. 
India's same-store sales growth was driven by the launch of their Big Box and Queso Lupa. We continue to build global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions, for example, Canada participated in the steal a game, steal a taco NBA Finals promotions for the first and saw a fantastic results. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, we have 2 important assets, our brands and our people. We feel great about the level of talent we have and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. 
As we've mentioned on previous calls, we made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive environment advantage by investing in a new world-class talent. 
I'd like to start with a unenthusiastic thank you to David Gibbs for his incredible leadership as President and CFO over the last 3 years. He was a great partner to me as we spun off Yum China and adopted our financial and business strategy to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, all with accelerated growth. 
To the beginning of the year, he's worn 3 hats, adding the Chief Operating Officer to his responsibilities and leading the brands to impressive results while we undertook a search for a new CFO. 
And with that, I'm excited to have Chris Turner join the Yum! family as Chief Financial Officer. Chris will begin reporting to him after the filing of our 10-Q on August 8 and will assume global responsibility for finance, corporate strategy, supply chain and information technology. 
From his time at PepsiCo through his years at McKinsey & Company, Chris is a broad thinking business leader who brings nearly 20 years of strategy, finance and operations experience. His deep commercial experience in the quick service and retail sectors, a track record of growth leadership and commitment to culture and talent development make him a perfect fit for the CFO role. 
He's also deeply knowledgeable about digital and technology solutions shaping the future of retail, which will be valuable to Yum! given the role technology will play as we leverage our scale to improve franchise unit economics and accelerate same-store sales growth and net new unit growth. 
We've also finalized our roles for our brand CEOs as David will discuss in more details in a few minutes. And finally, we take our role as a global citizen and our impact on society and the environment very seriously. 
We've recently updated our Recipe for Good, which outlines our public commitments concerning food, planet and people. We've made tremendous progress over the past year when it comes to advancing our citizenship and sustainability agenda to drive socially responsible growth and manage risk better. 
From working to remove antibiotics in our protein supply chain to expanding our station commitments to progressing our work around diversity and inclusion. I truly believe we are leveraging our scale to help address major global issues. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Tale",2160,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
To begin, our second quarter results. Core operating profit growth increased 18% and as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 10%, same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 6% growth in both same-store sales growth and net new unit growth driving 10% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Contribution to the KFC strength were again broad-based. Japan and Africa, which together represent 8% of KFC's system sales, performed particularly well while easier laps at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another tremendous quarter with 10% system sales growth driven by 7% same-store sales growth. 
Our second quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated the 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, therefore, having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. 
Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the quarter -- for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 1% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. Again, now that we have lap the disruption, there will be no benefit from easier laps going forward. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 target excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. 
We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 on the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of the FX rate movements is now an $0.08 headwind to the $3.75 number. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. 
Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.01 headwind and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.01 tailwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018, and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the second quarter while 1.7% of system sales remains the appropriate target for full year 2019. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged from last quarter. 
Our ex-special items effective tax rate for the quarter 23.7%, which is above the 20% to 22% range we gave at our Analyst Day last December, but follows a 12.2% rate in the first quarter. We are not changing our annual tax rate guidance at this time, but we wanted to mention that it is difficult to forecast this rate with pinpoint accuracy in the near term given uncertainty of equity compensation payouts as well as a continually changing tax landscape across the over 145 countries where our system sales are generated. We will continue to update you as we progress through the back half of the year. 
As for our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $196 million at an average price per share of $104. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.7 billion to date. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell. Its fast and friendly obsession helped our system and speed break records in sales this quarter. In fact, in the U.S., 6 million more cars drove through drive-through compared to 2Q 2018 and our guests received an experience that was on average 7 seconds faster. 
This attention to improved speed, customer satisfaction and running great restaurants help the Taco Bell system break 2 weekly sales records just 1 week apart. Internationally, it was my pleasure to visit Italy and Romania where we spent time with our reigning KFC franchisee of the year, Sforza, as fantastic partner to us in both our KFC and Pizza Hut businesses, who recently launched Taco Bell in Bucharest with encouraging early results. 
At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our Hot, Fast and Reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've also perfected the original Pan Pizza, which is now baked in a newly engineered pan. The use of this new pan results in enhanced flavor, texture and improved customer feedback scores for this iconic fan favorite. 
Internationally, we're continuing to run workshops on speed to taste with franchisee partners leading to overall customer satisfaction score improvements in markets, including Malaysia, Kuwait and UAE. 
Pizza Hut digital ventures also expanded its fast casual digital store platform, or FCDS, to Japan and Mexico in 400 and 250 stores, respectively, bringing the total store count to over 2,500. 
Markets with FCDS are similar technology, which also include India, France, Turkey and Malaysia have seen increased online transactions as a result. 
At KFC, Greg and I had the pleasure of attending a global operations meeting in Dallas in June, which had operators from around the world in attendance, along with both KFC and franchisee leaders represented. The key focus was aligning on strategy when it comes to empowering frontline leaders of our business, our restaurant general managers. Topics were broad and included ideal equipment design and set up as well as technology options to make life easier for our team members. 
We were impressed and inspired by the passion of our operators have from improving the customer and team member experiences. It was a great example of how collaboration can lead to best-in-class solutions for our businesses across the globe. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 312 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,897, excluding the Telepizza units added in 4Q of last year. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued with 232 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia, Thailand, Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time transforming our asset base to the American showman image. We close out the quarter with over 1,600 American Showman restaurants across the country as 104 remodels was completed. 
Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 18 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 2 urban Cantina restaurants opened in Manhattan where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns. With 46 urban Cantina restaurants across the Taco Bell system at the end of the quarter, they represent a strong complement to our existing asset portfolio and will remain an important part of future development. 
Internationally, Taco Bell opened 13 net new units in 11 countries and signed master franchise agreements in India and Portugal. In particular, I'm very excited to highlight India and our partnership with Burman Hospitality. This is our largest Taco Bell development agreement today with plans for 600 Taco Bell restaurants over the next 10 years, which would make Burman Hospitality the largest Taco Bell franchisee globally. 
We are confident in a long runway for growth for Taco Bell International and continue to garner interest from 3C partners around the globe. At Pizza Hut, as Greg mentioned earlier, we are leaning in to accelerate the transaction for Pizza Hut U.S. asset base to truly modern delivery/carryout assets. This will ultimately strengthen the Pizza Hut business in the U.S. and set it up for a faster long-term growth. 
During this transition, we expect a temporary deceleration in the pace of new-unit development for the Pizza Hut Division as continued healthy international unit growth will be partially offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. 
As a result, our U.S. store count could drop to a as low 7,000 locations over the next 24 months, primarily driven by closures of underperforming dine-in restaurants before rebounding to current levels and above in the future. 
Further, we believe that Yum! will still deliver 4% annual net new unit growth on average over the next several years. Although as mentioned, it will be probably a little bumpier than our original plans. Importantly, the short-term financial impact should be minimal as the closures will be our lower volume stores and long-term should improve our system sales and profitability as a closed units are replaced with higher volume stores.
Outside the U.S., Pizza Hut celebrated its 11,000 international restaurant opening alongside its franchise partner, Americana, located at the waterfront development of Dubai Creek Harbour, this brand-new fast casual delivery store is a great example of a truly modern asset resonating with customers and driving profitable unit development. 
As for our strategic alliance -- our growth -- strategic growth alliance with Telepizza, the integration continues to go very well. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza again reported positive net new unit growth and conversions of Telepizza units for the Pizza Hut brand.
Next, Unrivaled Culture & Talent. The Board of Directors, Greg and I are excited to have finalized our roles for our brand CEOs. First, Mark King, former President of Adidas Group North America, will join the company as Taco Bell Division Chief Executive Officer reporting to me effective August 5. Mark brings to Taco Bell and Yum! extensive retail experience and an excellent track record driving growth, innovation, brand relevance and culture. This unique talents of rewriting the rules for brands to win in fiercely competitive markets will be central to Taco Bell's journey to become a $15 billion brand that transcends the quick service restaurant and retail categories. 
We are privileged to be in a position to add Mark's high-caliber talent to the strong and accomplished Taco Bell leadership team we have in place. Under the leadership of Julie Felss Masino, Taco Bell North American President; and Liz Williams, Taco Bell International President, the Taco Bell team has been delivering fantastic results and has reinforced Taco Bell's stronghold as the Category of One brand in the U.S. and internationally. Both Julie and Liz will report to Mark going forward. 
Second, Artie Starrs, President of Pizza Hut U.S., has been promoted to Pizza Hut Division Chief Executive Officer. Artie is a talented growth leader has made bold moves to galvanize Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees around the Transformation Agreement, strengthen the brand, digital and e-commerce road map, improve operations and the customer experience and articulate a clear path forward to drive Pizza Hut's growth over the long-term. I'm confident Artie will help grow and continue to strengthen Pizza Hut's competitive position globally in partnership with Vipul Chawla, President of Pizza Hut International, who was off to a truly fantastic start and now reporting to Artie.
Third, and rounding out the brand CEOs, I'm pleased to report KFC Division Chief Executive Officer Tony Lowings had had an incredible start. Under Toni's leadership, the global KFC system has accelerated beyond what were highly accomplish world-class results across the board. 
In summary, the first half of 2019 was a strong start to the year. We always expected a stronger first half owing to less challenging lapse than the second half but this quarter's results exceeded our already high expectations. With 3 category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology and delivery. 
We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

We talked a lot about global scale, I just wanted to get how you view your current franchise community and one thing that we have seen is a fairly common theme is consolidating franchisees around the world allowing franchisees themselves to have scale from every different perspective. 
How much more of that do you think should occur within the overall Yum! system? Is there still an opportunity from here to accelerate unit growth? And I'd like to add just because there is an undercurrent that's discussed about this is how you're monitoring the leverage that the franchisees are taking, giving you confidence that they can continue or maintain their development even when the cycle eventually comes to an end."

As you know, our franchise base tends to have the larger typical franchisee has about 25 stores. It's a lot bigger than most in the industry. And there are pockets around the world where we would be encouraging consolidation where we do have a more fragmented base in the country. But in general, we like the model of having bigger, better capitalized, more capable franchisees. We view that as a competitive advantage that we have really professionally around organizations helping us to build our brand. But I don't think we have some -- to answer your question, I don't think we have some big strategy to consolidate. We already have a pretty large number of stores per franchisee. 
And then as far as monitoring leverage obviously, as part of being a world-class franchisor, we're putting the brands in the hands of our franchisees, and we need to make sure that they are all in the best financial health and most capable to grow the brands. That's a big part of what we do working with franchisees to make sure they have the right kind of financial structure to succeed. And with 2,000 franchisees, there will be always be situations that we have to attend to. But in general, around the world, across the 3 brands, we feel like our franchises are generally in good health.
I think they're also very engage in the business right now. They've been -- we have record attendance of the franchisees at the recent 3-brand MPM so that's really good to see when they come in and want to understand why the brand is performing well, what we're doing on a global basis so we can share best-practice. So I'm very encouraged by I guess their energy and their commitment to growing our 3 iconic global brands."

Obviously, as you said, Pizza Hut U.S. trends were up 3, international trends were up 1. Taco Bell trans are up 3 and our global KFC trans were also up 3. So it was a strong quarter for the transaction point of view. I do think at the same time, value even though that customer is in a healthy position, value remains a priority and making sure that we don't walk away from both every day and disruptive value. So it's about finding that fine line between every day and disruptive value and obviously driving transactions. 
On the aggregator front, I think what we're clearly learning is that there are people that are loyal to the Pizza Hut, there are people that are loyal to Grubhub, in our case. The way to grow our business is to increase reach and penetration and our ability I think to partner with both Grubhub and also -- as a party at sort of Pizza Hut brand enables is just to get broader reach.

I think we have until the end of the quarter 7,449 Pizza Hut assets in the U.S. Just a clarifying comment on that, 6,100 of those are traditional restaurants and about 1,350 are express units. I know sometimes as we calculate percentages of dine-in and stock, you could use either base. But within our traditional base of 6,100, close to half are dine-in as obviously as part of the 7,449 is a smaller percentage. 
But as far as the numbers and how the math works, it's hard to estimate how soon the timing of when a store will close and then when the replaced unit will open. There will be gaps and some of those and certainly. Our goal is to try to minimize those gaps. So it's a little hard to pinpoint an exact number but -- and that's why we provided that guidance at the store count at any point in time over the next few years could dip down close to that 7,000. But we ultimately -- we know that the economics of building a modern delivery assets were quite well for us and that any -- for the most part, any area, trade area where a store closes, there should be the opportunity to rebuild the store in that area or somewhere nearby. 
As far as the capital required to do this, we are committed to the asset-light model, [indiscernible] 98% franchise, and we think the economics of building a new unit stand on their own. And we should have no trouble getting either existing or new franchisees ultimately to rebuild in these trade areas. But as we get into the specific situations and sort them out, there may be some situations where we deploy a little capital in the short-term to flip a market and get it into the hands of somebody else and take our capital back out.

We know exactly what drives both reach and frequency, and I -- what I'm really excited is that he and Catherine, the CMO, has pivoted the brands to really helping us drive reach. So I think that's also the reason why the transaction was so strong at the quarter at plus 3% internationally, which is really high for that same-store sales growth.

So I think they're doing very well. The calendar for the balance of the year looks strong. Obviously, we start to roll over some pretty big numbers.

We're pleased to report another strong quarter with system sales growth of 10%, including 5% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continues to fuel these results. 
As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of our 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or R.E.D. for short, as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some additional and exciting news on talent. 
I'll begin with our 3 R.E.D. brands. I'm thrilled to report that KFC delivered its 16th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. Encouragingly, this global powerhouse is seeing broad-based strength across the world with standout performances across many of our largest markets, which translated into a truly impressive global system sales growth of 10% with same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 6% each. 
Now many of you have been asking, ""What's fueling the recent broad-based performance?"" Well, there are a number of factors, including the consumer is healthy. KFC has a robust digital and delivery strategy globally with over 12,000 restaurants delivering on just 1 metric. And broadly speaking, at Yum!, our focus on being a world-class franchisor has led us -- becoming more intentional about fostering collaboration and leveraging the power of Yum!. 
A perfect example of this is the KFC annual market planning meeting, which is one of the first global collaboration meetings we instituted and which continues to gain momentum and impact each year. In fact, our recent 2019 KFC MPM had a record number of franchisees and team members in attendance. We also attended the Pizza Hut MPM earlier this week, and I was impressed with how Vipul Chawla and the teams are so focused on the things that matter most. But again, MPMs are just 1 example of fostering collaboration to drive results today and into the future. Without question, these forms of collaboration are a unique competitive advantage for all our franchise partners and team members globally.
Now back to KFC's quarter. Internationally, sales callouts include: Japan, Africa, Iberia, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, China, Latin America and the Caribbean. You'll notice I included more markets than usual. But again, strength was broad-based with 8 out of 13 markets reporting at or above 6% same-store sales growth. And while each market is unique, the recipe for success has a consistent theme: Its disruptive value, coupled with amplified innovation, compounded by an effective digital and delivery strategy. 
Specifically, Japan and Africa led the way, each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 18% same-store sales growth was driven by renewed focus on value and a well-received Chicken Pack and Pari-Pari chicken innovation. Africa's 10% same-store sales growth was backed by the Wrapsta Lunchbox value promotion and the innovative Crunch Double Down. Iberia's 11% same-store sales growth was driven by continued momentum from strong media campaigns and our third-party delivery partners.
Now to KFC U.S., where same-store sales grew 2% in the quarter. Continued focus on the core menu items was balanced with an accelerated pace of promotions. The quarter began with innovation, first bringing back the very successful Chicken & Waffles and then introducing Cinnabon Biscuits. Value also remained a focus through launching a new channel for a la carte menu items, our 2 for $6 Mix and Match. Combined, our new value proposition drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. 
KFC continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivering and click-and-collect throughout this year and also expects to launch a branded web experience by year-end. We now have 2,300 KFCs offering delivery and 3,500 restaurants available for click and collect. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees, and we look forward to updating you more throughout the year.
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 2% and flat unit growth. We're happy to report that transactions for the quarter grew 3%, which is the result of continued compelling value, ops execution and our growing loyalty program, Hut Rewards. 
As you may have seen earlier this week, in partnership with our franchisees, we've updated the $5 Lineup to the $5 'N-Up Lineup, where we will continue to offer the same favorites at more flexible price points. We expect this to be a win for franchisees by addressing local economic factors, particularly in high-wage markets, while customers benefit from the balance of compelling everyday value and unique only-from-Pizza Hut innovation. 
While we're pleased with the positive transaction growth this quarter, we understand more clearly than ever that same-store sales growth in the U.S. will continue to be choppy without transforming the asset base. And following the tremendous recent improvements in operations and technology led by Artie Starrs and the Pizza Hut leadership team, we plan to lean in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. estate to a more modern delivery and carryout-focused asset base. This will ultimately position the Pizza Hut brand for many years of faster growth in the U.S. 
We are excited about collaborating with franchisees who are capable, well capitalized, committed to the brand and who have a growth mindset to accelerate the closure of underperforming dine-in stores and replacement with new delivery or fast casual delivery assets. 
By the same token, we also know we'll need to directly address franchisees who are burdened with too much debt, don't have access to capital or aren't committed to the long term. Thus, in a few cases, some of these businesses will need to be restructured in the near term to address capital structure and leverage issues, particularly those franchisees with greater dine-in exposure. We view this as a positive move for the brand and David will provide more specifics in a few minutes.
Before moving on to Pizza Hut International, I want to briefly update you on our excitement regarding our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage it as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. As a reminder, while customers are placing the orders on the Grubhub app or website, Pizza Hut drivers are completing the delivery to ensure our Hot, Fast and Reliable experience. We ended the second quarter with over 300 locations on Grubhub and are planning on expanding the test further in the third quarter. While it's still early days, we found that the Grubhub customers are incremental and some customers are, therefore, trying our craveable products for the first time. 
Pizza Hut International's system sales grew 15% in the quarter driven by a 10-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 2%. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like China, Europe, Brazil, Indonesia and Hong Kong. I recently visited Latin America and got to see some of our newly converted Telepizza units. I'm so impressed with the team and how they are executing at a high level to drive tremendous early results.
Internationally, the same-store sales gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales was approximately 3 points this quarter. Encouragingly, the smaller gap arose from an improvement in our international dine-in business as our 2 largest dine-in markets, China and the U.K., performed well. Pizza Hut continues to develop tailored action plans for our largest dine-in markets while at the same time transforming the estate for a more compelling off-premise-focused asset strategy. 
And last but definitely not least, Taco Bell, where system sales grew 10% with same-store sales growth of 7% and net new unit growth of 3%. Taco Bell has now reported positive same-store sales growth in 17 of the last 18 quarters, including 12 consecutively. So kudos to the entire team for such amazing results. 
Starting with the U.S., we continue to have a focus on both value and innovation, starting Q2 with a $1 Loaded Nacho Taco followed by the $5 Grande Nacho Box and the return of Nacho Fries. The Grande Nachos Box was a particular standout as demand was extremely high, a truly abundant value at just $5, with sales mix peaking at 10%. We also welcomed back Nacho Fries for our fourth faux movie trailer, breaking weekly sales records twice during the promotion. 
The buzzworthy moment of the quarter was the announcement of The Bell hotel in June. Reservations for a Taco Bell-inspired stay in Palm Springs sold out in 2 minutes. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 4,900 restaurants and expects to have the full U.S. rollout completed this year. Delivery is now live in 4,500 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S., and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. The customer experience has been positive, with the #1 reason for getting Taco Bell delivered being the craving for the food. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 11 million registered users. Additionally, click and collect functionality is available nationwide on Tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app. 
Taco Bell International saw strong sales momentum around the world driven by the focus on cult icons, value boxes at price -- at power price points and product innovation. Our value boxes introduced earlier this year continued to drive growth in India, the U.K. and Spain. India's positive same-store sales growth was driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box and Quesalupa. 
We continue to build global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. For example, Canada participated in the Steal a Game, Steal a Taco NBA Finals promotion for the first and saw fantastic results. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, we have 2 important assets: Our brands and our people. We feel great about the level of talent we have and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we've made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage by investing in a new -- in new world-class talent. 
I'd like to start with an enthusiastic thank you to David Gibbs for his incredible leadership as President and CFO the last 3 years. He was a great partner to me as we spun off Yum China and adapted our financial and business strategy to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, all with accelerated growth. Since the beginning of the year, he's worn 3 hats, adding the Chief Operating Officer to his responsibilities, and leading the brands to impressive results while we undertook a search for a new CFO. 
And with that, I'm excited to have Chris Turner join the Yum! family as Chief Financial Officer. Chris will begin reporting to me after filing of our 10-Q on August 8 and will assume global responsibility for finance, corporate strategy, supply chain and information technology. From his time at PepsiCo to his years at McKinsey & Company, Chris is a broad-thinking business leader who brings nearly 20 years of strategy, finance and operations experience. His deep commercial experience in the quick service and retail sectors, a track record of growth leadership and commitment to culture and talent development make him a perfect fit for the CFO role. 
He's also deeply knowledgeable about digital and technology solutions shaping the future of retail, which will be invaluable to Yum! given the role technology will play as we leverage our scale to improve franchise unit economics and accelerate same-store sales growth and net new unit growth. We've also finalized our roles for our brand CEOs as David will discuss in more details in a few minutes. 
And finally, we take our role as a global citizen and our impact on society and the environment very seriously. We've recently updated our Recipe for Good, which outlines our public commitments concerning food, planet and people. We've made tremendous progress over the past year when it comes to advancing our citizenship and sustainability agenda to drive socially responsible growth and manage risk better. From working to remove antibiotics in our protein supply chain to expanding our deforestation commitments to progressing our work around diversity and inclusion, I truly believe we are leveraging our scale to help address major global issues. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Tale",2165,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
To begin, our second quarter results. Core operating profit growth increased 18%, and as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 10%, same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 6% growth in both same-store sales growth and net new unit growth driving 10% system sales growth in the quarter. Contribution to the KFC strength were again broad-based. Japan and Africa, which together represent 8% of KFC's system sales, performed particularly well while easier laps at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another tremendous quarter with 10% system sales growth driven by 7% same-store sales growth. 
Our second quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, therefore having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the quarter -- for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 1% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. Again, now that we have lapped the disruption, there will be no benefit from easier laps going forward. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. 
Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 target excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 on the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. 
Our updated estimate of the impact of the FX rate movements is now an $0.08 headwind to the $3.75 number. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.01 headwind and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.01 tailwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. 
Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiative to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018, and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the second quarter while 1.7% of system sales remains the appropriate target for full year 2019. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged from last quarter. 
Our ex-special items effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, which is above the 20% to 22% range we gave at our Analyst Day last December, but follows a 12.2% rate in the first quarter. We are not changing our annual tax rate guidance at this time, but we wanted to mention that it is difficult to forecast this rate with pinpoint accuracy in the near term given uncertainty of equity compensation payouts as well as a continually changing tax landscape across the over 145 countries where our system sales are generated. We will continue to update you as we progress through the back half of the year. 
As for our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $196 million at an average price per share of $104. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.7 billion to date. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell. Its fast and friendly obsession helped our system in speed and break records in sales this quarter. In fact, in the U.S., 6 million more cars drove through drive-thrus compared to 2Q 2018. And our guests received an experience that was on average 7 seconds faster. This attention to improved speed, customer satisfaction and running great restaurants helped the Taco Bell system break 2 weekly sales records just 1 week apart. 
Internationally, it was my pleasure to visit Italy and Romania, where we spent time with our reigning KFC franchisee of the year, Sphera, a fantastic partner to us in both our KFC and Pizza Hut businesses, who recently launched Taco Bell in Bucharest with encouraging early results. 
At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our Hot, Fast and Reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've also perfected the Original Pan Pizza, which is now baked in a newly engineered pan. The use of this new pan results in enhanced flavor, texture and improved customer feedback scores for this iconic fan favorite. 
Internationally, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners leading to overall customer satisfaction score improvements in markets, including Malaysia, Kuwait and UAE. 
Pizza Hut Digital Ventures also expanded its fast casual digital store platform, or FCDS, to Japan and Mexico in 400 and 250 stores, respectively, bringing the total store count to over 2,500. Markets with FCDS or similar technology, which also include India, France, Turkey and Malaysia, have seen increased online transactions as a result. 
At KFC, Greg and I had the pleasure of attending a global operations meeting in Dallas in June which had operators from around the world in attendance, along with both KFC and franchisee leaders represented. The key focus was aligning on strategy when it comes to empowering the frontline leaders of our business, our restaurant general managers. Topics were broad and included ideal equipment design and setup as well as technology options to make life easier for our team members. We were impressed and inspired by the passion of -- our operators have for improving the customer and team member experiences. It was a great example of how collaboration can lead to best-in-class solutions for our businesses across the globe. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 312 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,897, excluding the Telepizza units added in 4Q of last year. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued with 232 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia, Thailand, Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time transforming our asset base to the American Showman image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,600 American Showman restaurants across the country as 104 remodels were completed. 
Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 18 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 2 Urban/Cantina restaurants opened in Manhattan where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns. With 46 Urban/Cantina restaurants across the Taco Bell system at the end of the quarter, they represent a strong complement to our existing asset portfolio and will remain an important part of future development. 
Internationally, Taco Bell opened 13 net new units in 11 countries and signed master franchise agreements in India and Portugal. In particular, I'm very excited to highlight India and our partnership with Burman Hospitality. This is our largest Taco Bell development agreement to date with plans for 600 Taco Bell restaurants over the next 10 years, which would make Burman Hospitality the largest Taco Bell franchisee globally. We are confident in a long runway for growth for Taco Bell International and continue to garner interest from 3 C partners around the globe. 
At Pizza Hut, as Greg mentioned earlier, we are leaning in to accelerate the transaction of our Pizza Hut U.S. asset base to truly modern delivery/carryout assets. This will ultimately strengthen the Pizza Hut business in the U.S. and set it up for a faster long-term growth. During this transition, we expect a temporary deceleration in the pace of new unit development for the Pizza Hut Division as continued healthy international unit growth will be partially offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. 
As a result, our U.S. store count could drop to as low 7,000 locations over the next 24 months, primarily driven by closures of underperforming dine-in restaurants before rebounding to current levels and above in the future. Further, we believe that Yum! will still deliver 4% annual net new unit growth on average over the next several years. Although as mentioned, it will probably be a little bumpier than our original plans. Importantly, the short-term financial impact should be minimal as the closures will be our lower-volume stores, and long-term, this should improve our system sales and profitability as a closed units are replaced with higher-volume stores.
Outside the U.S., Pizza Hut celebrated its 11,000th international restaurant opening alongside its franchise partner, Americana. Located at the waterfront development of Dubai Creek Harbour, this brand-new fast casual delivery store is a great example of a truly modern asset resonating with customers and driving profitable unit development. 
As for our strategic alliance -- our growth -- strategic growth alliance with Telepizza, the integration continues to go very well. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza again reported positive net new unit growth and conversions of Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand.
Next, Unrivaled Culture & Talent. The Board of Directors, Greg and I, are excited to have finalized our roles for our brand CEOs. 
First, Mark King, former President of Adidas Group North America, will join the company as Taco Bell Division Chief Executive Officer, reporting to me effective August 5. Mark brings to Taco Bell and Yum! extensive retail experience and an excellent track record driving growth, innovation, brand relevance and culture. His unique talent of rewriting the rules for brands to win in fiercely competitive markets will be central to Taco Bell's journey to become a $15 billion brand that transcends the quick service restaurant and retail categories. 
We're privileged to be in a position to add Mark's high-caliber talent to the strong and accomplished Taco Bell leadership team we have in place. Under the leadership of Julie Felss Masino, Taco Bell North American President; and Liz Williams, Taco Bell International President, the Taco Bell team has been delivering fantastic results and has reinforced Taco Bell's stronghold as a Category of One brand in the U.S. and internationally. Both Julie and Liz will report to Mark going forward. 
Second, Artie Starrs, President of Pizza Hut U.S., has been promoted to Pizza Hut Division Chief Executive Officer. Artie is a talented growth leader who has made bold moves to galvanize Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees around the Transformation Agreement, strengthen the brand's digital and e-commerce road map, improve operations and the customer experience and articulate a clear path forward to drive Pizza Hut's growth over the long term. I'm confident Artie will help grow and continue to strengthen Pizza Hut's competitive position globally in partnership with Vipul Chawla, President of Pizza Hut International, who is off to a truly fantastic start and now reporting to Artie.
Third, and rounding out the brand CEOs, I'm pleased to report KFC Division Chief Executive Officer Tony Lowings has had an incredible start. Under Tony's leadership, the global KFC system has accelerated beyond what were highly accomplished world-class results across the board. 
In summary, the first half of 2019 was a strong start to the year. We always expected a stronger first half owing to less challenging laps than the second half, but this quarter's results exceeded our already high expectations. 
With 3 category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

I mean, we've talked a lot about global scale and I just wanted to get a sense of how you view your current franchise community.

We view that as a competitive advantage, that we have really professionally run organizations helping us to build our brand. But I don't think we have some -- to answer your question, I don't think we have some big strategy to consolidate. We already have a pretty large number of stores per franchisee. 
And then as far as monitoring leverage. Obviously, as part of being a world-class franchisor, we're putting the brands in the hands of our franchisees and we need to make sure that they are all in the best financial health and most capable to grow the brands. That's a big part of what we do, working with franchisees to make sure they have the right kind of financial structure to succeed.

In other words, maybe you could just talk about the puts and takes to that comp as you think about the shift towards delivery from dine-in and the impact of aggregators, whether it's with competitors or partners. 
And then just a housekeeping. You're going to have an -- you're going to close some stores. I know you said that will have an impact on unit count in U.S. But shouldn't that be a tailwind for same-store sales if those are some of the weaker-performing stores?"

So it's about finding that fine line between every day and disruptive value and obviously driving transactions. 
On the aggregator front, I think what we're clearly learning is that, look, there are people that are loyal to Pizza Hut, there are people that are loyal to Grubhub. In our case, the way to grow our business is to increase reach and penetration. And our ability I think to partner with both Grubhub and also -- as a party to the sort of Pizza Hut brand enables us just to get broader reach.

I think we have, as of the end of the quarter, 7,449 Pizza Hut assets in the U.S. Just a clarifying comment on that. 6,100 of those are traditional restaurants and about 1,350 are express units. I know sometimes as we calculate percentages of dine-in and stuff, you could use either base. But within our traditional base of 6,100, close to half are dine-in, as -- obviously as part of the 7,449, and so it's a smaller percentage. 
But as far as the numbers and how the math works, it's hard to estimate how soon the timing of when a store will close and then when the replaced unit will open. There will be gaps at some -- on some of those, but certainly, our goal is to try to minimize those gaps. So it's a little hard to pinpoint an exact number, but -- and that's why we provided the guidance of the store count at any point in time over the next few years could dip down close to that 7,000. But we ultimately -- we know that the economics of building a modern delivery asset work quite well for us, and that any -- for the most part, any area, trade area where a store closes, there should be the opportunity to rebuild a store in that area or somewhere nearby. 
As far as the capital required to do this, we are committed to the asset-light model, at the 98% franchised. And we think the economics of building a new unit stand on their own. And we should have no trouble getting either existing or new franchisees ultimately to rebuild in these trade areas. But as we get into the specific situations and sort them out, there may be some situations where we deploy a little capital in the short term to flip a market and get it in the hands of somebody else and take our capital back out.

We had probably been focused on driving what we call 1 extra transaction, 1 extra occasion from a frequency point of view.

We know exactly what drives both reach and frequency, and I -- what I'm really excited is that he and Catherine Tan, the CMO, have pivoted the brands to really helping us drive reach. And so I think that's also the reason why the transaction growth was so strong in the quarter at plus 3% internationally, which is really half of our same-store sales growth. 
So -- and at the MPMs last week, which we sat through, I think David and I were so impressed with the consistency of what we saw. People are focusing on a very clear, simple and aligned global brand positioning, they're executing it.

We're not going to really provide guidance by brand on development. And obviously, some of the tailwinds we have going on at KFC from new unit development will help offset a little bit of the challenges that we'll have on unit count at Pizza Hut. Which is why we think when you net it all out over the long term, we'll be able to continue to grow Yum! at that 4% rate on average. As the base keeps getting larger, that means that unit counts will keep going up. But KFC is having widespread success, you can see it in the numbers, system sales growth all across the board, and that leads to better unit economics. And franchisees are putting their money behind those better unit economics and building more stores."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter with system sales growth of 10%, including 5% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continues to fuel these results. 
As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of our 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short, as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some additional and exciting news on talent. 
I'll begin with our 3 R.E.D. brands. I'm thrilled to report that KFC delivered its 16th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. Encouragingly, this global powerhouse is seeing broad-based strength across the world with standout performances across many of our largest markets, which translated into a truly impressive global system sales growth of 10% with same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 6% each. 
Now many of you have been asking, ""What's fueling the recent broad-based performance?"" Well, there are a number of factors, including the consumer is healthy. KFC has a robust digital and delivery strategy globally with over 12,000 restaurants delivering on just one metric. And broadly speaking, at Yum!, our focus on being a world-class franchisor has led us to becoming more intentional about fostering collaboration and leveraging the power of Yum!. 
A perfect example of this is the KFC annual market planning meeting, which is one of the first global collaboration meetings we instituted and which continues to gain momentum and impact each year. In fact, our recent 2019 KFC MPM had a record number of franchisees and team members in attendance. 
We also attended the Pizza Hut MPM earlier this week, and I was impressed with how Vipul Chawla and the teams are so focused on the things that matter most. But again, MPMs are just one example of fostering collaboration to drive results today and into the future. Without question, these forums for collaboration are a unique competitive advantage for all our franchise partners and team members globally.
Now back to KFC's quarter. Internationally, sales callouts include: Japan, Africa, Iberia, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, China, Latin America and the Caribbean. You'll notice I included more markets than usual. But again, strength was broad-based with 8 out of 13 markets reporting at or above 6% same-store sales growth. And while each market is unique, the recipe for success has a consistent theme: it's disruptive value coupled with amplified innovation, compounded by an effective digital and delivery strategy. 
Specifically, Japan and Africa led the way, each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 18% same-store sales growth was driven by renewed focus on value and a well-received chicken pack and Pari-Pari  chicken innovation. Africa's 10% same-store sales growth was backed by the Wrapsta lunchbox value promotion and the innovative Crunch Double Down. Iberia's 11% same-store sales growth was driven by continued momentum from strong media campaigns and our third-party delivery partners.
Now to KFC U.S., where same-store sales grew 2% in the quarter. Continued focus on the core menu items was balanced with an accelerated pace of promotions. The quarter began with innovation, first bringing back the very successful Chicken & Waffles and then introducing Cinnabon Biscuits. Value also remained a focus through launching a new channel for a la carte menu items, our 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match. Combined, our new value proposition drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. 
KFC continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivering and click-and-collect throughout this year and also expects to launch a branded web experience by year-end. We now have 2,300 KFCs offering delivery and 3,500 restaurants available for click-and-collect. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees, and we look forward to updating you more throughout the year.
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 2% and flat unit growth. We're happy to report that transactions for the quarter grew 3%, which is the result of continued compelling value, ops execution and our growing loyalty program, Hut Rewards. 
As you may have seen earlier this week, in partnership with our franchisees, we've updated the $5 Lineup to the $5 ‘N-Up Lineup, where we will continue to offer the same favorites at more flexible price points. We expect this to be a win for franchisees by addressing local economic factors, particularly in high-wage markets, while customers benefit from the balance of compelling everyday value and unique only-from-Pizza Hut innovation. 
While we're pleased with the positive transaction growth this quarter, we understand more clearly than ever that same-store sales growth in the U.S. will continue to be choppy without transforming the asset base. And following the tremendous recent improvements in operations and technology led by Artie Starrs and the Pizza Hut leadership team, we plan to lean in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. estate to a more modern delivery and carryout-focused asset base. This will ultimately position the Pizza Hut brand for many years of faster growth in the U.S. 
We are excited about collaborating with franchisees who are capable, well capitalized, committed to the brand and who have a growth mindset to accelerate the closure of underperforming dine-in stores and replacement with new delivery or fast casual delivery assets. 
By the same token, we also know we'll need to directly address franchisees who are burdened with too much debt, don't have access to capital or aren't committed to the long term. Thus, in a few cases, some of these businesses will need to be restructured in the near term to address capital structure and leverage issues, particularly those franchisees with greater dine-in exposure. We view this as a positive move for the brand and David will provide more specifics in a few minutes.  
Before moving on to Pizza Hut International, I want to briefly update you on our excitement regarding our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage it as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. As a reminder, while customers are placing their orders on the Grubhub app or website, Pizza Hut drivers are completing the delivery to ensure our Hot, Fast and Reliable experience. We ended the second quarter with over 300 locations on Grubhub and are planning on expanding the test further in the third quarter. While it's still early days, we found that the Grubhub customers are incremental and some customers are, therefore, trying our craveable products for the first time. 
Pizza Hut International's system sales grew 15% in the quarter driven by a 10-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 2%. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like China, Europe, Brazil, Indonesia and Hong Kong. I recently visited Latin America and got to see some of our newly converted Telepizza units. I'm so impressed with the team and how they are executing at a high level to drive tremendous early results.
Internationally, the same-store sales gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales was approximately 3 points this quarter. Encouragingly, the smaller gap arose from an improvement in our international dine-in business as our 2 largest dine-in markets, China and the U.K., performed well. Pizza Hut continues to develop tailored action plans for our largest dine-in markets while at the same time transforming the estate for a more compelling off-premise-focused asset strategy. 
And last but definitely not least, Taco Bell, where system sales grew 10% with same-store sales growth of 7% and net new unit growth of 3%. Taco Bell has now reported positive same-store sales growth in 17 of the last 18 quarters, including 12 consecutively. So kudos to the entire team for such amazing results. 
Starting with the U.S. We continue to have a focus on both value and innovation, starting Q2 with a $1 Loaded Nacho Taco followed by the $5 Grande Nacho Box and the return of Nacho Fries. The Grande Nachos Box was a particular standout as demand was extremely high, a truly abundant value at just $5, with sales mix peaking at 10%. We also welcomed back Nacho Fries for our fourth faux movie trailer, breaking weekly sales records twice during the promotion. 
The buzzworthy moment of the quarter was the announcement of The Bell hotel in June. Reservations for a Taco Bell-inspired stay in Palm Springs sold out in 2 minutes. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 4,900 restaurants and expects to have the full U.S. rollout completed this year. Delivery is now live in 4,500 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S., and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. The customer experience has been positive, with the #1 reason for getting Taco Bell delivered being the craving for the food. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 11 million registered users. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app. 
Taco Bell International saw strong sales momentum around the world driven by the focus on cult icons, value boxes at price -- at power price points and product innovation. Our value boxes introduced earlier this year continued to drive growth in India, the U.K. and Spain. India's positive same-store sales growth was driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box and Quesalupa. 
We continue to build global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. For example, Canada participated in the Steal a Game, Steal a Taco NBA Finals promotion for the first time and saw fantastic results. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, we have 2 important assets: our brands and our people. We feel great about the level of talent we have and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we've made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage by investing in a new -- in new world-class talent. 
I'd like to start with an enthusiastic thank you to David Gibbs for his incredible leadership as President and CFO the last 3 years. He was a great partner to me as we spun off Yum China and adapted our financial and business strategy to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, all with accelerated growth. Since the beginning of the year, he's worn 3 hats, adding the Chief Operating Officer to his responsibilities, and leading the brands to impressive results while we undertook a search for a new CFO.  
And with that, I'm excited to have Chris Turner join the Yum! family as Chief Financial Officer. Chris will begin reporting to me after filing of our 10-Q on August 8 and will assume global responsibility for finance, corporate strategy, supply chain and information technology. From his time at PepsiCo to his years at McKinsey & Company, Chris is a broad-thinking business leader who brings nearly 20 years of strategy, finance and operations experience. 
His deep commercial experience in the quick service and retail sectors, a track record of growth leadership and commitment to culture and talent development make him a perfect fit for the CFO role. 
He's also deeply knowledgeable about digital and technology solutions shaping the future of retail, which will be invaluable to Yum! given the role technology will play as we leverage our scale to improve franchise unit economics and accelerate same-store sales growth and net new unit growth. 
We've also finalized our roles for our brand CEOs as David will discuss in more details in a few minutes. 
And finally, we take our role as a global citizen and our impact on society and the environment very seriously. We've recently updated our Recipe for Good, which outlines our public commitments concerning food, planet and people. We've made tremendous progress over the past year when it comes to advancing our citizenship and sustainability agenda to drive socially responsible growth and manage risk better. From working to remove antibiotics in our protein supply chain to expanding our deforestation commitments to progressing our work around diversity and inclusion, I truly believe we are leveraging our scale to help address major global issues. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results; our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Tale",2165,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results; our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
To begin, our second quarter results. Core operating profit growth increased 18%, and as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 10%, same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 6% growth in both same-store sales and net new unit growth driving 10% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Contribution to the KFC strength were again broad-based. Japan and Africa, which together represent 8% of KFC's system sales, performed particularly well while easier laps at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another tremendous quarter with 10% system sales growth driven by 7% same-store sales growth. 
Our second quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, therefore having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the quarter -- for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 1% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. Again, now that we have lapped the disruption, there will be no benefit from easier laps going forward. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. 
Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 target excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 on the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. 
Our updated estimate of the impact of the FX rate movements is now an $0.08 headwind to the $3.75 number. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.01 headwind and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.01 tailwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiative to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the second quarter while 1.7% of system sales remains the appropriate target for full year 2019. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged from last quarter. 
Our ex-special items effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, which is above the 20% to 22% range we gave at our Analyst Day last December, but follows a 12.2% rate in the first quarter. We are not changing our annual tax rate guidance at this time, but we wanted to mention that it is difficult to forecast this rate with pinpoint accuracy in the near term given uncertainty of equity compensation payouts as well as a continually changing tax landscape across the over 145 countries where our system sales are generated. We will continue to update you as we progress through the back half of the year. 
As for our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $196 million at an average price per share of $104. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.7 billion to date. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell. Its fast and friendly obsession helped our system in speed and break records in sales this quarter. In fact, in the U.S., 6 million more cars drove through drive-thrus compared to 2Q 2018. And our guests received an experience that was on average 7 seconds faster. This attention to improved speed, customer satisfaction and running great restaurants helped the Taco Bell system break 2 weekly sales records just 1 week apart. Internationally, it was my pleasure to visit Italy and Romania, where we spent time with our reigning KFC franchisee of the year, Sphera, a fantastic partner to us in both our KFC and Pizza Hut businesses, who recently launched Taco Bell in Bucharest with encouraging early results. 
At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our Hot, Fast and Reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've also perfected the original Pan Pizza, which is now baked in a newly engineered pan. The use of this new pan results in enhanced flavor, texture and improved customer feedback scores for this iconic fan favorite. 
Internationally, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners, leading to overall customer satisfaction score improvements in markets including Malaysia, Kuwait and UAE. 
Pizza Hut Digital Ventures also expanded its fast casual digital store platform, or FCDS, to Japan and Mexico in 400 and 250 stores, respectively, bringing the total store count to over 2,500. Markets with FCDS or similar technology, which also include India, France, Turkey and Malaysia, have seen increased online transactions as a result. 
At KFC, Greg and I had the pleasure of attending a global operations meeting in Dallas in June which had operators from around the world in attendance, along with both KFC and franchisee leaders represented. The key focus was aligning on strategy when it comes to empowering the frontline leaders of our business, our restaurant general managers. Topics were broad and included ideal equipment design and setup as well as technology options to make life easier for our team members. We were impressed and inspired by the passion of -- our operators have for improving the customer and team member experiences. It was a great example of how collaboration can lead to best-in-class solutions for our businesses across the globe. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 312 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,897, excluding the Telepizza units added in 4Q of last year. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued with 232 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia, Thailand, Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time transforming our asset base to the American Showman image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,600 American Showman restaurants across the country as 104 remodels were completed. 
Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 18 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 2 Urban/Cantina restaurants opened in Manhattan where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns. With 46 Urban/Cantina restaurants across the Taco Bell system at the end of the quarter, they represent a strong complement to our existing asset portfolio and will remain an important part of future development. 
Internationally, Taco Bell opened 13 net new units in 11 countries and signed master franchise agreements in India and Portugal. In particular, I'm very excited to highlight India and our partnership with Burman Hospitality. This is our largest Taco Bell development agreement to date with plans for 600 Taco Bell restaurants over the next 10 years, which would make Burman Hospitality the largest Taco Bell franchisee globally. We are confident in a long runway for growth for Taco Bell International and continue to garner interest from 3 C partners around the globe. 
At Pizza Hut, as Greg mentioned earlier, we are leaning in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. asset base to truly modern delivery/carryout assets. This will ultimately strengthen the Pizza Hut business in the U.S. and set it up for a faster long-term growth. During this transition, we expect a temporary deceleration in the pace of new unit development for the Pizza Hut Division as continued healthy international unit growth will be partially offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. As a result, our U.S. store count could drop to as low 7,000 locations over the next 24 months, primarily driven by closures of underperforming dine-in restaurants before rebounding to current levels and above in the future. 
Further, we believe that Yum! will still deliver 4% annual net new unit growth on average over the next several years. Although as mentioned, it will probably be a little bumpier than our original plans. Importantly, the short-term financial impact should be minimal as the closures will be our lower-volume stores, and long term, this should improve our system sales and profitability as the closed units are replaced with higher-volume stores.
Outside the U.S., Pizza Hut celebrated its 11,000th international restaurant opening alongside its franchise partner, Americana. Located at the waterfront development of Dubai Creek Harbour, this brand-new fast casual delivery store is a great example of a truly modern asset resonating with customers and driving profitable unit development. 
As for our strategic alliance -- our growth -- strategic growth alliance with Telepizza, the integration continues to go very well. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza again reported positive net new unit growth and conversions of Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand.
Next, Unrivaled Culture & Talent. The Board of Directors, Greg and I are excited to have finalized our roles for our brand CEOs. First, Mark King, former President of Adidas Group North America, will join the company as Taco Bell Division Chief Executive Officer, reporting to me effective August 5. Mark brings to Taco Bell and Yum! extensive retail experience and an excellent track record driving growth, innovation, brand relevance and culture. His unique talent of rewriting the rules for brands to win in fiercely competitive markets will be central to Taco Bell's journey to become a $15 billion brand that transcends the quick service restaurant and retail categories. 
We're privileged to be in a position to add Mark's high-caliber talent to the strong and accomplished Taco Bell leadership team we have in place. Under the leadership of Julie Felss Masino, Taco Bell North American President; and Liz Williams, Taco Bell International President, the Taco Bell team has been delivering fantastic results and has reinforced Taco Bell's stronghold as a Category of One brand in the U.S. and internationally. Both Julie and Liz will report to Mark going forward. 
Second, Artie Starrs, President of Pizza Hut U.S., has been promoted to Pizza Hut Division Chief Executive Officer. Artie is a talented growth leader who has made bold moves to galvanize Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees around the Transformation Agreement, strengthen the brand's digital and e-commerce road map, improve operations and the customer experience and articulate a clear path forward to drive Pizza Hut's growth over the long term. I'm confident Artie will help grow and continue to strengthen Pizza Hut's competitive position globally in partnership with Vipul Chawla, President of Pizza Hut International, who is off to a truly fantastic start and now reporting to Artie.
Third, and rounding out the brand CEOs, I'm pleased to report KFC Division Chief Executive Officer Tony Lowings has had an incredible start. Under Tony's leadership, the global KFC system has accelerated beyond what were highly accomplished world-class results across the board. 
In summary, the first half of 2019 was a strong start to the year. We always expected a stronger first half owing to less challenging laps than the second half, but this quarter's results exceeded our already high expectations. With 3 category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

I mean, we've talked a lot about global scale and I just wanted to get a sense of how you view your current franchise community.

And then as far as monitoring leverage, obviously, as part of being a world-class franchisor, we're putting the brands in the hands of our franchisees and we need to make sure that they are all in the best financial health and most capable to grow the brands. That's a big part of what we do, working with franchisees to make sure they have the right kind of financial structure to succeed.

I do think at the same time, value -- even though the customer is in a healthy position, value remains a priority and making sure that we don't walk away from both everyday and disruptive value. So it's about finding that fine line between everyday and disruptive value and obviously driving transactions. 
On the aggregator front, I think what we're clearly learning is that, look, there are people that are loyal to Pizza Hut, there are people that are loyal to Grubhub in our case. The way to grow our business is to increase reach and penetration. And our ability, I think, to partner with both Grubhub and also -- as a party to the sort of Pizza Hut brand enables just to get broader reach.

I think we have, as of the end of the quarter, 7,449 Pizza Hut assets in the U.S. Just a clarifying comment on that. 6,100 of those are traditional restaurants and about 1,350 are Express units. I know sometimes as we calculate percentages of dine-in and stuff, you could use either base. But within our traditional base of 6,100, close to half are dine-in. As -- obviously as part of the 7,449, it's a smaller percentage. 
But as far as the numbers and how the math works, it's hard to estimate how soon the timing of when a store will close and then when the replaced unit will open. There will be gaps at some -- on some of those, but certainly, our goal is to try to minimize those gaps. So it's a little hard to pinpoint an exact number, but -- and that's why we provided the guidance of the store count at any point in time over the next few years could dip down close to that 7,000. But we ultimately -- we know that the economics of building a modern delivery asset work quite well for us, and that any -- for the most part, any area, trade area where a store closes, there should be the opportunity to rebuild a store in that area or somewhere nearby.  
As far as the capital required to do this, we are committed to the asset-light model, the 98% franchised. And we think the economics of building a new unit stand on their own. And we should have no trouble getting either existing or new franchisees ultimately to rebuild in these trade areas. But as we get into the specific situations and sort them out, there may be some situations where we deploy a little capital in the short term to flip a market and get it in the hands of somebody else and take our capital back out.

Obviously, David, as you saw, the momentum was really broad, probably the broadest momentum we've had in KFC. I think I give credit to Tony. We had probably been focused on driving what we call 1 extra transaction, 1 extra occasion from a frequency point of view.

We know exactly what drives both reach and frequency, and I -- what I'm really excited is that he and Catherine Tan, the CMO, have pivoted the brands to really helping us drive reach. And so I think that's also the reason why the transaction growth was so strong in the quarter at plus 3% internationally, which is really half of our same-store sales growth. 
So -- and at the MPMs last week, which we sat through, I think David and I were so impressed with the consistency of what we saw. People are focusing on a very clear, simple and aligned global brand positioning, they're executing it.

It obviously helps that China, as you saw, just upped their guidance for unit development and that China is being -- is having a lot of success with KFC. We're not going to really provide guidance by brand on development. And obviously, some of the tailwinds we have going on at KFC from new unit development will help offset a little bit of the challenges that we'll have on unit count at Pizza Hut. 
Which is why -- we think when you net it all out over the long term, we'll be able to continue to grow Yum! at that 4% rate on average. As the base keeps getting larger, that means that unit counts will keep going up. But KFC is having widespread success, you can see it in the numbers, system sales growth all across the board, and that leads to better unit economics. And franchisees are putting their money behind those better unit economics and building more stores."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter with system sales growth of 10%, including 5% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continues to fuel these results. 
As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of our 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short, as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some additional and exciting news on talent. 
I'll begin with our 3 R.E.D. brands. I'm thrilled to report that KFC delivered its 16th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. Encouragingly, this global powerhouse is seeing broad-based strength across the world with standout performances across many of our largest markets, which translated into a truly impressive global system sales growth of 10% with same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 6% each. 
Now many of you have been asking, ""What's fueling the recent broad-based performance?"" Well, there are a number of factors, including the consumer is healthy. KFC has a robust digital and delivery strategy globally with over 12,000 restaurants delivering on just one metric. And broadly speaking, at Yum!, our focus on being a world-class franchisor has led us to becoming more intentional about fostering collaboration and leveraging the power of Yum!. 
A perfect example of this is the KFC annual market planning meeting, which is one of the first global collaboration meetings we instituted and which continues to gain momentum and impact each year. In fact, our recent 2019 KFC MPM had a record number of franchisees and team members in attendance. 
We also attended the Pizza Hut MPM earlier this week, and I was impressed with how Vipul Chawla and the teams are so focused on the things that matter most. But again, MPMs are just one example of fostering collaboration to drive results today and into the future. Without question, these forums for collaboration are a unique competitive advantage for all our franchise partners and team members globally.
Now back to KFC's quarter. Internationally, sales callouts include: Japan, Africa, Iberia, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, China, Latin America and the Caribbean. You'll notice I included more markets than usual. But again, strength was broad-based with 8 out of 13 markets reporting at or above 6% same-store sales growth. And while each market is unique, the recipe for success has a consistent theme: it's disruptive value coupled with amplified innovation, compounded by an effective digital and delivery strategy. 
Specifically, Japan and Africa led the way, each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 18% same-store sales growth was driven by renewed focus on value and a well-received chicken pack and Pari-Pari  chicken innovation. Africa's 10% same-store sales growth was backed by the Wrapsta lunchbox value promotion and the innovative Crunch Double Down. Iberia's 11% same-store sales growth was driven by continued momentum from strong media campaigns and our third-party delivery partners.
Now to KFC U.S., where same-store sales grew 2% in the quarter. Continued focus on the core menu items was balanced with an accelerated pace of promotions. The quarter began with innovation, first bringing back the very successful Chicken & Waffles and then introducing Cinnabon Biscuits. Value also remained a focus through launching a new channel for a la carte menu items, our 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match. Combined, our new value proposition drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. 
KFC continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivering and click-and-collect throughout this year and also expects to launch a branded web experience by year-end. We now have 2,300 KFCs offering delivery and 3,500 restaurants available for click-and-collect. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees, and we look forward to updating you more throughout the year.
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 2% and flat unit growth. We're happy to report that transactions for the quarter grew 3%, which is the result of continued compelling value, ops execution and our growing loyalty program, Hut Rewards. 
As you may have seen earlier this week, in partnership with our franchisees, we've updated the $5 Lineup to the $5 ‘N-Up Lineup, where we will continue to offer the same favorites at more flexible price points. We expect this to be a win for franchisees by addressing local economic factors, particularly in high-wage markets, while customers benefit from the balance of compelling everyday value and unique only-from-Pizza Hut innovation. 
While we're pleased with the positive transaction growth this quarter, we understand more clearly than ever that same-store sales growth in the U.S. will continue to be choppy without transforming the asset base. And following the tremendous recent improvements in operations and technology led by Artie Starrs and the Pizza Hut leadership team, we plan to lean in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. estate to a more modern delivery and carryout-focused asset base. This will ultimately position the Pizza Hut brand for many years of faster growth in the U.S. 
We are excited about collaborating with franchisees who are capable, well capitalized, committed to the brand and who have a growth mindset to accelerate the closure of underperforming dine-in stores and replacement with new delivery or fast casual delivery assets. 
By the same token, we also know we'll need to directly address franchisees who are burdened with too much debt, don't have access to capital or aren't committed to the long term. Thus, in a few cases, some of these businesses will need to be restructured in the near term to address capital structure and leverage issues, particularly those franchisees with greater dine-in exposure. We view this as a positive move for the brand and David will provide more specifics in a few minutes.  
Before moving on to Pizza Hut International, I want to briefly update you on our excitement regarding our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage it as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. As a reminder, while customers are placing their orders on the Grubhub app or website, Pizza Hut drivers are completing the delivery to ensure our Hot, Fast and Reliable experience. We ended the second quarter with over 300 locations on Grubhub and are planning on expanding the test further in the third quarter. While it's still early days, we found that the Grubhub customers are incremental and some customers are, therefore, trying our craveable products for the first time. 
Pizza Hut International's system sales grew 15% in the quarter driven by a 10-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 2%. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like China, Europe, Brazil, Indonesia and Hong Kong. I recently visited Latin America and got to see some of our newly converted Telepizza units. I'm so impressed with the team and how they are executing at a high level to drive tremendous early results.
Internationally, the same-store sales gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales was approximately 3 points this quarter. Encouragingly, the smaller gap arose from an improvement in our international dine-in business as our 2 largest dine-in markets, China and the U.K., performed well. Pizza Hut continues to develop tailored action plans for our largest dine-in markets while at the same time transforming the estate for a more compelling off-premise-focused asset strategy. 
And last but definitely not least, Taco Bell, where system sales grew 10% with same-store sales growth of 7% and net new unit growth of 3%. Taco Bell has now reported positive same-store sales growth in 17 of the last 18 quarters, including 12 consecutively. So kudos to the entire team for such amazing results. 
Starting with the U.S. We continue to have a focus on both value and innovation, starting Q2 with a $1 Loaded Nacho Taco followed by the $5 Grande Nacho Box and the return of Nacho Fries. The Grande Nachos Box was a particular standout as demand was extremely high, a truly abundant value at just $5, with sales mix peaking at 10%. We also welcomed back Nacho Fries for our fourth faux movie trailer, breaking weekly sales records twice during the promotion. 
The buzzworthy moment of the quarter was the announcement of The Bell hotel in June. Reservations for a Taco Bell-inspired stay in Palm Springs sold out in 2 minutes. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 4,900 restaurants and expects to have the full U.S. rollout completed this year. Delivery is now live in 4,500 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S., and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. The customer experience has been positive, with the #1 reason for getting Taco Bell delivered being the craving for the food. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 11 million registered users. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app. 
Taco Bell International saw strong sales momentum around the world driven by the focus on cult icons, value boxes at price -- at power price points and product innovation. Our value boxes introduced earlier this year continued to drive growth in India, the U.K. and Spain. India's positive same-store sales growth was driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box and Quesalupa. 
We continue to build global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. For example, Canada participated in the Steal a Game, Steal a Taco NBA Finals promotion for the first time and saw fantastic results. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, we have 2 important assets: our brands and our people. We feel great about the level of talent we have and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we've made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage by investing in a new -- in new world-class talent. 
I'd like to start with an enthusiastic thank you to David Gibbs for his incredible leadership as President and CFO the last 3 years. He was a great partner to me as we spun off Yum China and adapted our financial and business strategy to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, all with accelerated growth. Since the beginning of the year, he's worn 3 hats, adding the Chief Operating Officer to his responsibilities, and leading the brands to impressive results while we undertook a search for a new CFO.  
And with that, I'm excited to have Chris Turner join the Yum! family as Chief Financial Officer. Chris will begin reporting to me after filing of our 10-Q on August 8 and will assume global responsibility for finance, corporate strategy, supply chain and information technology. From his time at PepsiCo to his years at McKinsey & Company, Chris is a broad-thinking business leader who brings nearly 20 years of strategy, finance and operations experience. 
His deep commercial experience in the quick service and retail sectors, a track record of growth leadership and commitment to culture and talent development make him a perfect fit for the CFO role. 
He's also deeply knowledgeable about digital and technology solutions shaping the future of retail, which will be invaluable to Yum! given the role technology will play as we leverage our scale to improve franchise unit economics and accelerate same-store sales growth and net new unit growth. 
We've also finalized our roles for our brand CEOs as David will discuss in more details in a few minutes. 
And finally, we take our role as a global citizen and our impact on society and the environment very seriously. We've recently updated our Recipe for Good, which outlines our public commitments concerning food, planet and people. We've made tremendous progress over the past year when it comes to advancing our citizenship and sustainability agenda to drive socially responsible growth and manage risk better. From working to remove antibiotics in our protein supply chain to expanding our deforestation commitments to progressing our work around diversity and inclusion, I truly believe we are leveraging our scale to help address major global issues. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results; our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Tale",2165,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results; our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
To begin, our second quarter results. Core operating profit growth increased 18%, and as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 10%, same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 6% growth in both same-store sales and net new unit growth driving 10% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Contribution to the KFC strength were again broad-based. Japan and Africa, which together represent 8% of KFC's system sales, performed particularly well while easier laps at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another tremendous quarter with 10% system sales growth driven by 7% same-store sales growth. 
Our second quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, therefore having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the quarter -- for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 1% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. Again, now that we have lapped the disruption, there will be no benefit from easier laps going forward. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. 
Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 target excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 on the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. 
Our updated estimate of the impact of the FX rate movements is now an $0.08 headwind to the $3.75 number. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.01 headwind and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.01 tailwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiative to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the second quarter while 1.7% of system sales remains the appropriate target for full year 2019. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged from last quarter. 
Our ex-special items effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, which is above the 20% to 22% range we gave at our Analyst Day last December, but follows a 12.2% rate in the first quarter. We are not changing our annual tax rate guidance at this time, but we wanted to mention that it is difficult to forecast this rate with pinpoint accuracy in the near term given uncertainty of equity compensation payouts as well as a continually changing tax landscape across the over 145 countries where our system sales are generated. We will continue to update you as we progress through the back half of the year. 
As for our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $196 million at an average price per share of $104. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.7 billion to date. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell. Its fast and friendly obsession helped our system in speed and break records in sales this quarter. In fact, in the U.S., 6 million more cars drove through drive-thrus compared to 2Q 2018. And our guests received an experience that was on average 7 seconds faster. This attention to improved speed, customer satisfaction and running great restaurants helped the Taco Bell system break 2 weekly sales records just 1 week apart. Internationally, it was my pleasure to visit Italy and Romania, where we spent time with our reigning KFC franchisee of the year, Sphera, a fantastic partner to us in both our KFC and Pizza Hut businesses, who recently launched Taco Bell in Bucharest with encouraging early results. 
At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our Hot, Fast and Reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've also perfected the original Pan Pizza, which is now baked in a newly engineered pan. The use of this new pan results in enhanced flavor, texture and improved customer feedback scores for this iconic fan favorite. 
Internationally, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners, leading to overall customer satisfaction score improvements in markets including Malaysia, Kuwait and UAE. 
Pizza Hut Digital Ventures also expanded its fast casual digital store platform, or FCDS, to Japan and Mexico in 400 and 250 stores, respectively, bringing the total store count to over 2,500. Markets with FCDS or similar technology, which also include India, France, Turkey and Malaysia, have seen increased online transactions as a result. 
At KFC, Greg and I had the pleasure of attending a global operations meeting in Dallas in June which had operators from around the world in attendance, along with both KFC and franchisee leaders represented. The key focus was aligning on strategy when it comes to empowering the frontline leaders of our business, our restaurant general managers. Topics were broad and included ideal equipment design and setup as well as technology options to make life easier for our team members. We were impressed and inspired by the passion of -- our operators have for improving the customer and team member experiences. It was a great example of how collaboration can lead to best-in-class solutions for our businesses across the globe. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 312 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,897, excluding the Telepizza units added in 4Q of last year. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued with 232 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia, Thailand, Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time transforming our asset base to the American Showman image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,600 American Showman restaurants across the country as 104 remodels were completed. 
Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 18 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 2 Urban/Cantina restaurants opened in Manhattan where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns. With 46 Urban/Cantina restaurants across the Taco Bell system at the end of the quarter, they represent a strong complement to our existing asset portfolio and will remain an important part of future development. 
Internationally, Taco Bell opened 13 net new units in 11 countries and signed master franchise agreements in India and Portugal. In particular, I'm very excited to highlight India and our partnership with Burman Hospitality. This is our largest Taco Bell development agreement to date with plans for 600 Taco Bell restaurants over the next 10 years, which would make Burman Hospitality the largest Taco Bell franchisee globally. We are confident in a long runway for growth for Taco Bell International and continue to garner interest from 3 C partners around the globe. 
At Pizza Hut, as Greg mentioned earlier, we are leaning in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. asset base to truly modern delivery/carryout assets. This will ultimately strengthen the Pizza Hut business in the U.S. and set it up for a faster long-term growth. During this transition, we expect a temporary deceleration in the pace of new unit development for the Pizza Hut Division as continued healthy international unit growth will be partially offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. As a result, our U.S. store count could drop to as low 7,000 locations over the next 24 months, primarily driven by closures of underperforming dine-in restaurants before rebounding to current levels and above in the future. 
Further, we believe that Yum! will still deliver 4% annual net new unit growth on average over the next several years. Although as mentioned, it will probably be a little bumpier than our original plans. Importantly, the short-term financial impact should be minimal as the closures will be our lower-volume stores, and long term, this should improve our system sales and profitability as the closed units are replaced with higher-volume stores.
Outside the U.S., Pizza Hut celebrated its 11,000th international restaurant opening alongside its franchise partner, Americana. Located at the waterfront development of Dubai Creek Harbour, this brand-new fast casual delivery store is a great example of a truly modern asset resonating with customers and driving profitable unit development. 
As for our strategic alliance -- our growth -- strategic growth alliance with Telepizza, the integration continues to go very well. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza again reported positive net new unit growth and conversions of Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand.
Next, Unrivaled Culture & Talent. The Board of Directors, Greg and I are excited to have finalized our roles for our brand CEOs. First, Mark King, former President of Adidas Group North America, will join the company as Taco Bell Division Chief Executive Officer, reporting to me effective August 5. Mark brings to Taco Bell and Yum! extensive retail experience and an excellent track record driving growth, innovation, brand relevance and culture. His unique talent of rewriting the rules for brands to win in fiercely competitive markets will be central to Taco Bell's journey to become a $15 billion brand that transcends the quick service restaurant and retail categories. 
We're privileged to be in a position to add Mark's high-caliber talent to the strong and accomplished Taco Bell leadership team we have in place. Under the leadership of Julie Felss Masino, Taco Bell North American President; and Liz Williams, Taco Bell International President, the Taco Bell team has been delivering fantastic results and has reinforced Taco Bell's stronghold as a Category of One brand in the U.S. and internationally. Both Julie and Liz will report to Mark going forward. 
Second, Artie Starrs, President of Pizza Hut U.S., has been promoted to Pizza Hut Division Chief Executive Officer. Artie is a talented growth leader who has made bold moves to galvanize Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees around the Transformation Agreement, strengthen the brand's digital and e-commerce road map, improve operations and the customer experience and articulate a clear path forward to drive Pizza Hut's growth over the long term. I'm confident Artie will help grow and continue to strengthen Pizza Hut's competitive position globally in partnership with Vipul Chawla, President of Pizza Hut International, who is off to a truly fantastic start and now reporting to Artie.
Third, and rounding out the brand CEOs, I'm pleased to report KFC Division Chief Executive Officer Tony Lowings has had an incredible start. Under Tony's leadership, the global KFC system has accelerated beyond what were highly accomplished world-class results across the board. 
In summary, the first half of 2019 was a strong start to the year. We always expected a stronger first half owing to less challenging laps than the second half, but this quarter's results exceeded our already high expectations. With 3 category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

I mean, we've talked a lot about global scale and I just wanted to get a sense of how you view your current franchise community.

How much more of that do you think should occur within the overall Yum! system? Is there still an opportunity from here to accelerate unit growth?

We view that as a competitive advantage, that we have really professionally run organizations helping us to build our brand. But I don't think we have some -- to answer your question, I don't think we have some big strategy to consolidate. We already have a pretty large number of stores per franchisee. 
And then as far as monitoring leverage, obviously, as part of being a world-class franchisor, we're putting the brands in the hands of our franchisees and we need to make sure that they are all in the best financial health and most capable to grow the brands. That's a big part of what we do, working with franchisees to make sure they have the right kind of financial structure to succeed.

I do think at the same time, value -- even though the customer is in a healthy position, value remains a priority and making sure that we don't walk away from both everyday and disruptive value. So it's about finding that fine line between everyday and disruptive value and obviously driving transactions. 
On the aggregator front, I think what we're clearly learning is that, look, there are people that are loyal to Pizza Hut, there are people that are loyal to Grubhub in our case. The way to grow our business is to increase reach and penetration. And our ability, I think, to partner with both Grubhub and also -- as a party to the sort of Pizza Hut brand enables just to get broader reach. And with broader reach and penetration, we're going to get transaction and sales growth.

I think we have, as of the end of the quarter, 7,449 Pizza Hut assets in the U.S. Just a clarifying comment on that. 6,100 of those are traditional restaurants and about 1,350 are Express units. I know sometimes as we calculate percentages of dine-in and stuff, you could use either base. But within our traditional base of 6,100, close to half are dine-in. As -- obviously as part of the 7,449, it's a smaller percentage. 
But as far as the numbers and how the math works, it's hard to estimate how soon the timing of when a store will close and then when the replaced unit will open. There will be gaps at some -- on some of those, but certainly, our goal is to try to minimize those gaps. So it's a little hard to pinpoint an exact number, but -- and that's why we provided the guidance of the store count at any point in time over the next few years could dip down close to that 7,000. But we ultimately -- we know that the economics of building a modern delivery asset work quite well for us, and that any -- for the most part, any area, trade area where a store closes, there should be the opportunity to rebuild a store in that area or somewhere nearby.  
As far as the capital required to do this, we are committed to the asset-light model, the 98% franchised. And we think the economics of building a new unit stand on their own. And we should have no trouble getting either existing or new franchisees ultimately to rebuild in these trade areas. But as we get into the specific situations and sort them out, there may be some situations where we deploy a little capital in the short term to flip a market and get it in the hands of somebody else and take our capital back out. So we'll update you on that part of the journey as well."

Obviously, David, as you saw, the momentum was really broad, probably the broadest momentum we've had in KFC. I think I give credit to Tony. We had probably been focused on driving what we call 1 extra transaction, 1 extra occasion from a frequency point of view. And what Tony's got the business focused on, as I said earlier, is driving reach and penetration, i.e., broadening the user base. We know exactly what drives both reach and frequency, and I -- what I'm really excited is that he and Catherine Tan, the CMO, have pivoted the brands to really helping us drive reach. And so I think that's also the reason why the transaction growth was so strong in the quarter at plus 3% internationally, which is really half of our same-store sales growth. 
So -- and at the MPMs last week, which we sat through, I think David and I were so impressed with the consistency of what we saw. People are focusing on a very clear, simple and aligned global brand positioning, they're executing it. And a lot of the tactics that we saw, I think even across markets, developed, developing, were consistently strong and I think broad-based.

I know China is helping here, but outside of China, it's really strengthening. And you're growing that portfolio at a 6% clip now. And with the strength in comps, it's just hard to see KFC slowing its unit openings. So is this just a new normal for KFC? Is it going to be a system sales grower that's consistently above your overall kind of at least 7% trend you think about for your portfolio? Anything else you can say about that would be helpful."

And as you know, it keeps getting stronger every quarter. It obviously helps that China, as you saw, just upped their guidance for unit development and that China is being -- is having a lot of success with KFC. We're not going to really provide guidance by brand on development. And obviously, some of the tailwinds we have going on at KFC from new unit development will help offset a little bit of the challenges that we'll have on unit count at Pizza Hut. 
Which is why -- we think when you net it all out over the long term, we'll be able to continue to grow Yum! at that 4% rate on average. As the base keeps getting larger, that means that unit counts will keep going up. But KFC is having widespread success, you can see it in the numbers, system sales growth all across the board, and that leads to better unit economics. And franchisees are putting their money behind those better unit economics and building more stores."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter with system sales growth of 10%, including 5% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our 4 growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continues to fuel these results. 
As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of our 4 key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short, as well as Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some additional and exciting news on talent. 
I'll begin with our 3 R.E.D. brands. I'm thrilled to report that KFC delivered its 16th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. Encouragingly, this global powerhouse is seeing broad-based strength across the world with standout performances across many of our largest markets, which translated into a truly impressive global system sales growth of 10% with same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 6% each. 
Now many of you have been asking, ""What's fueling the recent broad-based performance?"" Well, there are a number of factors, including the consumer is healthy. KFC has a robust digital and delivery strategy globally with over 12,000 restaurants delivering on just one metric. And broadly speaking, at Yum!, our focus on being a world-class franchisor has led us to becoming more intentional about fostering collaboration and leveraging the power of Yum!. 
A perfect example of this is the KFC annual market planning meeting, which is one of the first global collaboration meetings we instituted and which continues to gain momentum and impact each year. In fact, our recent 2019 KFC MPM had a record number of franchisees and team members in attendance. 
We also attended the Pizza Hut MPM earlier this week, and I was impressed with how Vipul Chawla and the teams are so focused on the things that matter most. But again, MPMs are just one example of fostering collaboration to drive results today and into the future. Without question, these forums for collaboration are a unique competitive advantage for all our franchise partners and team members globally.
Now back to KFC's quarter. Internationally, sales callouts include: Japan, Africa, Iberia, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, China, Latin America and the Caribbean. You'll notice I included more markets than usual. But again, strength was broad-based with 8 out of 13 markets reporting at or above 6% same-store sales growth. And while each market is unique, the recipe for success has a consistent theme: it's disruptive value coupled with amplified innovation, compounded by an effective digital and delivery strategy. 
Specifically, Japan and Africa led the way, each with double-digit, same-store sales growth. Japan's 18% same-store sales growth was driven by renewed focus on value and a well-received chicken pack and Pari-Pari  chicken innovation. Africa's 10% same-store sales growth was backed by the Wrapsta lunchbox value promotion and the innovative Crunch Double Down. Iberia's 11% same-store sales growth was driven by continued momentum from strong media campaigns and our third-party delivery partners.
Now to KFC U.S., where same-store sales grew 2% in the quarter. Continued focus on the core menu items was balanced with an accelerated pace of promotions. The quarter began with innovation, first bringing back the very successful Chicken & Waffles and then introducing Cinnabon Biscuits. Value also remained a focus through launching a new channel for a la carte menu items, our 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match. Combined, our new value proposition drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. 
KFC continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivering and click-and-collect throughout this year and also expects to launch a branded web experience by year-end. We now have 2,300 KFCs offering delivery and 3,500 restaurants available for click-and-collect. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees, and we look forward to updating you more throughout the year.
Moving on to our Pizza Hut Division. In the U.S., system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 2% and flat unit growth. We're happy to report that transactions for the quarter grew 3%, which is the result of continued compelling value, ops execution and our growing loyalty program, Hut Rewards. 
As you may have seen earlier this week, in partnership with our franchisees, we've updated the $5 Lineup to the $5 ‘N-Up Lineup, where we will continue to offer the same favorites at more flexible price points. We expect this to be a win for franchisees by addressing local economic factors, particularly in high-wage markets, while customers benefit from the balance of compelling everyday value and unique only-from-Pizza Hut innovation. 
While we're pleased with the positive transaction growth this quarter, we understand more clearly than ever that same-store sales growth in the U.S. will continue to be choppy without transforming the asset base. And following the tremendous recent improvements in operations and technology led by Artie Starrs and the Pizza Hut leadership team, we plan to lean in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. estate to a more modern delivery and carryout-focused asset base. This will ultimately position the Pizza Hut brand for many years of faster growth in the U.S. 
We are excited about collaborating with franchisees who are capable, well capitalized, committed to the brand and who have a growth mindset to accelerate the closure of underperforming dine-in stores and replacement with new delivery or fast casual delivery assets. 
By the same token, we also know we'll need to directly address franchisees who are burdened with too much debt, don't have access to capital or aren't committed to the long term. Thus, in a few cases, some of these businesses will need to be restructured in the near term to address capital structure and leverage issues, particularly those franchisees with greater dine-in exposure. We view this as a positive move for the brand and David will provide more specifics in a few minutes.  
Before moving on to Pizza Hut International, I want to briefly update you on our excitement regarding our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage it as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. As a reminder, while customers are placing their orders on the Grubhub app or website, Pizza Hut drivers are completing the delivery to ensure our Hot, Fast and Reliable experience. We ended the second quarter with over 300 locations on Grubhub and are planning on expanding the test further in the third quarter. While it's still early days, we found that the Grubhub customers are incremental and some customers are, therefore, trying our craveable products for the first time. 
Pizza Hut International's system sales grew 15% in the quarter driven by a 10-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 2%. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like China, Europe, Brazil, Indonesia and Hong Kong. I recently visited Latin America and got to see some of our newly converted Telepizza units. I'm so impressed with the team and how they are executing at a high level to drive tremendous early results.
Internationally, the same-store sales gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales was approximately 3 points this quarter. Encouragingly, the smaller gap arose from an improvement in our international dine-in business as our 2 largest dine-in markets, China and the U.K., performed well. Pizza Hut continues to develop tailored action plans for our largest dine-in markets while at the same time transforming the estate for a more compelling off-premise-focused asset strategy. 
And last but definitely not least, Taco Bell, where system sales grew 10% with same-store sales growth of 7% and net new unit growth of 3%. Taco Bell has now reported positive same-store sales growth in 17 of the last 18 quarters, including 12 consecutively. So kudos to the entire team for such amazing results. 
Starting with the U.S. We continue to have a focus on both value and innovation, starting Q2 with a $1 Loaded Nacho Taco followed by the $5 Grande Nacho Box and the return of Nacho Fries. The Grande Nachos Box was a particular standout as demand was extremely high, a truly abundant value at just $5, with sales mix peaking at 10%. We also welcomed back Nacho Fries for our fourth faux movie trailer, breaking weekly sales records twice during the promotion. 
The buzzworthy moment of the quarter was the announcement of The Bell hotel in June. Reservations for a Taco Bell-inspired stay in Palm Springs sold out in 2 minutes. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 4,900 restaurants and expects to have the full U.S. rollout completed this year. Delivery is now live in 4,500 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S., and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. The customer experience has been positive, with the #1 reason for getting Taco Bell delivered being the craving for the food. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 11 million registered users. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app. 
Taco Bell International saw strong sales momentum around the world driven by the focus on cult icons, value boxes at price -- at power price points and product innovation. Our value boxes introduced earlier this year continued to drive growth in India, the U.K. and Spain. India's positive same-store sales growth was driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box and Quesalupa. 
We continue to build global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. For example, Canada participated in the Steal a Game, Steal a Taco NBA Finals promotion for the first time and saw fantastic results. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. As you've heard me say before, we have 2 important assets: our brands and our people. We feel great about the level of talent we have and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we've made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage by investing in a new -- in new world-class talent. 
I'd like to start with an enthusiastic thank you to David Gibbs for his incredible leadership as President and CFO the last 3 years. He was a great partner to me as we spun off Yum China and adapted our financial and business strategy to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, all with accelerated growth. Since the beginning of the year, he's worn 3 hats, adding the Chief Operating Officer to his responsibilities, and leading the brands to impressive results while we undertook a search for a new CFO.  
And with that, I'm excited to have Chris Turner join the Yum! family as Chief Financial Officer. Chris will begin reporting to me after filing of our 10-Q on August 8 and will assume global responsibility for finance, corporate strategy, supply chain and information technology. From his time at PepsiCo to his years at McKinsey & Company, Chris is a broad-thinking business leader who brings nearly 20 years of strategy, finance and operations experience. 
His deep commercial experience in the quick service and retail sectors, a track record of growth leadership and commitment to culture and talent development make him a perfect fit for the CFO role. 
He's also deeply knowledgeable about digital and technology solutions shaping the future of retail, which will be invaluable to Yum! given the role technology will play as we leverage our scale to improve franchise unit economics and accelerate same-store sales growth and net new unit growth. 
We've also finalized our roles for our brand CEOs as David will discuss in more details in a few minutes. 
And finally, we take our role as a global citizen and our impact on society and the environment very seriously. We've recently updated our Recipe for Good, which outlines our public commitments concerning food, planet and people. We've made tremendous progress over the past year when it comes to advancing our citizenship and sustainability agenda to drive socially responsible growth and manage risk better. From working to remove antibiotics in our protein supply chain to expanding our deforestation commitments to progressing our work around diversity and inclusion, I truly believe we are leveraging our scale to help address major global issues. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."

Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results; our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Tale",2163,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results; our remaining transformation initiatives, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and some exciting news on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
To begin, our second quarter results. Core operating profit growth increased 18%, and as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 10%, same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 6% growth in both same-store sales and net new unit growth driving 10% system sales growth in the quarter. 
Contribution to the KFC strength were again broad-based. Japan and Africa, which together represent 8% of KFC's system sales, performed particularly well while easier laps at KFC U.K. were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another tremendous quarter with 10% system sales growth driven by 7% same-store sales growth. 
Our second quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC U.K. business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2, therefore having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum!. Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC's 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the quarter -- for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 1% for the second quarter and 1% for the full year. Again, now that we have lapped the disruption, there will be no benefit from easier laps going forward. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. 
Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 target excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 on the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. 
Our updated estimate of the impact of the FX rate movements is now an $0.08 headwind to the $3.75 number. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.01 headwind and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.01 tailwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. 
Now turning to our transformation initiative to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the second quarter while 1.7% of system sales remains the appropriate target for full year 2019. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged from last quarter. 
Our ex-special items effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, which is above the 20% to 22% range we gave at our Analyst Day last December, but follows a 12.2% rate in the first quarter. We are not changing our annual tax rate guidance at this time, but we wanted to mention that it is difficult to forecast this rate with pinpoint accuracy in the near term given uncertainty of equity compensation payouts as well as a continually changing tax landscape across the over 145 countries where our system sales are generated. We will continue to update you as we progress through the back half of the year. 
As for our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $196 million at an average price per share of $104. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.7 billion to date. 
Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'll start with Taco Bell. Its fast and friendly obsession helped our system in speed and break records in sales this quarter. In fact, in the U.S., 6 million more cars drove through drive-thrus compared to 2Q 2018. And our guests received an experience that was on average 7 seconds faster. This attention to improved speed, customer satisfaction and running great restaurants helped the Taco Bell system break 2 weekly sales records just 1 week apart. Internationally, it was my pleasure to visit Italy and Romania, where we spent time with our reigning KFC franchisee of the year, Sphera, a fantastic partner to us in both our KFC and Pizza Hut businesses, who recently launched Taco Bell in Bucharest with encouraging early results. 
At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our Hot, Fast and Reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've also perfected the original Pan Pizza, which is now baked in a newly engineered pan. The use of this new pan results in enhanced flavor, texture and improved customer feedback scores for this iconic fan favorite. 
Internationally, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners, leading to overall customer satisfaction score improvements in markets including Malaysia, Kuwait and UAE. 
Pizza Hut Digital Ventures also expanded its fast-casual digital store platform, or FCDS, to Japan and Mexico in 400 and 250 stores, respectively, bringing the total store count to over 2,500. Markets with FCDS or similar technology, which also include India, France, Turkey and Malaysia, have seen increased online transactions as a result. 
At KFC, Greg and I had the pleasure of attending a global operations meeting in Dallas in June which had operators from around the world in attendance, along with both KFC and franchisee leaders represented. The key focus was aligning on strategy when it comes to empowering the frontline leaders of our business, our restaurant general managers. Topics were broad and included ideal equipment design and setup as well as technology options to make life easier for our team members. We were impressed and inspired by the passion of -- our operators have for improving the customer and team member experiences. It was a great example of how collaboration can lead to best-in-class solutions for our businesses across the globe. 
Next, to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 312 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,897, excluding the Telepizza units added in 4Q of last year. 
At KFC, strong development trends continued with 232 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia, Thailand, Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time transforming our asset base to the American Showman image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,600 American Showman restaurants across the country as 104 remodels were completed. 
Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 18 net new units during the quarter. Among those, 2 Urban/Cantina restaurants opened in Manhattan where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns. With 46 Urban/Cantina restaurants across the Taco Bell system at the end of the quarter, they represent a strong complement to our existing asset portfolio and will remain an important part of future development. 
Internationally, Taco Bell opened 13 net new units in 11 countries and signed master franchise agreements in India and Portugal. In particular, I'm very excited to highlight India and our partnership with Burman Hospitality. This is our largest Taco Bell development agreement to date with plans for 600 Taco Bell restaurants over the next 10 years, which would make Burman Hospitality the largest Taco Bell franchisee globally. We are confident in a long runway for growth for Taco Bell International and continue to garner interest from 3 C partners around the globe. 
At Pizza Hut, as Greg mentioned earlier, we are leaning in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. asset base to truly modern delivery/carryout assets. This will ultimately strengthen the Pizza Hut business in the U.S. and set it up for a faster long-term growth. During this transition, we expect a temporary deceleration in the pace of new unit development for the Pizza Hut Division as continued healthy international unit growth will be partially offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. As a result, our U.S. store count could drop to as low 7,000 locations over the next 24 months, primarily driven by closures of underperforming dine-in restaurants before rebounding to current levels and above in the future. 
Further, we believe that Yum! will still deliver 4% annual net new unit growth on average over the next several years. Although as mentioned, it will probably be a little bumpier than our original plans. Importantly, the short-term financial impact should be minimal as the closures will be our lower-volume stores, and long term, this should improve our system sales and profitability as the closed units are replaced with higher-volume stores.
Outside the U.S., Pizza Hut celebrated its 11,000th international restaurant opening alongside its franchise partner, Americana. Located at the waterfront development of Dubai Creek Harbour, this brand-new fast-casual delivery store is a great example of a truly modern asset resonating with customers and driving profitable unit development. 
As for our strategic alliance -- our growth -- strategic growth alliance with Telepizza, the integration continues to go very well. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza again reported positive net new unit growth and conversions of Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand.
Next, Unrivaled Culture & Talent. The Board of Directors, Greg and I are excited to have finalized our roles for our brand CEOs. First, Mark King, former President of Adidas Group North America, will join the company as Taco Bell Division Chief Executive Officer, reporting to me effective August 5. Mark brings to Taco Bell and Yum! extensive retail experience and an excellent track record driving growth, innovation, brand relevance and culture. His unique talent of rewriting the rules for brands to win in fiercely competitive markets will be central to Taco Bell's journey to become a $15 billion brand that transcends the quick service restaurant and retail categories. 
We're privileged to be in a position to add Mark's high-caliber talent to the strong and accomplished Taco Bell leadership team we have in place. Under the leadership of Julie Felss Masino, Taco Bell North American President; and Liz Williams, Taco Bell International President, the Taco Bell team has been delivering fantastic results and has reinforced Taco Bell's stronghold as a Category of One brand in the U.S. and internationally. Both Julie and Liz will report to Mark going forward. 
Second, Artie Starrs, President of Pizza Hut U.S., has been promoted to Pizza Hut Division Chief Executive Officer. Artie is a talented growth leader who has made bold moves to galvanize Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees around the Transformation Agreement, strengthen the brand's digital and e-commerce road map, improve operations and the customer experience and articulate a clear path forward to drive Pizza Hut's growth over the long term. I'm confident Artie will help grow and continue to strengthen Pizza Hut's competitive position globally in partnership with Vipul Chawla, President of Pizza Hut International, who is off to a truly fantastic start and now reporting to Artie.
Third, and rounding out the brand CEOs, I'm pleased to report KFC Division Chief Executive Officer Tony Lowings has had an incredible start. Under Tony's leadership, the global KFC system has accelerated beyond what were highly accomplished world-class results across the board. 
In summary, the first half of 2019 was a strong start to the year. We always expected a stronger first half owing to less challenging laps than the second half, but this quarter's results exceeded our already high expectations. With 3 category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

How much more of that do you think should occur within the overall Yum! system? Is there still an opportunity from here to accelerate unit growth?

We view that as a competitive advantage, that we have really professionally run organizations helping us to build our brand. But I don't think we have some -- to answer your question, I don't think we have some big strategy to consolidate. We already have a pretty large number of stores per franchisee. 
And then as far as monitoring leverage, obviously, as part of being a world-class franchisor, we're putting the brands in the hands of our franchisees and we need to make sure that they are all in the best financial health and most capable to grow the brands. That's a big part of what we do, working with franchisees to make sure they have the right kind of financial structure to succeed.

I do think at the same time, value -- even though the customer is in a healthy position, value remains a priority and making sure that we don't walk away from both everyday and disruptive value. So it's about finding that fine line between everyday and disruptive value and obviously driving transactions. 
On the aggregator front, I think what we're clearly learning is that, look, there are people that are loyal to Pizza Hut, there are people that are loyal to Grubhub in our case. The way to grow our business is to increase reach and penetration. And our ability, I think, to partner with both Grubhub and also -- as a party to the sort of Pizza Hut brand enables just to get broader reach. And with broader reach and penetration, we're going to get transaction and sales growth.

I think we have, as of the end of the quarter, 7,449 Pizza Hut assets in the U.S. Just a clarifying comment on that. 6,100 of those are traditional restaurants and about 1,350 are Express units. I know sometimes as we calculate percentages of dine-in and stuff, you could use either base. But within our traditional base of 6,100, close to half are dine-in. As -- obviously as part of the 7,449, it's a smaller percentage. 
But as far as the numbers and how the math works, it's hard to estimate how soon the timing of when a store will close and then when the replaced unit will open. There will be gaps at some -- on some of those, but certainly, our goal is to try to minimize those gaps. So it's a little hard to pinpoint an exact number, but -- and that's why we provided the guidance of the store count at any point in time over the next few years could dip down close to that 7,000. But we ultimately -- we know that the economics of building a modern delivery asset work quite well for us, and that any -- for the most part, any area, trade area where a store closes, there should be the opportunity to rebuild a store in that area or somewhere nearby.  
As far as the capital required to do this, we are committed to the asset-light model, the 98% franchised. And we think the economics of building a new unit stand on their own. And we should have no trouble getting either existing or new franchisees ultimately to rebuild in these trade areas. But as we get into the specific situations and sort them out, there may be some situations where we deploy a little capital in the short term to flip a market and get it in the hands of somebody else and take our capital back out. So we'll update you on that part of the journey as well."

Obviously, David, as you saw, the momentum was really broad, probably the broadest momentum we've had in KFC. I think I give credit to Tony. We had probably been focused on driving what we call 1 extra transaction, 1 extra occasion from a frequency point of view. And what Tony's got the business focused on, as I said earlier, is driving reach and penetration, i.e., broadening the user base. We know exactly what drives both reach and frequency, and I -- what I'm really excited is that he and Catherine Tan, the CMO, have pivoted the brands to really helping us drive reach. And so I think that's also the reason why the transaction growth was so strong in the quarter at plus 3% internationally, which is really half of our same-store sales growth. 
So -- and at the MPMs last week, which we sat through, I think David and I were so impressed with the consistency of what we saw. People are focusing on a very clear, simple and aligned global brand positioning, they're executing it. And a lot of the tactics that we saw, I think even across markets, developed, developing, were consistently strong and I think broad-based.

It obviously helps that China, as you saw, just upped their guidance for unit development and that China is being -- is having a lot of success with KFC. We're not going to really provide guidance by brand on development. And obviously, some of the tailwinds we have going on at KFC from new unit development will help offset a little bit of the challenges that we'll have on unit count at Pizza Hut. 
Which is why -- we think when you net it all out over the long term, we'll be able to continue to grow Yum! at that 4% rate on average. As the base keeps getting larger, that means that unit counts will keep going up. But KFC is having widespread success, you can see it in the numbers, system sales growth all across the board, and that leads to better unit economics. And franchisees are putting their money behind those better unit economics and building more stores."

Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call. 
Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation for today's call. First, all system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, Pizza Hut Division and worldwide system sales and net new unit growth include the benefit of the increase in units in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our strategic alliance with Telepizza. Same-store sales growth reflects the inclusion of Telepizza in the prior year base. Third, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. Fourth, the lease accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1, 2019. As a reminder, this is a GAAP required change resulting in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We do not expect a change in our income statement or cash flows as a result of this accounting change. And last, please note that 2019 results will include a 53rd week.

Following a very strong first half and in line with our expectations, third quarter results were healthy and consistent with our long-term growth model.

Following a very strong first half and in line with our expectations, third quarter results were healthy and consistent with our long-term growth model. Yum! delivered third quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 3% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. While we're pleased with our results, we know there is always work to be done. 
I'd like to begin today's call with a few opening remarks before I hand it over to Chris, who will go over our third quarter results and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss our 4 growth drivers, Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, as we say, R.E.D. for short; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and then some additional news on culture and talent. 
Now to start at the top. I'm confident that the Board and I have identified the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth for Yum!. We're delighted that David will officially take over as CEO in January. David has been a fantastic partner to me throughout our transformation these past few years. We've always shared an unwavering belief in people, their development and our culture and will continue to invest in making Yum! the best place to work.
I'm also immensely proud of the progress we've made by making both the Taco Bell and the KFC brands R.E.D. and accelerating the pace of global unit development. But there is always unfinished business, and for us, that unfinished business includes consistently enhancing the customer experience by ensuring that we have the best people, technology and assets. And this unfinished business is probably most pronounced at Pizza Hut U.S. I'm proud of Artie Starrs and his team as they continue to make significant progress on many aspects of the turnaround of this business such as enhancing product quality, improving the speed of service, introducing a loyalty program and upgrading our technology over the past few years. And as we announced last quarter, they're leaning in to accelerate the transition of our asset base to one with modern delivery carryout assets while also moving aggressively to evolve our franchisee base so that we can deliver a world-class experience every time.
We know that some of our franchisees' economics are pressured, particularly in higher-wage markets. At the same time, others are overleveraged, and some simply aren't the right operating partner for us to grow this brand. We know this transition won't be easy, but we are committed to doing the right thing for this iconic brand over the long term. To be clear, we have many existing Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that have the capital, commitment and capability to bring the brand to life the right way, and we will continue to support and partner with them on the brand turnaround. Of course, this transition will undoubtedly lead to some disruption and choppiness in the short term, and I'm confident that Artie and his team are set to tackle this head on.
Now you want to leave the business better than you found it but also with the knowledge it'll be better after you're gone, and that's exactly how I feel today. We've accelerated growth while simultaneously executing a major transformation. And now nothing will give me more pleasure than to watch our brands and each of our employee and franchise partners go from strength to strength.
When I got the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Yum! starting in 2015, the goal was to lead our culture to fuel results and continue to build brands that people trust and champion while driving aggressive unit expansion. This has always been and remains a foundational pillar for me. We then built on this foundation with the separation of Yum! China in October 2016, which was a starting point of our 3-year transformation. We became maniacal about being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to generate more growth and create a world with more Yum!.
We're confident we are well under way to accomplishing our 2016 transformation goals. We completed our refranchising program and are 98% franchised. We have demonstrated financial discipline by meeting our goal of G&A being 1.7% of system sales and by reducing run rate CapEx. We're on track to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases between 2017 and 2019, and we've generated over 80% total shareholder return since we announced the transformation. Additionally, we closed creative and transformative deals to drive profitable system sales growth for Yum! and our franchisees for years to come. We've achieved healthy same-store sales, and our pace of net new unit growth has nearly doubled since we announced our transformation in 2016. 
Our work is not finished, but I'm extremely proud, and I believe the Yum! family is equally proud of what we have accomplished. And we're even more excited about our future growth potential. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Chris Turner."

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and our remaining transformation initiatives. 
To begin, the results. Core operating profit grew 6%, and as Greg mentioned, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution with 3% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 8% system sales growth in the quarter. Similarly, Taco Bell had another great quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% for both same-store sales and net new unit growth. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses for marking to market our Grubhub investment. We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements is now a $0.12 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast, which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.02 tailwind, and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.14 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.57. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the third quarter. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged. For reference, details of our guidance are available on our website in the Investors section.
Regarding our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period, 2017 through 2019, remains firmly on track. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $174 million at an average price per share below $115. When combined with dividends, we've already returned $6 billion toward our target $6.5 billion to $7 billion. 
Last but certainly not least, some updates on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Elevating our customer experience with digital and technology at the forefront is key to growing our brands. To that end, Clay Johnson has joined us as Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer, or CDTO; and Gavin Felder will be promoted to Yum! Chief Strategy Officer effective December 1. These newly created leadership positions will report to me and partner with our brands to accelerate global growth through technology and disruptive innovation. Clay has over 20 years of industry experience and comes to us from Walmart where he served as CIO. In his new role as CDTO, Clay will oversee Yum!'s global technology strategy, partnering with our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell divisions. He will lead a coordinated, cross-brand effort to accelerate Yum!'s digital commerce strategy, data and analytics and emerging technologies to enhance the customer and employee experience. Additionally, he will provide strategic oversight to our global technology risk management and IT shared services teams. These critical connections will ensure that our technology implementations are developed with the security of our data and infrastructure as a top priority. 
As Chief Strategy Officer, Gavin will be responsible for developing Yum! Brands' long-term corporate strategies and partnering closely with the global brand divisions to implement initiatives to unlock new sources of growth and disruptive innovation. He will work closely with Clay to integrate technology-centric solutions across their operations, including restaurant technology strategies to elevate the customer and team member experience. Gavin is a successful digital leader and proven growth strategist. He started nearly 12 years ago when Yum! Restaurants International as a finance manager before becoming CFO of KFC Africa and later CFO of KFC Global. In his current role, Gavin has overseen strategy, digital and technology, financial planning, supply chain and IT security of our largest global brand. 
With that, I'll hand it off to our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,639984583,1844702,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. We'll conclude our call today with an update on our growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. I'll start with our R.E.D.",2080,"Thank you, Chris. We'll conclude our call today with an update on our growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
I'll start with our R.E.D. brands. KFC delivered its 17th consecutive positive of positive same-store sales growth. This global powerhouse continues to show broad-based strength from standout -- with standout performances across many of our largest markets. This translated into division system sales growth of 8% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 6%. 
International callouts include India, [ SOPAC ], Latin America and our Russia business unit, which includes Central and Eastern Europe. India delivered 7% same-store sales growth driven by distinctive marketing, promotion of the Zinger Burger and consistent value with the ultimate savings bucket. Australia continued to impress with 8% same-store sales growth, their best quarter in recent history. Drivers included the successful Hot Rods promotion and delivery. Russia, Central and Eastern Europe posted a strong 7% same-store sales growth owing to a Bucket for $1 value promotion and the Finger Lickin' Good spin on a taco, Locos Tacos. 
In the U.S., same-store sales declined 1% in the quarter. We had a temporary loss of momentum with the [ Chitos Sandwich ] promotion, which led to the quarter's decline. However, our value promotion of 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match provided us with a new channel for a la carte menu items, and the quarter brought us many valuable insights to improve future performance. We made a splash with plant-based fried chicken alternatives with Beyond Nuggets and Beyond Boneless Wings. The results were very positive. We sold out in 5 hours and generated $2 billion worth of media impressions -- 2 billion media impressions. 
Then at the end of the quarter, we launch Mac & Cheese Balls, which builds off of flavors you've already seen but packaged in a unique KFC style. We're bullish on the future and are excited about our plans for the rest of 2019 and beyond.
In addition, KFC U.S. continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivery and click-and-collect. We officially launched online ordering at KFC.com on October 13 in conjunction with the introduction of Kentucky Fried Wings and our Rudy-inspired advertising. We now have 2,700 KFCs offering delivery in 3,700 restaurants available for Click and Collect. We're excited about owning our own digital channel and the operation the ease it provides our franchisees while Grubhub takes care of the delivery. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut where division system sales grew 7% with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 9%. Pizza Hut International system sales grew 14% in the quarter driven by a 9-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 1%. Importantly, we reported positive system sales growth across all international business units during the quarter. In addition, we were encouraged by 3% same-store sales growth in the off-premise segment of our businesses this quarter, lapping similar 3% growth last year or 6% on a 2-year basis. The team's focus on the fundamentals of a modern delivery experience is clearly producing results and a good sign for the future of this business as we migrate more and more to an asset-based positioned to win in off-premise.
In addition to system sales growth gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales narrowed from historical levels this quarter to 3 points, reducing the drag on our performance from dine-in. 
In the U.S., system sales declined 2% with same-store sales declining 3% and a 1% net new unit decline. Coming off a solid second quarter, the Pizza Hut U.S. business decelerated in Q3 as changes to our value offerings helped franchisee margins but had a negative impact on transactions. In addition, our previously announced plans to accelerate the transition to a modern delivery asset base in the U.S. while restructuring and upgrading our franchisee base also took a toll on performance.
While we strongly believe that these are the right strategies to build the business for the longer term, these moves will introduce some uncertainty in the business performance over the short term as we expect results to continue to be choppy. We caution we could see a continuation of soft sales and unit contraction throughout 2020 in the Pizza Hut U.S. business. Of course, we know that when we have great franchise operators running first-class assets, that are well positioned in trade areas to serve customers, we win in the marketplace, and the Pizza Hut U.S. team is working hard to accelerate this transition.
We continue to expand our Grubhub partnership test with Pizza Hut, which is now active in over 700 restaurants. Pizza Hut is well positioned to leverage being listed on the Grubhub marketplace but by fulfilling delivery orders through our own delivery network. This gives us better control of the customer experience.
Last but not least, Taco Bell, where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 4%. In the U.S., innovation and value continue to be cornerstones of our success. Promotions included Stake Reaper Ranch Fries and the return of the Triple Double Crunchwrap, both of which mixed above 9%. But the Triple Double was the standout of the quarter, available in a $5 box and a la carte. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 6,100 restaurants, and we launched localized AI-driven product recommendations to efficiently give our customers what they want. TS results are encouraging with consistent check list and utilization. We see particularly strong consumer appeal in the urban markets. In fact, in Manhattan, TS utilization is over 50% of our company cantinas. Digital menu boards are offered in over 1,000 locations with a new simplified menu. Delivery is now live in 4,800 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 14 million registered users. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app.
Internationally, we continue to build a Category of One brand. We had strong sales momentum around the world driven by focus on iconic core products, value boxes at power price points and product innovation. We saw widespread strength in the Philippines, Japan, Canada and Europe. We continue to strengthen global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. 
The U.K. ran a Steal a Base, Steal a Taco promotion tied to the Major League Baseball London series generating strong media buzz and sales momentum.
Next, on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 389 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,876, excluding the Telepizza units added in fourth quarter of last year. At KFC, development continued to be strong in Q3 with 317 net new units across 52 countries. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Thailand. In the U.S., we've seen more positive momentum and closed out Q3 with over 1,800 American Showman restaurants across the country.
At Pizza Hut, as we transition the U.S. asset base, we expect the pace of new unit development for the division to decelerate as healthy international unit growth will be offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. All in, the division opened 17 net new units during the quarter. Pizza Hut International opened 76 net new units with noteworthy contributions from Asia, Latin America and Iberia.
Taco Bell delivered 55 net new units during the quarter. In the U.S., we opened 4 new urban style Cantina restaurants, hitting the 50-restaurant milestone. Recent urban Cantina openings include Chicago, San Jose, Champaign and Fort Lauderdale. Internationally, Thailand launched a third store, which is the first outside expat communities in Bangkok. And China and Australia each opened their fifth location. We're continuing to build franchise development capability through events such as the Development Convention in Guatemala, a 4-day event covering development principles and best practices to foster 3C partners around the world.
Next, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. First, I'd like to highlight the greatness that the executive team and myself had with Joey Wat and the Yum! China team earlier this month. We were excited to learn about the work they're doing to lead innovation across many aspects of their business, and as always, we were incredibly impressed with their operational execution and overall focus on putting the customer first across all our brands. 
At KFC, we've seen solid improvements across the board, sharing improvement ideas and global best practices when it comes to ops-driven sales enablers. This is particularly the case when it comes to speed. Our franchisees in [ SOPAC ] created a competitive speed initiative called [ Best Friday ], which was then adopted by the U.K. to great success. 
At Taco Bell, we're proud to announce this was our fastest Q3 in 5 years, which wouldn't have been possible without the commitment from over -- from our over 7,000 general managers and their teams to deliver unrivaled, fast and friendly service. Our Summer Speed challenge was a huge driver of this success. We were 17 seconds faster and saw 3 million more cars in our drive-through.
At Pizza Hut, we have successfully improved our system average delivery speed, which allows us to deliver hotter pizzas faster to our customers' door. While technology in data science have unlocked key insight, the credit goes to our restaurant leaders and drivers who have been implementing these at the store level to provide a Hot, Fast and Reliable expense for our delivery customers.
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Yum!'s 2 biggest assets are our brands and our people. As we build the world's most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands, our culture continues to be a strength and is a key enabler of our continued success. We recently completed our 2019 employee engagement survey of all corporate above restaurant employees globally, and we scored #1 on employee engagement among an elite benchmark of over 300 global companies.
95% of the corporate employees surveyed are proud to work at Yum!, and 91% believe our company is a great place to work. What's even more encouraging is that we have accomplished these results during a time of significant business transformation.
I'd like to finish by saying how excited I am and privileged I am to serve as the next CEO of Yum!. Under Greg's leadership, we have achieved so much already. Of course, there is still more we can achieve in the future. Everywhere we operate, we need to continue elevating and investing in a world-class customer experience with unrivaled talent, modern assets and the best operations with disruptive and innovative technology. This effort will only be realized through a strong partnership with our 2,000 franchisees who run our restaurants and [ over ] 1.5 million restaurant team members who bring ours brand to life around the world every day. When we are our best, we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Before we take your questions, I want to personally thank Greg for his tremendous leadership. As we all know, Greg's been making meaningful contributions to Yum! for the past 25 years. He's been fully committed to developing our talent, increasing our collaboration, elevating our brands and growing our business. Yet, most importantly, Greg's visions to take Yum!'s unique recognition culture and use it to fuel even better results is what we will all remember. It goes without saying that Greg's big personality and positive energy make him not only a great leader but also one of the best partners and friends I could have had over the last many years. There's no question that working with Greg, day in and day out, has helped prepare me for this next role and also given me a ton of laughs along the way. It's hard to believe that this will be Greg's last earnings call. On behalf of the entire Yum! system, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact that he has made to our business. And we wish Greg and his wife, Carol, the very best as they move into this new, exciting chapter.
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

Two, is there an opportunity for the company again to sort of step in either as an intermediary or as provide some temporary support from advertising? And some way to smooth this process better? Because I think as you look out over 12 months, you want to avoid obviously a disruption. 
And three, I think there was a callout on the profits of the Pizza Hut business U.S., the drag or detraction from past due receivables. How big is that? And is that something we need to be cognizant of as we think about the next year or so? And does it impact the global core operating profit growth?"

As far as the disruption, as you can imagine, when we're closing a lot of stores and opening new stores, that can be an enormous distraction, particularly if we are taking the lead on transitioning franchisees out of the system and their stores into the hands of new players. Some of that will get to the receivables, which Chris will talk about. And also while transactions are taking place, obviously, there's a focus issue in terms of where franchisees' focus is. 
As far as the company stepping in and playing an active role in some of this, I wouldn't rule that out, but that's certainly not the plan now. The great thing about the Pizza Hut U.S. business is we have plenty of people that want to get into it and are eager to buy stores and invest capital into fixing those stores and relocating them. So we see our role is more of a facilitator than we do as somebody to be buying stores, given our asset-light model. But I do think there probably -- there could be an opportunity at different points in time for us to take control of some stores as they transition to another party if that's a better way to approach it. So I wouldn't rule that out. And then I'll let Chris just talk about that the receivables."

John, on the receivables side, clearly, as being an outstanding franchise operator is one of our top priorities. And our stores do perform the best when we have committed, capable and well-capitalized franchisees. As David just mentioned, we are working to evolve that Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee base, and you did see noted that the past due receivables balances did have an impact. But to kind of put it in context, as we transition certain Pizza Hut franchisees, we will see an uptick in that bad debt. But again, to put it in context, year-to-date, we have reported about $200 million in fee income from our U.S. franchise system, and over 95% of that, we have either collected or anticipate collecting. Obviously, we'll try to minimize the choppiness as we go through this process, but we do believe that the work that we're doing will ultimately be the right thing to strengthen the brand and the overall system."

I think like a lot of companies, we have a healthy dissatisfaction in terms of our tech agenda, and we're going after it much more aggressively, and Chris can talk a little bit about that. 
As far as what we've done to date, obviously, the QuikOrder transaction has worked out quite well. By bringing them in-house, we've been able to improve their capabilities and provide better services to our franchisees at lower costs. The deal with Grubhub has given us great commercial terms for our franchisees. And that's allowed us to uniformly launch delivery without having the pushback that I think others may have seen, both in Taco Bell and the KFC system. But I know with -- one of the reasons I'm very excited about Chris joining the team and Clay Johnson joining the team is these guys bring a lot to the tech discussion as well as Gavin Felder, and I know they've got a lot of plans going forward."

Obviously, for competitive reasons, we can't go into a lot of detail on our future strategies. But just to give a little bit of color. I think there are probably 3 ways that we could advance technology. One would be evaluating and considering potential acquisitions or investments in technology companies to help leverage our scale, bring those technologies to our stores and our  franchisees. Second could be commercial arrangements that we make with technology providers that give our franchisees advantaged economics in taking advantage of those technologies. And then third, given the strength of her team, we'll be developing internally proprietary technologies. So those will be the 3 ways that we can leverage scale in this area. The areas that we'll be hunting in range across the full technology spectrum, but e-commerce, data and analytics and any innovations that improve the customer experience and the economics in our stores will clearly be at the forefront."

Obviously, you've obviously made some fairly Gotshal's total unit count comments are on Pizza Hut. Just wanted to get a little bit more clarification there. And then on Taco Bell, I think the comments were, in the press release, [ 67 ] gross units in 13 countries. It's hard to drive scale at those kind of numbers internationally, but are we at the point now where Taco Bell can materially accelerate into 2020? And I'd like a follow-up as well."

So I'll talk about Yum! in general. We've raised our guidance previously to 4% net unit growth. We still think that's a right number for the long term. As we've highlighted on the last earnings call with leaning in on Pizza Hut, that introduced a little bit more uncertainty into the pace of development. But we still think, over the next few years, we will average that 4% unit growth number. 
As far as Taco Bell, that's actually one of the areas that I think we're most excited about, what's going on in international. We, by choice, focused on a few countries to try to get the pace of development really going in those countries. So you highlight that it's 13 countries, but when you get our franchisees that sign up to build 600 units in India, obviously, that can make a meaningful step change to the pace of our development at Taco Bell internationally, to just take 1 example. But we will be expanding to additional countries over time. But I think we're really at the point where Taco Bell International development can start to become a more meaningful contributor to us. 
And then as far as KFC maintaining their lofty pace of development, we see no reason why that can't continue, and the strength of that brand is something that I would just highlight for everybody on this earnings call. It just continues to be widespread strength with clear brand positioning, a team that's really energized about the growth prospects ahead of us and absolutely believe in the -- our ability to continue to grow and develop and accelerate the pace of KFC development."

As far as the pizza business, I wanted to make sure we all recognize that the Pizza Hut International business is performing quite well, starting to really deliver on some of the things that we've been looking for out of that business in terms of moving to a modern delivery asset base. We talked about in the earnings -- in the script the fact that they are plus 6% on the off-premise sales on a 2-year basis, plus 3, lapping a 3. All of that is a really good sign in terms of the strength of the Pizza Hut brand when it's executed by -- in the market. The Pizza Hut U.S. business, as we've talked about also previously, has some unique challenges given the dine-in state and the conditions of the assets on the locations of those assets. So that's what they're trying to address by moving to a more modern delivery estate and setting the business up for long-term health. Unfortunately, a lot of franchisees or some franchisees have some debt that makes it hard to relocate those assets, and that's what we're working through with those parties to get the stores in the hands of the right partners that are well capitalized to grow and build the business. It's not the majority of our franchisees. The majority of our franchisees are good partners and doing a nice job. But as you know, the QSR category is facing a lot of wage pressures right now, and that is pressuring unit-level economics and franchisees' economics. But as we always remind people, building a new Pizza Hut is a good investment. The unit economics stand on themselves. This is more about working through with select group of franchisees that may have more debt on their business than they should to get those stores capitalized properly and in the right hands of the right partners."

I guess on the question of aggregators, obviously, we value our partnership with Grubhub. And one of the key features of that partnership, to your point, Sara, is that we integrated the technologies so that the orders get past directly into our POS systems. That wasn't easy. That was a part of the reason there was a delay the launch. But we think that does give us a true competitive advantage over a lot of other people that are working with aggregators. So we haven't really had issues that you're alluding to in terms of being able to get the orders to the stores accurately and then back out to the customer. And I think that's why it's working so well.
As far as KFC and Beyond Nuggets, obviously, we're all intrigued by plant-based meat alternatives, and the success that we did with Beyond -- the success of that test that we did with Beyond obviously is a good sign. We've done another test around the world. That's not the only one that we've done. It's the one that's garnered the most press in the U.S. So you can expect more to come on that front. You saw, just a couple of weeks ago, Pizza Hut launched, in the U.S., launched their compostable box and did so with the plant-based alternative meat topping. So we think there is plenty of application for it, but more to come on that over time."

Now that we've got a better machine, we'd like to drive faster and grow faster. And I'll detail a lot of this as we get into 2020, but just to give you a preview. We've talked about this Recipe for Growth and how it's been fueling our growth over the last couple of years. I think there's an opportunity to lean in further within the Recipe for Growth on the customer experience. We are now consistently executing the customer experience around the world to the standards that we have. We have pockets of excellence. We can be more consistent on that. There's obviously an opportunity on technology, which Chris talked about. And then there's an opportunity to better leverage our scale. I think now that we are more of a franchisor, less of an equity operator, that gives us the ability to turn our focus to leveraging the scale on behalf of the entire system. We're organized in a better way to do that. I think you've seen more collaboration around the world, again, thanks to Greg's leadership in dialing up the collaboration. All of that leads to an opportunity on scale. I do think that potentially could be something that would give us a benefit if we did an acquisition. So we don't need an acquisition to grow. Our brands today are strong generally around the world with plenty of growth opportunities, but we certainly wouldn't rule out an acquisition. 
I think the other thing that you'll see us talk about is as we've talked a lot about the Recipe for Growth. At the same time, we've had what we called our Recipe for Good that our businesses are doing all around the world and their communities around people, planet and food. We'll talk more about that as we get into 2020 and the way we can dial up our communication on that and our efforts in that area."

Same-store sales growth reflects the inclusion of Telepizza in the prior year base. Third, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. Fourth, the lease accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1, 2019. As a reminder, this is a GAAP-required change resulting in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We do not expect a change in our income statement or cash flows as a result of this accounting change. And last, please note that 2019 results will include a 53rd week. 
We're broadcasting this call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both the live conference and in any future use of the recording. 
We'd like to make you aware of the following changes in upcoming Yum! investor events. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of the Form 10-Q filing. Fourth quarter 2019 earnings will be released on February 6, 2019, with a conference call on the same day. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed."

Following a very strong first half and in line with our expectations, third quarter results were healthy and consistent with our long-term growth model.

Following a very strong first half and in line with our expectations, third quarter results were healthy and consistent with our long-term growth model. Yum! delivered third quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 3% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. While we're pleased with our results, we know there is always work to be done. 
I'd like to begin today's call with a few opening remarks before I hand it over to Chris, who will go over our third quarter results and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss our 4 growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinct Brands, or as we say, R.E.D. for short; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and then some additional news on Culture & Talent. 
Now to start at the top. I'm confident that the Board and I have identified the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth for Yum!. We're delighted that David will officially take over as CEO in January. David has been a fantastic partner to me throughout our transformation these past few years. We've always shared an unwavering belief in people, their development and our culture and will continue to invest in making Yum! the best place to work.
I'm also immensely proud of the progress we've made by making both the Taco Bell and the KFC brands R.E.D. and accelerating the pace of global unit development. But there is always unfinished business, and for us, that unfinished business includes consistently enhancing the customer experience by ensuring that we have the best people, technology and assets. And this unfinished business is probably most pronounced at Pizza Hut U.S. 
I'm proud of Artie Starrs and his team as they continue to make significant progress on many aspects of the turnaround of this business, such as enhancing product quality, improving the speed of service, introducing a loyalty program and upgrading our technology over the past few years. And as we announced last quarter, they're leaning in to accelerate the transition of our asset base to one with modern delivery carryout assets while also moving aggressively to evolve our franchisee base so that we can deliver a world-class experience every time.
We know that some of our franchisees' economics are pressured, particularly in higher-wage markets. At the same time, others are overleveraged and some simply aren't the right operating partner for us to grow this brand. We know this transition won't be easy, but we are committed to doing the right thing for this iconic brand over the long term. To be clear, we have many existing Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that have the capital, commitment and capability to bring the brand to life the right way, and we will continue to support and partner with them on the brand turnaround. Of course, this transition will undoubtedly lead to some disruption and choppiness in the short term, and I'm confident that Artie and his team are set to tackle this head on.
Now you want to leave a business better than you found it but also with the knowledge it'll be better after you're gone, and that's exactly how I feel today. We have accelerated growth while simultaneously executing a major transformation. And now nothing will give me more pleasure than to watch our brands and each of our employee and franchise partners go from strength to strength.
When I got the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Yum! starting in 2015, the goal was to lead our culture to fuel results and continue to build brands that people trust and champion while driving aggressive unit expansion. This has always been and remains a foundational pillar for me. We then built on this foundation with the separation of Yum! China in October 2016, which was the starting point of our 3-year transformation. We became maniacal about being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to generate more growth and create a world with more Yum!.
We're confident we're well on the way to accomplishing our 2016 transformation goals. We completed our refranchising program and are 98% franchised. We have demonstrated financial discipline by meeting our goal of G&A being 1.7% of system sales and by reducing run rate CapEx. We're on track to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases between 2017 and 2019, and we've generated over 80% total shareholder return since we announced the transformation. 
Additionally, we closed creative and transformative deals to drive profitable system sales growth for Yum! and our franchisees for years to come. We have achieved healthy same-store sales, and our pace of net new unit growth has nearly doubled since we announced our transformation in 2016. 
Our work is not finished, but I'm extremely proud, and I believe the Yum! family is equally proud of what we have accomplished. And we're even more excited about our future growth potential. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Chris Turner."

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and our remaining transformation initiatives. 
To begin, the results. Core operating profit grew 6%, and as Greg mentioned, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution with 3% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 8% system sales growth in the quarter. Similarly, Taco Bell had another great quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% for both same-store sales and net new unit growth. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses from marking to market our Grubhub investment. 
We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements is now a $0.12 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecasts which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.02 tailwind, and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.14 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.57. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the third quarter. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged. For reference, details of our guidance are available on our website in the Investors section.
Regarding our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period, 2017 through 2019, remains firmly on track. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $174 million at an average price per share below $115. When combined with dividends, we've already returned $6 billion toward our target $6.5 billion to $7 billion. 
Last but certainly not least, some updates on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Elevating our customer experience with digital and technology at the forefront is key to growing our brands. To that end, Clay Johnson has joined us as Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer, or CDTO; and Gavin Felder will be promoted to Yum! Chief Strategy Officer effective December 1. These newly created leadership positions will report to me and partner with our brands to accelerate global growth through technology and disruptive innovation. 
Clay has over 20 years of industry experience and comes to us from Walmart where he served as CIO. In his new role as CDTO, Clay will oversee Yum!'s global technology strategy, partnering with our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Divisions. He will lead a coordinated cross-brand effort to accelerate Yum!'s digital commerce strategy, data and analytics and emerging technologies to enhance the customer and employee experience. Additionally, he will provide strategic oversight to our global technology risk management and IT Shared Services teams. These critical connections will ensure that our technology implementations are developed with the security of our data and infrastructure as a top priority. 
As Chief Strategy Officer, Gavin will be responsible for developing Yum! Brands' long-term corporate strategies and partnering closely with the global brand divisions to implement initiatives to unlock new sources of growth and disruptive innovation. He will work closely with Clay to integrate technology-centric solutions across store operations, including restaurant technology strategies to elevate the customer and team member experience. Gavin is a successful digital leader and proven growth strategist. He started nearly 12 years ago in Yum! Restaurants International as a finance manager before becoming CFO of KFC Africa and later CFO of KFC Global. In his current role, Gavin has overseen strategy, digital and technology, financial planning, supply chain and IT security of our largest global brand. 
With that, I'll hand it off to our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,639984583,1844945,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. We'll conclude our call today with an update on our growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. I'll start with our R.E.D.",2066,"Thank you, Chris. We'll conclude our call today with an update on our growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
I'll start with our R.E.D. brands. KFC delivered its 17th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. This global powerhouse continues to show broad-based strength from standout -- with standout performances across many of our largest markets. This translated into division system sales growth of 8% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 6%. 
International callouts include India, SOPAC, Latin America and our Russia business unit, which includes Central and Eastern Europe. 
India delivered 7% same-store sales growth driven by distinctive marketing, promotion of the Zinger burger and consistent value with the Ultimate Savings Bucket. 
Australia continued to impress with 8% same-store sales growth, their best quarter in recent history. Drivers included the successful Hot Rods promotion and delivery. 
Russia, Central and Eastern Europe posted a strong 7% same-store sales growth owing to a Bucket for 1 value promotion and the finger lickin' good spin on a taco, Locos Tacos. 
In the U.S., same-store sales declined 1% in the quarter. We had a temporary loss of momentum with the Cheetos sandwich promotion which led to the quarter's decline. However, our value promotion of 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match provided us with a new channel for a la carte menu items, and the quarter brought us many valuable insights to improve future performance. 
We made a splash with plant-based fried chicken alternatives with Beyond Nuggets and Beyond Boneless Wings. The results were very positive. We sold out in 5 hours and generated $2 billion worth of media impressions -- 2 billion media impressions. 
Then at the end of the quarter, we launched Mac & Cheese Bowls, which builds off of flavors you've already seen but packaged in a unique KFC style. We're bullish on the future and are excited about our plans for the rest of 2019 and beyond.
In addition, KFC U.S. continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivery and click-and-collect. We officially launched online ordering at KFC.com on October 13 in conjunction with the introduction of Kentucky Fried Wings and our Rudy-inspired advertising. We now have 2,700 KFCs offering delivery and 3,700 restaurants available for click-and-collect. We're excited about owning our own digital channel and the operation ease this provides our franchisees while Grubhub takes care of the delivery. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut where division system sales grew 7% with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 9%. Pizza Hut International system sales grew 14% in the quarter driven by a 9-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 1%. 
Importantly, we reported positive system sales growth across all international business units during the quarter. In addition, we were encouraged by 3% same-store sales growth in the off-premise segment of our businesses this quarter, lapping similar 3% growth last year or 6% on a 2-year basis. The team's focus on the fundamentals of a modern delivery experience is clearly producing results and a good sign for the future of this business as we migrate more and more to an asset base positioned to win in off-premise. In addition, the system sales growth gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales narrowed from historical levels this quarter to 3 points, reducing the drag on our performance from dine-in. 
In the U.S., system sales declined 2% with same-store sales declining 3% and a 1% net new unit decline. Coming off a solid second quarter, the Pizza Hut U.S. business decelerated in Q3 as changes to our value offerings helped franchisee margins but had a negative impact on transactions. In addition, our previously announced plans to accelerate the transition to a modern delivery asset base in the U.S. while restructuring and upgrading our franchisee base also took a toll on performance.
While we strongly believe that these are the right strategies to build the business for the longer term, these moves will introduce some uncertainty in the business performance over the short term as we expect results to continue to be choppy. We caution we could see a continuation of soft sales and unit contraction throughout 2020 in the Pizza Hut U.S. business. Of course, we know that when we have great franchise operators running first-class assets that are well positioned in trade areas to serve customers, we win in the marketplace, and the Pizza Hut U.S. team is working hard to accelerate this transition.
We continue to expand our Grubhub partnership test with Pizza Hut, which is now active in over 700 restaurants. Pizza Hut is well positioned to leverage being listed on the Grubhub Marketplace but by fulfilling delivery orders through our own delivery network. This gives us better control of the customer experience.
Last but not least, Taco Bell, where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 4%. In the U.S., innovation and value continue to be cornerstones of our success. Promotions included Steak Reaper Ranch Fries and the return of the Triple Double Crunchwrap, both of which mixed above 9%. But the Triple Double was the standout of the quarter, available in a $5 box and a la carte. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 6,100 restaurants, and we launched localized AI-driven product recommendations to efficiently give our customers what they want. Kiosk results are encouraging with consistent check lift and utilization. We see particularly strong consumer appeal in urban markets. In fact, in Manhattan, kiosk utilization is over 50% at our Company Cantinas. Digital menu boards are offered in over 1,000 locations with a new, simplified menu. Delivery is now live in 4,800 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 14 million registered users. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app.
Internationally, we continue to build a Category of One brand. We had strong sales momentum around the world, driven by focus on iconic core products, value boxes at power price points and product innovation. We saw widespread strength in the Philippines, Japan, Canada and Europe. We continue to strengthen global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. The U.K. ran a Steal a Base, Steal a Taco promotion tied to the Major League Baseball London Series, generating strong media buzz and sales momentum.
Next, on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 389 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,876, excluding the Telepizza units added in fourth quarter of last year. At KFC, development continued to be strong in Q3 with 317 net new units across 52 countries. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Thailand. In the U.S., we've seen more positive momentum and closed out Q3 with over 1,800 American Showman restaurants across the country.
At Pizza Hut, as we transition the U.S. asset base, we expect the pace of new unit development for the division to decelerate as healthy international unit growth will be offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. All in, the division opened 17 net new units during the quarter. Pizza Hut International opened 76 net new units with noteworthy contributions from Asia, Latin America and Iberia.
Taco Bell delivered 55 net new units during the quarter. In the U.S., we opened 4 new Urban-style Cantina restaurants, hitting the 50-restaurant milestone. Recent Urban Cantina openings include Chicago, San Jose, Champaign and Fort Lauderdale. Internationally, Thailand launched its third store, which is the first outside expat communities in Bangkok. And China and Australia each opened their fifth location. We're continuing to build franchise development capability through events such as a development convention in Guatemala, a 4-day event covering development principles and best practices to foster 3C partners around the world.
Next, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. First, I'd like to highlight the great visit the executive team and myself had with Joey Wat and the Yum! China team earlier this month. We were excited to learn about the work they're doing to lead innovation across many aspects of their business. And as always, we were incredibly impressed with their operational execution and overall focus on putting the customer first across all our brands. 
At KFC, we've seen solid improvements across the board, sharing proven ideas and global best practices when it comes to ops-driven sales enablers. This is particularly the case when it comes to speed. Our franchisees in SOPAC created a competitive speed initiative called Fast Friday, which was then adopted by the U.K. to great success. 
At Taco Bell, we're proud to announce this was our fastest Q3 in 5 years, which wouldn't have been possible without the commitment from over -- from our over 7,000 general managers and their teams to deliver unrivaled, fast and friendly service. Our Summer Speed Challenge was a huge driver of this success. We were 17 seconds faster and saw 3 million more cars in our drive-thrus.
At Pizza Hut, we have successfully improved our system average delivery speed, which allows us to deliver hotter pizzas faster to our customers' door. While technology and data science have unlocked key insight, the credit goes to our restaurant leaders and drivers who have implemented these tactics at the store level to provide a Hot, Fast and Reliable experience for our delivery customers.
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Yum!'s 2 biggest assets are our brands and our people. As we build the world's most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands, our culture continues to be a strength and is a key enabler of our continued success. We recently completed our 2019 employee engagement survey of all corporate above-restaurant employees globally, and we scored #1 on employee engagement among an elite benchmark of over 300 global companies. 95% of the corporate employees surveyed are proud to work at Yum! and 91% believe our company is a great place to work. What's even more encouraging is that we have accomplished these results during a time of significant business transformation.
I'd like to finish by saying how excited I am and privileged I am to serve as the next CEO of Yum!. Under Greg's leadership, we have achieved so much already. Of course, there is still more we can achieve in the future. Everywhere we operate, we need to continue elevating and investing in a world-class customer experience with unrivaled talent, modern assets and the best operations with disruptive and innovative technology. This effort will only be realized through a strong partnership with our 2,000 franchisees who run our restaurants and over 1.5 million restaurant team members who bring our brands to life around the world every day. When we are at our best, we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Before we take your questions, I want to personally thank Greg for his tremendous leadership. As we all know, Greg's been making meaningful contributions to Yum! for the past 25 years. He's been fully committed to developing our talent, increasing our collaboration, elevating our brands and growing our business. Yet most importantly, Greg's vision to take Yum!'s unique recognition culture and use it to fuel even better results is what we will all remember. It goes without saying that Greg's big personality and positive energy make him not only a great leader but also one of the best partners and friends I could have had over the last many years. There's no question that working with Greg day in and day out has helped prepare me for this next role and also given me a ton of laughs along the way. It's hard to believe that this will be Greg's last earnings call. 
On behalf of the entire Yum! system, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact that he has made to our business. And we wish Greg and his wife, Carolyn, the very best as they move into this new, exciting chapter.
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

The -- can we just talk about -- a little bit about the Pizza Hut business and sort of your outlook? One, you talked about some disruption that may be possible during this period of time. Can you just be specific about that? Is that just sort of lower engagement on franchisee as starting to be closing stores? Or what is the nature of that? 
Two, is there an opportunity for the company again to sort of step in either as an intermediary or as -- provide some temporary support from advertising? And some way to smooth this process better? Because I think as you look out over 12 months, you want to avoid obviously a disruption. 
And three, I think there was a callout on the profits of the Pizza Hut business U.S., a drag or detraction from past due receivables. How big is that? And is that something we need to be cognizant of as we think about the next year or so? And does it impact the global core operating profit growth?"

As far as your 3 different questions, I'll take the first 2, and we'll let Chris talk a little bit about the receivables.
As far as the disruption, as you can imagine, when we're closing a lot of stores and opening new stores, that can be an enormous distraction, particularly if we're taking the lead on transitioning franchisees out of the system and their stores into the hands of new players. Some of that will get to the receivables which Chris will talk about. And also while transactions are taking place, obviously, there's a focus issue in terms of where a franchisee's focus is. 
As far as the company stepping in and playing an active role in some of this, I wouldn't rule that out, but that's certainly not the plan now. The great thing about the Pizza Hut U.S. business is we have plenty of people that want to get into it and are eager to buy stores and invest capital into fixing those stores and relocating them. So we see our role as more of a facilitator than we do as somebody to be buying stores, given our asset-light model. But I do think there probably -- there could be an opportunity at different points in time for us to take control of some stores as they transition to another party if that's a better way to approach it. So I wouldn't rule that out. 
And then I'll let Chris just talk about the receivables."

As David just mentioned, we are working to evolve that Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee base, and you did see noted that the past due receivables balances did have an impact. But to kind of put it in context, as we transition certain Pizza Hut franchisees, we will see an uptick in that bad debt. 
But again, to put it in context, year-to-date, we have recorded about $200 million in fee income from our U.S. franchise system. And over 95% of that, we have either collected or anticipate collecting. Obviously, we'll try to minimize the choppiness as we go through this process, but we do believe that the work that we're doing will ultimately be the right thing to strengthen the brand and the overall system."

First, we do have the team in place now, both strong technology leadership in each of our brands and geographies, and then the new additions that we mentioned earlier at the center and Clay Johnson supported by Gavin Felder. Obviously for competitive reasons, we can't go into a lot of detail on our future strategies. But just to give a little bit of color, I think there are probably 3 ways that we could advance technology. 
One would be evaluating and considering potential acquisitions or investments in technology companies to help leverage our scale, bring those technologies to our stores and our  franchisees. Second could be commercial arrangements that we make with technology providers that give our franchisees advantaged economics in taking advantage of those technologies. And then third, given the strength of our team, we'll be developing internally proprietary technologies. 
So those would be the 3 ways that we can leverage scale in this area. The areas that we'll be hunting in range across the full technology spectrum, but e-commerce, data and analytics and any innovations that improve the customer experience and the economics in our stores will clearly be at the forefront."

Secondly, you've obviously made some fairly cautious total unit count comments around Pizza Hut. Just want to get a little bit more clarification there. 
And then on Taco Bell, I think the comments were, in the press release, 67 gross units in 13 countries. It's hard to drive scale at those kind of numbers internationally, but are we at the point now where Taco Bell can materially accelerate into 2020? And I'd like a follow-up as well."

We've raised our guidance previously to 4% net new unit growth. We still think that's a right longer -- number for the long term. As we've highlighted on the last earnings call, with leaning in on Pizza Hut, that introduced a little bit more uncertainty into the pace of development. But we still think over the next few years we will average that 4% unit growth number. 
As far as Taco Bell, that's actually one of the areas that I think we're most excited about, what's going on in international. We by choice focused on a few countries to try to get the pace of development really going in those countries. So you highlight that it's 13 countries, but when you get a franchisee that signed up to build 600 units in India, obviously that can make a meaningful step-change to the pace of our development at Taco Bell internationally, to just pick 1 example. But we will be expanding to additional countries over time. But I think we're really at the point where Taco Bell International development can start to become a more meaningful contributor to us. 
And then as far as KFC maintaining their lofty pace of development, we see no reason why that can't continue. And the strength of that brand is something that I would just highlight for everybody on this earnings call. It just continues to be widespread strength with clear brand positioning, a team that's really energized about the growth prospects ahead of us and absolutely believe in the -- our ability to continue to grow and develop and accelerate the pace of KFC development."

As far as the Pizza Hut business, I wanted to make sure we all recognize that the Pizza Hut International business is performing quite well, starting to really deliver on some of the things that we've been looking for out of that business in terms of moving to a modern delivery asset base. We talked about in the earnings -- in the script the fact that they're plus 6% on off-premise sales; on a 2-year basis, plus 3%, lapping a 3%. All of that is a really good sign in terms of the strength of the Pizza Hut brand when it's executed by -- in the market. 
The Pizza Hut U.S. business, as we've talked about also previously, has some unique challenges given the dine-in, the estate and the condition of the assets, the location of those assets. So that's what we're trying to address by moving to a more modern delivery estate and setting the business up for long-term health. Unfortunately, a lot of franchisees or some franchisees have some debt that makes it hard to relocate those assets, and that's what we're working through with those parties, to get the stores in the hands of the right partners that are well capitalized to grow and build the business. 
It's not the majority of our franchisees. The majority of our franchisees are good partners and doing a nice job. But as you know, the QSR category is facing a lot of wage pressures right now, and that is pressuring unit-level economics and franchisees' economics. But as we always remind people, building a new Pizza Hut is a good investment. The unit economics stand on theirselves. This is more about working through with a select group of franchisees that may have more debt on their business than they should, to get those stores capitalized properly and in the right hands of the right partners."

So that was the first part question. 
And then the second was just a quick one on KFC and the Beyond Nuggets and the extent to which you view this as sort of sustainable versus a short-term very healthy lift, but maybe less of a core part of the menu."

I guess on the question of aggregators, obviously, we value our partnership with Grubhub. And one of the key features of that partnership, to your point, Sara, is that we integrated the technologies so that the orders get passed directly into our POS systems. That wasn't easy. That was part of the reason there was a delay in launch, but we think that does give us a true competitive advantage over a lot of other people that are working with aggregators. So we haven't really had issues that you're alluding to in terms of being able to get the orders to the stores accurately and then back out to the customer. And I think that's why it's working so well.
As far as KFC and Beyond Nuggets, obviously, we're all intrigued by plant-based meat alternatives. And the success that we did with Beyond -- the success of that test that we did with Beyond obviously is a good sign. We've done other tests around the world. That's not the only one that we've done. It's the one that's garnered the most press in the U.S. So you can expect more to come on that front. You saw just a couple of weeks ago, Pizza Hut launched -- in the U.S., launched their compostable box and did so with a plant-based alternative meat topping. So we think there's plenty of application for it, but more to come on that over time."

Look, I think we're all excited that we're coming out of this transformation with a business that is stronger and better positioned to grow. That's to start. And that is very much due to Greg's leadership over the last 5 years, as I said in my prepared remarks. 
Now that we've got a better machine, we'd like to drive faster and grow faster. And I'll detail a lot of this as we get into 2020, but just to give you a preview. We've talked about this Recipe for Growth and how it's been fueling our growth over the last couple of years. I think there's an opportunity to lean in further within the Recipe for Growth on the customer experience. 
We are not consistently executing the customer experience around the world to the standards that we have. We have pockets of excellence, we can be more consistent on that. There's obviously an opportunity on technology which Chris talked about. And then there's an opportunity to better leverage our scale. I think now that we are more of a franchisor, less of an equity operator, that gives us the ability to turn our focus to leveraging the scale on behalf of the entire system. We're organized in a better way to do that. I think you're seeing more collaboration around the world, again, thanks to Greg's leadership and dialing up the collaboration. All of that leads to an opportunity on scale. I do think that potentially could be something that would give us a benefit if we did an acquisition. So we don't need an acquisition to grow. Our brands today are strong generally around the world with plenty of growth opportunities, but we certainly wouldn't rule out an acquisition. 
I think the other thing that you'll see us talk about is we've talked a lot about the Recipe for Growth. At the same time, we've had what we call our Recipe for Good that our businesses are doing all around the world in their communities, around people, planet and food. We'll talk more about that as we get into 2020 and the way we can dial up our communication on that and our efforts in that area."

Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call. 
Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation for today's call. First, all system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, Pizza Hut Division and worldwide system sales and net new unit growth include the benefit of the increase in units in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our strategic alliance with Telepizza. Same-store sales growth reflects the inclusion of Telepizza in the prior year base. Third, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. 
Fourth, the lease accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1, 2019. As a reminder, this is a GAAP-required change resulting in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We do not expect a change in our income statement or cash flows as a result of this accounting change. And last, please note that 2019 results will include a 53rd week. 
We're broadcasting this call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both the live conference and in any future use of the recording.

Following a very strong first half and in line with our expectations, third quarter results were healthy and consistent with our long-term growth model. Yum! delivered third quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 3% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. While we're pleased with our results, we know there is always work to be done. 
I'd like to begin today's call with a few opening remarks before I hand it over to Chris, who will go over our third quarter results and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss our 4 growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinct Brands, or as we say, R.E.D. for short; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and then some additional news on culture and Talent. 
Now to start at the top. I'm confident that the Board and I have identified the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth for Yum!. We're delighted that David will officially take over as CEO in January. David has been a fantastic partner to me throughout our transformation these past few years. We've always shared an unwavering belief in people, their development and our culture and will continue to invest in making Yum! the best place to work.
I'm also immensely proud of the progress we've made by making both the Taco Bell and the KFC brands R.E.D. and accelerating the pace of global unit development. But there is always unfinished business, and for us, that unfinished business includes consistently enhancing the customer experience by ensuring that we have the best people, technology and assets. And this unfinished business is probably most pronounced at Pizza Hut U.S. 
I'm proud of Artie Starrs and his team as they continue to make significant progress on many aspects of the turnaround of this business, such as enhancing product quality, improving the speed of service, introducing a loyalty program and upgrading our technology over the past few years. And as we announced last quarter, they're leaning in to accelerate the transition of our asset base to one with modern delivery/carryout assets while also moving aggressively to evolve our franchisee base so that we can deliver a world-class experience every time.
We know that some of our franchisees' economics are pressured, particularly in higher-wage markets. At the same time, others are overleveraged and some simply aren't the right operating partner for us to grow this brand. We know this transition won't be easy, but we are committed to doing the right thing for this iconic brand over the long term. To be clear, we have many existing Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that have the capital, commitment and capability to bring the brand to life the right way, and we will continue to support and partner with them on the brand turnaround. Of course, this transition will undoubtedly lead to some disruption and choppiness in the short term, and I'm confident that Artie and his team are set to tackle this head on.
Now you want to leave a business better than you found it but also with the knowledge that it'll be better after you're gone, and that's exactly how I feel today. We have accelerated growth while simultaneously executing a major transformation. And now nothing will give me more pleasure than to watch our brands and each of our employee and franchise partners go from strength to strength.
When I got the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Yum! starting in 2015, the goal was to lead our culture to fuel results and continue to build brands that people trust and champion while driving aggressive unit expansion. This has always been and remains a foundational pillar for me. We then built on this foundation with the separation of Yum China in October 2016, which was the starting point of our 3-year transformation. We became maniacal about being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to generate more growth and create a world with more Yum!.
We're confident we're well on the way to accomplishing our 2016 transformation goals. We completed our refranchising program and are 98% franchised. We have demonstrated financial discipline by meeting our goal of G&A being 1.7% of system sales and by reducing run rate CapEx. We're on track to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases between 2017 and 2019, and we've generated over 80% total shareholder return since we announced the transformation. 
Additionally, we closed creative and transformative deals to drive profitable system sales growth for Yum! and our franchisees for years to come. We have achieved healthy same-store sales, and our pace of net new unit growth has nearly doubled since we announced our transformation in 2016. 
Our work is not finished, but I'm extremely proud, and I believe the Yum! family is equally proud of what we have accomplished. And we're even more excited about our future growth potential. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Chris Turner."

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and our remaining transformation initiatives. To begin, the results. Core operating profit grew 6%, and as Greg mentioned, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 8",822,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and our remaining transformation initiatives. 
To begin, the results. Core operating profit grew 6%, and as Greg mentioned, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 3% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 8% system sales growth in the quarter. Similarly, Taco Bell had another great quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% for both same-store sales and net new unit growth. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses from marking to market our Grubhub investment. 
We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements is now a $0.12 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecasts which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.02 tailwind, and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.14 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.57. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the third quarter. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged. For reference, details of our guidance are available on our website in the Investors section.
Regarding our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $174 million at an average price per share below $115. When combined with dividends, we've already returned $6 billion toward our target $6.5 billion to $7 billion. 
Last but certainly not least, some updates on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Elevating our customer experience with digital and technology at the forefront is key to growing our brands. To that end, Clay Johnson has joined us as Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer, or CDTO; and Gavin Felder will be promoted to Yum! Chief Strategy Officer effective December 1. These newly created leadership positions will report to me and partner with our brands to accelerate global growth through technology and disruptive innovation. 
Clay has over 20 years of industry experience and comes to us from Walmart where he served as CIO. In his new role as CDTO, Clay will oversee Yum!'s global technology strategy, partnering with our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Divisions. He will lead a coordinated cross-brand effort to accelerate Yum!'s digital commerce strategy, data and analytics and emerging technologies to enhance the customer and employee experience. Additionally, he will provide strategic oversight to our global technology risk management and IT shared services teams. These critical connections will ensure that our technology implementations are developed with the security of our data and infrastructure as a top priority. 
As Chief Strategy Officer, Gavin will be responsible for developing Yum! Brands' long-term corporate strategies and partnering closely with the global brand divisions to implement initiatives to unlock new sources of growth and disruptive innovation. He will work closely with Clay to integrate technology-centric solutions across store operations, including restaurant technology strategies to elevate the customer and team member experience. Gavin is a successful digital leader and proven growth strategist. He started nearly 12 years ago in Yum! Restaurants International as a finance manager before becoming CFO of KFC Africa and later CFO of KFC Global. In his current role, Gavin has overseen strategy, digital and technology, financial planning, supply chain and IT security of our largest global brand. 
With that, I'll hand it off to our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,639984583,1845023,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. We'll conclude our call today with an update on our growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. I'll start with our R.E.D",2066,"Thank you, Chris. We'll conclude our call today with an update on our growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
I'll start with our R.E.D. brands. KFC delivered its 17th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. This global powerhouse continues to show broad-based strength from standout -- with standout performances across many of our largest markets. This translated into division system sales growth of 8% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 6%. 
International callouts include India, SOPAC, Latin America and our Russia business unit, which includes Central and Eastern Europe. India delivered 7% same-store sales growth driven by distinctive marketing, promotion of the Zinger Burger and consistent value with the Ultimate Savings Bucket. Australia continued to impress with 8% same-store sales growth, their best quarter in recent history. Drivers included the successful Hot Rods promotion and delivery. 
Russia, Central and Eastern Europe posted a strong 7% same-store sales growth owing to a Bucket for 1 value promotion and the finger lickin' good spin on a taco, Locos Tacos. 
In the U.S., same-store sales declined 1% in the quarter. We had a temporary loss of momentum with the Cheetos sandwich promotion which led to the quarter's decline. However, our value promotion of 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match provided us with a new channel for a la carte menu items, and the quarter brought us many valuable insights to improve future performance. 
We made a splash with plant-based fried chicken alternatives with Beyond nuggets and Beyond boneless wings. The results were very positive. We sold out in 5 hours and generated $2 billion worth of media impressions -- 2 billion media impressions. 
Then at the end of the quarter, we launched Mac & Cheese Bowls, which builds off of flavors you've already seen but packaged in a unique KFC style. We're bullish on the future and are excited about our plans for the rest of 2019 and beyond.
In addition, KFC U.S. continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivery and click-and-collect. We officially launched online ordering at KFC.com on October 13 in conjunction with the introduction of Kentucky Fried Wings and our Rudy-inspired advertising. We now have 2,700 KFCs offering delivery and 3,700 restaurants available for click-and-collect. We're excited about owning our own digital channel and the operation ease this provides our franchisees while Grubhub takes care of the delivery. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut where division system sales grew 7% with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 9%. Pizza Hut International system sales grew 14% in the quarter driven by a 9-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 1%. 
Importantly, we reported positive system sales growth across all international business units during the quarter. In addition, we were encouraged by 3% same-store sales growth in the off-premise segment of our businesses this quarter, lapping similar 3% growth last year or 6% on a 2-year basis. The team's focus on the fundamentals of a modern delivery experience is clearly producing results and a good sign for the future of this business as we migrate more and more to an asset base positioned to win in off-premise. In addition, the system sales growth gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales narrowed from historical levels this quarter to 3 points, reducing the drag on our performance from dine-in. 
In the U.S., system sales declined 2% with same-store sales declining 3% and a 1% net new unit decline. Coming off a solid second quarter, the Pizza Hut U.S. business decelerated in Q3 as changes to our value offerings helped franchisee margins but had a negative impact on transactions. In addition, our previously announced plans to accelerate the transition to a modern delivery asset base in the U.S. while restructuring and upgrading our franchisee base also took a toll on performance.
While we strongly believe that these are the right strategies to build the business for the longer term, these moves will introduce some uncertainty in the business performance over the short term as we expect results to continue to be choppy. We caution we could see a continuation of soft sales and unit contraction throughout 2020 in the Pizza Hut U.S. business. Of course, we know that when we have great franchise operators running first-class assets that are well positioned in trade areas to serve customers, we win in the marketplace, and the Pizza Hut U.S. team is working hard to accelerate this transition.
We continue to expand our Grubhub partnership test with Pizza Hut, which is now active in over 700 restaurants. Pizza Hut is well positioned to leverage being listed on the Grubhub marketplace but by fulfilling delivery orders through our own delivery network. This gives us better control of the customer experience.
Last but not least, Taco Bell, where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 4%. In the U.S., innovation and value continue to be cornerstones of our success. Promotions included Steak Reaper Ranch Fries and the return of the Triple Double Crunchwrap, both of which mixed above 9%. But the Triple Double was the standout of the quarter, available in a $5 box and a la carte. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 6,100 restaurants, and we launched localized AI-driven product recommendations to efficiently give our customers what they want. Kiosk results are encouraging with consistent check lift and utilization. We see particularly strong consumer appeal in urban markets. In fact, in Manhattan, kiosk utilization is over 50% at our Company Cantinas. 
Digital menu boards are offered in over 1,000 locations with a new, simplified menu. Delivery is now live in 4,800 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 14 million registered users. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app.
Internationally, we continue to build a Category of One brand. We had strong sales momentum around the world, driven by focus on iconic core products, value boxes at power price points and product innovation. We saw widespread strength in the Philippines, Japan, Canada and Europe. We continue to strengthen global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. The U.K. ran a Steal a Base, Steal a Taco promotion tied to the Major League Baseball London series, generating strong media buzz and sales momentum.  
Next, on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 389 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,876, excluding the Telepizza units added in fourth quarter of last year. At KFC, development continued to be strong in Q3 with 317 net new units across 52 countries. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Thailand. In the U.S., we've seen more positive momentum and closed out Q3 with over 1,800 American Showman restaurants across the country.
At Pizza Hut, as we transition the U.S. asset base, we expect the pace of new unit development for the division to decelerate as healthy international unit growth will be offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. All in, the division opened 17 net new units during the quarter. Pizza Hut International opened 76 net new units with noteworthy contributions from Asia, Latin America and Iberia.
Taco Bell delivered 55 net new units during the quarter. In the U.S., we opened 4 new Urban-style Cantina restaurants, hitting the 50-restaurant milestone. Recent Urban Cantina openings include Chicago, San Jose, Champaign and Fort Lauderdale. Internationally, Thailand launched its third store, which is the first outside expat communities in Bangkok. And China and Australia each opened their fifth location. We're continuing to build franchise development capability through events such as a development convention in Guatemala, a 4-day event covering development principles and best practices to foster 3C partners around the world.
Next, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. First, I'd like to highlight the great visit the executive team and myself had with Joey Wat and the Yum China team earlier this month. We were excited to learn about the work they're doing to lead innovation across many aspects of their business. And as always, we were incredibly impressed with their operational execution and overall focus on putting the customer first across all our brands. 
At KFC, we've seen solid improvements across the board, sharing proven ideas and global best practices when it comes to ops-driven sales enablers. This is particularly the case when it comes to speed. Our franchisees in SOPAC created a competitive speed initiative called Fast Friday, which was then adopted by the U.K. to great success. 
At Taco Bell, we're proud to announce this was our fastest Q3 in 5 years, which wouldn't have been possible without the commitment from over -- from our over 7,000 general managers and their teams to deliver unrivaled, fast and friendly service. Our Summer Speed Challenge was a huge driver of this success. We were 17 seconds faster and saw 3 million more cars in our drive-thrus.
At Pizza Hut, we have successfully improved our system average delivery speed, which allows us to deliver hotter pizzas faster to our customers' door. While technology and data science have unlocked key insight, the credit goes to our restaurant leaders and drivers who have implemented these tactics at the store level to provide a Hot, Fast and Reliable experience for our delivery customers.
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Yum!'s 2 biggest assets are our brands and our people. As we build the world's most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands, our culture continues to be a strength and is a key enabler of our continued success. We recently completed our 2019 employee engagement survey of all corporate above-restaurant employees globally, and we scored #1 on employee engagement among an elite benchmark of over 300 global companies. 95% of the corporate employees surveyed are proud to work at Yum! and 91% believe our company is a great place to work. What's even more encouraging is that we have accomplished these results during a time of significant business transformation.
I'd like to finish by saying how excited I am and privileged I am to serve as the next CEO of Yum!. Under Greg's leadership, we have achieved so much already. Of course, there is still more we can achieve in the future. Everywhere we operate, we need to continue elevating and investing in a world-class customer experience with unrivaled talent, modern assets and the best operations with disruptive and innovative technology. This effort will only be realized through a strong partnership with our 2,000 franchisees who run our restaurants and over 1.5 million restaurant team members who bring our brands to life around the world every day. When we are at our best, we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Before we take your questions, I want to personally thank Greg for his tremendous leadership. As we all know, Greg's been making meaningful contributions to Yum! for the past 25 years. He's been fully committed to developing our talent, increasing our collaboration, elevating our brands and growing our business. Yet most importantly, Greg's vision to take Yum!'s unique recognition culture and use it to fuel even better results is what we will all remember. It goes without saying that Greg's big personality and positive energy make him not only a great leader but also one of the best partners and friends I could have had over the last many years. There's no question that working with Greg day in and day out has helped prepare me for this next role and also given me a ton of laughs along the way. It's hard to believe that this will be Greg's last earnings call. 
On behalf of the entire Yum! system, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact that he has made to our business. And we wish Greg and his wife, Carolyn, the very best as they move into this new exciting chapter.
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

The -- can we just talk about -- a little bit about the Pizza Hut business and sort of your outlook? One, you talked about some disruption that may be possible during this period of time. Can you just be specific about that? Is that just sort of lower engagement on franchisees as some would be closing stores? Or what is the nature of that? 
Two, is there an opportunity for the company again to sort of step in either as an intermediary or as -- provide some temporary support from advertising and some way to smooth this process better? Because I think as you look out over 12 months, you want to avoid obviously a disruption. 
And three, I think there was a callout on the profits of the Pizza Hut business U.S., a drag or detraction from past due receivables. How big is that? And is that something we need to be cognizant of as we think about the next year or so? And does it impact the global core operating profit growth?"

As far as your 3 different questions, I'll take the first 2, and we'll let Chris talk a little bit about the receivables.  
As far as the disruption, as you can imagine, when we're closing a lot of stores and opening new stores, that can be an enormous distraction, particularly if we're taking the lead on transitioning franchisees out of the system and their stores into the hands of new players. Some of that will get to the receivables which Chris will talk about. And also while transactions are taking place, obviously, there's a focus issue in terms of where a franchisee's focus is. 
As far as the company stepping in and playing an active role in some of this, I wouldn't rule that out, but that's certainly not the plan now. The great thing about the Pizza Hut U.S. business is we have plenty of people that want to get into it and are eager to buy stores and invest capital into fixing those stores and relocating them. So we see our role as more of a facilitator than we do as somebody to be buying stores, given our asset-light model. But I do think there probably -- there could be an opportunity at different points in time for us to take control of some stores as they transition to another party if that's a better way to approach it. So I wouldn't rule that out. 
And then I'll let Chris just talk a little bit about the receivables."

And our stores do perform the best when we have committed, capable and well-capitalized franchisees. As David just mentioned, we are working to evolve that Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee base, and you did see noted that the past due receivables balances did have an impact. But to kind of put it in context, as we transition certain Pizza Hut franchisees, we will see an uptick in that bad debt. 
But again, to put it in context, year-to-date, we have recorded about $200 million in fee income from our U.S. franchise system. And over 95% of that, we have either collected or anticipate collecting. Obviously, we'll try to minimize the choppiness as we go through this process, but we do believe that the work that we're doing will ultimately be the right thing to strengthen the brand and the overall system."

By bringing them in-house, we've been able to improve their capabilities and provide better services to our franchisees at lower cost. The deal with Grubhub has given us great commercial terms for our franchisees. And that's allowed us to uniformly launch delivery without having the pushback that I think others may have seen, both in Taco Bell and the KFC system.

Obviously for competitive reasons, we can't go into a lot of detail on our future strategies. But just to give a little bit of color, I think there are probably 3 ways that we could advance technology.  
One would be evaluating and considering potential acquisitions or investments in technology companies to help leverage our scale, bring those technologies to our stores and our franchisees. Second could be commercial arrangements that we make with technology providers that give our franchisees advantaged economics in taking advantage of those technologies. And then third, given the strength of our team, we'll be developing internally proprietary technologies. 
So those would be the 3 ways that we can leverage scale in this area. The areas that we'll be hunting in range across the full technology spectrum, but e-commerce, data and analytics and any innovations that improve the customer experience and the economics in our stores will clearly be at the forefront."

I think it's important at this point to kind of think about whether KFC can maintain or even accelerate its pace, is the first point. 
Secondly, you've obviously made some fairly cautious total unit count comments around Pizza Hut. Just want to get a little bit more clarification there. 
And then on Taco Bell, I think the comments were, in the press release, 67 gross units in 13 countries. It's hard to drive scale at those kind of numbers internationally, but are we at the point now where Taco Bell can materially accelerate into 2020? And I'd like a follow-up as well."

As far as Taco Bell, that's actually one of the areas that I think we're most excited about, what's going on in international. We by choice focused on a few countries to try to get the pace of development really going in those countries. So you highlight that it's 13 countries, but when you get a franchisee that signed up to build 600 units in India, obviously that can make a meaningful step-change to the pace of our development at Taco Bell internationally, to just pick 1 example. But we will be expanding to additional countries over time. But I think we're really at the point where Taco Bell International development can start to become a more meaningful contributor to us. 
And then as far as KFC maintaining their lofty pace of development, we see no reason why that can't continue. And the strength of that brand is something that I would just highlight for everybody on this earnings call. It just continues to be widespread strength with clear brand positioning, a team that's really energized about the growth prospects ahead of us and absolutely believe in the -- our ability to continue to grow and develop and accelerate the pace of KFC development."

Their bonds are trading cheap here. Margin pressure seems to be a key theme across that system.

As far as the Pizza Hut business, I wanted to make sure we all recognize that the Pizza Hut International business is performing quite well, starting to really deliver on some of the things that we've been looking for out of that business in terms of moving to a modern delivery asset base. We talked about in the earnings -- in the script the fact that they're plus 6% on off-premise sales on a 2-year basis, plus 3% lapping a 3%. All of that is a really good sign in terms of the strength of the Pizza Hut brand when it's executed by -- in the market. 
The Pizza Hut U.S. business, as we've talked about also previously, has some unique challenges given the dine-in, the estate and the condition of the assets, the location of those assets. So that's what we're trying to address by moving to a more modern delivery estate and setting the business up for long-term health. Unfortunately, a lot of franchisees or some franchisees have some debt that makes it hard to relocate those assets, and that's what we're working through with those parties, to get the stores in the hands of the right partners that are well capitalized to grow and build the business. 
It's not the majority of our franchisees. The majority of our franchisees are good partners and doing a nice job. But as you know, the QSR category is facing a lot of wage pressures right now, and that is pressuring unit-level economics and franchisees' economics. But as we always remind people, building a new Pizza Hut is a good investment. The unit economics stand on theirselves. This is more about working through with a select group of franchisees that may have more debt on their business than they should, to get those stores capitalized properly and in the right hands of the right partners."

And in particular, the extent to which some of -- sometimes, what we've seen is when restaurant companies kind of unlock different ordering channels, there are back of the house challenges and -- just because the production capacities maybe don't quite keep up with how the orders come in. So that was the first part -- question. 
And then the second was just a quick one on KFC and the Beyond nuggets and the extent to which you view this as sort of sustainable versus a short-term very healthy lift, but maybe less of a core part of the menu."

I guess on the question of aggregators, obviously, we value our partnership with Grubhub. And one of the key features of that partnership, to your point, Sara, is that we integrated the technologies so that the orders get passed directly into our POS systems. That wasn't easy. That was part of the reason there was a delay in launch, but we think that does give us a true competitive advantage over a lot of other people that are working with aggregators. So we haven't really had issues that you're alluding to in terms of being able to get the orders to the stores accurately and then back out to the customer. And I think that's why it's working so well.
As far as KFC and Beyond nuggets, obviously, we're all intrigued by plant-based meat alternatives. And the success that we did with Beyond -- the success of that test that we did with Beyond obviously is a good sign. We've done other tests around the world. That's not the only one that we've done. It's the one that's garnered the most press in the U.S. So you can expect more to come on that front. You saw just a couple of weeks ago, Pizza Hut launched -- in the U.S., launched their compostable box and did so with a plant-based alternative meat topping. So we think there's plenty of application for it, but more to come on that over time."

Look, I think we're all excited that we're coming out of this transformation with a business that is stronger and better positioned to grow. That's to start. And that is very much due to Greg's leadership over the last 5 years, as I said in my prepared remarks. 
Now that we've got a better machine, we'd like to drive faster and grow faster. And I'll detail a lot of this as we get into 2020, but just to give you a preview. We've talked about this Recipe for Growth and how it's been fueling our growth over the last couple of years. I think there's an opportunity to lean in further within the Recipe for Growth on the customer experience. 
We are not consistently executing the customer experience around the world to the standards that we have. We have pockets of excellence, we can be more consistent on that. There's obviously an opportunity on technology, which Chris talked about. And then there's an opportunity to better leverage our scale. I think now that we are more of a franchisor, less of an equity operator, that gives us the ability to turn our focus to leveraging the scale on behalf of the entire system. We're organized in a better way to do that. I think you're seeing more collaboration around the world, again, thanks to Greg's leadership in dialing up the collaboration. All of that leads to an opportunity on scale. I do think that potentially could be something that would give us a benefit if we did an acquisition. So we don't need an acquisition to grow. Our brands today are strong generally around the world with plenty of growth opportunities, but we certainly wouldn't rule out an acquisition. 
I think the other thing that you'll see us talk about is -- we've talked a lot about the Recipe for Growth. At the same time, we've had what we call our Recipe for Good that our businesses are doing all around the world in their communities, around people, planet and food. We'll talk more about that as we get into 2020 and the way we can dial up our communication on that and our efforts in that area."

All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call. 
Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation for today's call. First, all system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, Pizza Hut Division and worldwide system sales and net new unit growth include the benefit of the increase in units in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our strategic alliance with Telepizza. Same-store sales growth reflects the inclusion of Telepizza in the prior year base. Third, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. 
Fourth, the lease accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1, 2019. As a reminder, this is a GAAP-required change resulting in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We do not expect a change in our income statement or cash flows as a result of this accounting change. And last, please note that 2019 results will include a 53rd week.

Following a very strong first half and in line with our expectations, third quarter results were healthy and consistent with our long-term growth model. Yum! delivered third quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 3% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. While we're pleased with our results, we know there is always work to be done. 
I'd like to begin today's call with a few opening remarks before I hand it over to Chris, who will go over our third quarter results and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss our 4 growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinct Brands, or as we say, R.E.D. for short; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and then some additional news on culture and Talent. 
Now to start at the top. I'm confident that the Board and I have identified the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth for Yum!. We're delighted that David will officially take over as CEO in January. David has been a fantastic partner to me throughout our transformation these past few years. We've always shared an unwavering belief in people, their development and our culture and will continue to invest in making Yum! the best place to work.
I'm also immensely proud of the progress we've made by making both the Taco Bell and the KFC brands R.E.D. and accelerating the pace of global unit development. But there is always unfinished business, and for us, that unfinished business includes consistently enhancing the customer experience by ensuring that we have the best people, technology and assets. And this unfinished business is probably most pronounced at Pizza Hut U.S. 
I'm proud of Artie Starrs and his team as they continue to make significant progress on many aspects of the turnaround of this business, such as enhancing product quality, improving the speed of service, introducing a loyalty program and upgrading our technology over the past few years. And as we announced last quarter, they're leaning in to accelerate the transition of our asset base to one with modern delivery/carryout assets while also moving aggressively to evolve our franchisee base so that we can deliver a world-class experience every time.
We know that some of our franchisees' economics are pressured, particularly in higher-wage markets. At the same time, others are overleveraged and some simply aren't the right operating partner for us to grow this brand. We know this transition won't be easy, but we are committed to doing the right thing for this iconic brand over the long term. To be clear, we have many existing Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that have the capital, commitment and capability to bring the brand to life the right way, and we will continue to support and partner with them on the brand turnaround. Of course, this transition will undoubtedly lead to some disruption and choppiness in the short term, and I'm confident that Artie and his team are set to tackle this head on.
Now you want to leave a business better than you found it but also with the knowledge that it'll be better after you're gone, and that's exactly how I feel today. We have accelerated growth while simultaneously executing a major transformation. And now nothing will give me more pleasure than to watch our brands and each of our employee and franchise partners go from strength to strength.
When I got the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Yum! starting in 2015, the goal was to lead our culture to fuel results and continue to build brands that people trust and champion while driving aggressive unit expansion. This has always been and remains a foundational pillar for me. We then built on this foundation with the separation of Yum China in October 2016, which was the starting point of our 3-year transformation. We became maniacal about being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to generate more growth and create a world with more Yum!.
We're confident we're well on the way to accomplishing our 2016 transformation goals. We completed our refranchising program and are 98% franchised. We have demonstrated financial discipline by meeting our goal of G&A being 1.7% of system sales and by reducing run rate CapEx. We're on track to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases between 2017 and 2019, and we've generated over 80% total shareholder return since we announced the transformation. 
Additionally, we closed creative and transformative deals to drive profitable system sales growth for Yum! and our franchisees for years to come. We have achieved healthy same-store sales, and our pace of net new unit growth has nearly doubled since we announced our transformation in 2016. 
Our work is not finished, but I'm extremely proud, and I believe the Yum! family is equally proud of what we have accomplished. And we're even more excited about our future growth potential. 
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Chris Turner."

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and our remaining transformation initiatives. 
To begin, the results. Core operating profit grew 6%, and as Greg mentioned, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, with 3% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 8% system sales growth in the quarter. Similarly, Taco Bell had another great quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% for both same-store sales and net new unit growth. 
I'll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses from marking to market our Grubhub investment. 
We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements is now a $0.12 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecasts which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date, 2019 special items are a $0.02 tailwind, and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.14 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account, as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.57. 
Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our 4 growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. 
In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the third quarter. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged. For reference, details of our guidance are available on our website in the Investors section.
Regarding our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $174 million at an average price per share below $115. When combined with dividends, we've already returned $6 billion toward our target $6.5 billion to $7 billion. 
Last but certainly not least, some updates on Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Elevating our customer experience with digital and technology at the forefront is key to growing our brands. To that end, Clay Johnson has joined us as Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer, or CDTO; and Gavin Felder will be promoted to Yum! Chief Strategy Officer effective December 1. These newly created leadership positions will report to me and partner with our brands to accelerate global growth through technology and disruptive innovation. 
Clay has over 20 years of industry experience and comes to us from Walmart where he served as CIO. In his new role as CDTO, Clay will oversee Yum!'s global technology strategy, partnering with our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Divisions. He will lead a coordinated cross-brand effort to accelerate Yum!'s digital commerce strategy, data and analytics and emerging technologies to enhance the customer and employee experience. Additionally, he will provide strategic oversight to our global technology risk management and IT shared services teams. These critical connections will ensure that our technology implementations are developed with the security of our data and infrastructure as a top priority. 
As Chief Strategy Officer, Gavin will be responsible for developing Yum! Brands' long-term corporate strategies and partnering closely with the global brand divisions to implement initiatives to unlock new sources of growth and disruptive innovation. He will work closely with Clay to integrate technology-centric solutions across store operations, including restaurant technology strategies to elevate the customer and team member experience. Gavin is a successful digital leader and proven growth strategist. He started nearly 12 years ago in Yum! Restaurants International as a finance manager before becoming CFO of KFC Africa and later CFO of KFC Global. In his current role, Gavin has overseen strategy, digital and technology, financial planning, supply chain and IT security of our largest global brand. 
With that, I'll hand it off to our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs."
365997,639984583,1846250,"YUM! Brands, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. We'll conclude our call today with an update on our growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. I'll start with our R.E.D",2065,"Thank you, Chris. We'll conclude our call today with an update on our growth drivers: Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. 
I'll start with our R.E.D. brands. KFC delivered its 17th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. This global powerhouse continues to show broad-based strength from standout -- with standout performances across many of our largest markets. This translated into division system sales growth of 8% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 6%. 
International callouts include India, SOPAC, Latin America and our Russia business unit, which includes Central and Eastern Europe. India delivered 7% same-store sales growth driven by distinctive marketing, promotion of the Zinger Burger and consistent value with the Ultimate Savings Bucket. Australia continued to impress with 8% same-store sales growth, their best quarter in recent history. Drivers included the successful Hot Rods promotion and delivery. 
Russia, Central and Eastern Europe posted a strong 7% same-store sales growth owing to a Bucket for 1 value promotion and the finger-lickin' good spin on a taco, Locos Tacos. 
In the U.S., same-store sales declined 1% in the quarter. We had a temporary loss of momentum with the Cheetos sandwich promotion which led to the quarter's decline. However, our value promotion of 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match provided us with a new channel for a la carte menu items, and the quarter brought us many valuable insights to improve future performance. 
We made a splash with plant-based fried chicken alternatives with Beyond nuggets and Beyond boneless wings. The results were very positive. We sold out in 5 hours and generated $2 billion worth of media impressions -- 2 billion media impressions. 
Then at the end of the quarter, we launched Mac & Cheese Bowls, which builds off of flavors you've already seen but packaged in a unique KFC style. We're bullish on the future and are excited about our plans for the rest of 2019 and beyond.
In addition, KFC U.S. continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivery and click-and-collect. We officially launched online ordering at KFC.com on October 13 in conjunction with the introduction of Kentucky Fried Wings and our Rudy-inspired advertising. We now have 2,700 KFCs offering delivery and 3,700 restaurants available for click-and-collect. We're excited about owning our own digital channel and the operation ease this provides our franchisees while Grubhub takes care of the delivery. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut where division system sales grew 7% with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 9%. Pizza Hut International system sales grew 14% in the quarter driven by a 9-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 1%. 
Importantly, we reported positive system sales growth across all international business units during the quarter. In addition, we were encouraged by 3% same-store sales growth in the off-premise segment of our businesses this quarter, lapping similar 3% growth last year or 6% on a 2-year basis. The team's focus on the fundamentals of a modern delivery experience is clearly producing results and a good sign for the future of this business as we migrate more and more to an asset base positioned to win in off-premise. In addition, the system sales growth gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales narrowed from historical levels this quarter to 3 points, reducing the drag on our performance from dine-in. 
In the U.S., system sales declined 2% with same-store sales declining 3% and a 1% net new unit decline. Coming off a solid second quarter, the Pizza Hut U.S. business decelerated in Q3 as changes to our value offerings helped franchisee margins but had a negative impact on transactions. In addition, our previously announced plans to accelerate the transition to a modern delivery asset base in the U.S. while restructuring and upgrading our franchisee base also took a toll on performance.
While we strongly believe that these are the right strategies to build the business for the longer term, these moves will introduce some uncertainty in the business performance over the short term as we expect results to continue to be choppy. We caution we could see a continuation of soft sales and unit contraction throughout 2020 in the Pizza Hut U.S. business. Of course, we know that when we have great franchise operators running first-class assets that are well positioned in trade areas to serve customers, we win in the marketplace, and the Pizza Hut U.S. team is working hard to accelerate this transition.
We continue to expand our Grubhub partnership test with Pizza Hut, which is now active in over 700 restaurants. Pizza Hut is well positioned to leverage being listed on the Grubhub marketplace but by fulfilling delivery orders through our own delivery network. This gives us better control of the customer experience.
Last but not least, Taco Bell, where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 4%. In the U.S., innovation and value continue to be cornerstones of our success. Promotions included Steak Reaper Ranch Fries and the return of the Triple Double Crunchwrap, both of which mixed above 9%. But the Triple Double was the standout of the quarter, available in a $5 box and a la carte. 
Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 6,100 restaurants, and we launched localized AI-driven product recommendations to efficiently give our customers what they want. Kiosk results are encouraging with consistent check lift and utilization. We see particularly strong consumer appeal in urban markets. In fact, in Manhattan, kiosk utilization is over 50% at our Company Cantinas. 
Digital menu boards are offered in over 1,000 locations with a new, simplified menu. Delivery is now live in 4,800 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 14 million registered users. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app.
Internationally, we continue to build a Category of One brand. We had strong sales momentum around the world, driven by focus on iconic core products, value boxes at power price points and product innovation. We saw widespread strength in the Philippines, Japan, Canada and Europe. We continue to strengthen global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. The U.K. ran a Steal a Base, Steal a Taco promotion tied to the Major League Baseball London series, generating strong media buzz and sales momentum.  
Next, on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 389 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last 4 quarters to 1,876, excluding the Telepizza units added in fourth quarter of last year. At KFC, development continued to be strong in Q3 with 317 net new units across 52 countries. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Thailand. In the U.S., we've seen more positive momentum and closed out Q3 with over 1,800 American Showman restaurants across the country.
At Pizza Hut, as we transition the U.S. asset base, we expect the pace of new unit development for the division to decelerate as healthy international unit growth will be offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. All in, the division opened 17 net new units during the quarter. Pizza Hut International opened 76 net new units with noteworthy contributions from Asia, Latin America and Iberia.
Taco Bell delivered 55 net new units during the quarter. In the U.S., we opened 4 new Urban-style Cantina restaurants, hitting the 50-restaurant milestone. Recent Urban Cantina openings include Chicago, San Jose, Champaign and Fort Lauderdale. Internationally, Thailand launched its third store, which is the first outside expat communities in Bangkok. And China and Australia each opened their fifth location. We're continuing to build franchise development capability through events such as a development convention in Guatemala, a 4-day event covering development principles and best practices to foster 3C partners around the world.
Next, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. First, I'd like to highlight the great visit the executive team and myself had with Joey Wat and the Yum China team earlier this month. We were excited to learn about the work they're doing to lead innovation across many aspects of their business. And as always, we were incredibly impressed with their operational execution and overall focus on putting the customer first across all our brands. 
At KFC, we've seen solid improvements across the board, sharing proven ideas and global best practices when it comes to ops-driven sales enablers. This is particularly the case when it comes to speed. Our franchisees in SOPAC created a competitive speed initiative called Fast Friday, which was then adopted by the U.K. to great success. 
At Taco Bell, we're proud to announce this was our fastest Q3 in 5 years, which wouldn't have been possible without the commitment from over -- from our over 7,000 general managers and their teams to deliver unrivaled, fast and friendly service. Our Summer Speed Challenge was a huge driver of this success. We were 17 seconds faster and saw 3 million more cars in our drive-thrus.
At Pizza Hut, we have successfully improved our system average delivery speed, which allows us to deliver hotter pizzas faster to our customers' door. While technology and data science have unlocked key insight, the credit goes to our restaurant leaders and drivers who have implemented these tactics at the store level to provide a Hot, Fast and Reliable experience for our delivery customers.
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Yum!'s 2 biggest assets are our brands and our people. As we build the world's most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands, our culture continues to be a strength and is a key enabler of our continued success. We recently completed our 2019 employee engagement survey of all corporate above-restaurant employees globally, and we scored #1 on employee engagement among an elite benchmark of over 300 global companies. 95% of the corporate employees surveyed are proud to work at Yum! and 91% believe our company is a great place to work. What's even more encouraging is that we have accomplished these results during a time of significant business transformation.
I'd like to finish by saying how excited I am and privileged I am to serve as the next CEO of Yum!. Under Greg's leadership, we have achieved so much already. Of course, there is still more we can achieve in the future. Everywhere we operate, we need to continue elevating and investing in a world-class customer experience with unrivaled talent, modern assets and the best operations with disruptive and innovative technology. This effort will only be realized through a strong partnership with our 2,000 franchisees who run our restaurants and over 1.5 million restaurant team members who bring our brands to life around the world every day. When we are at our best, we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Before we take your questions, I want to personally thank Greg for his tremendous leadership. As we all know, Greg's been making meaningful contributions to Yum! for the past 25 years. He's been fully committed to developing our talent, increasing our collaboration, elevating our brands and growing our business. Yet most importantly, Greg's vision to take Yum!'s unique recognition culture and use it to fuel even better results is what we will all remember. It goes without saying that Greg's big personality and positive energy make him not only a great leader but also one of the best partners and friends I could have had over the last many years. There's no question that working with Greg day in and day out has helped prepare me for this next role and also given me a ton of laughs along the way. It's hard to believe that this will be Greg's last earnings call. 
On behalf of the entire Yum! system, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact that he has made to our business. And we wish Greg and his wife, Carolyn, the very best as they move into this new exciting chapter.
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

The -- can we just talk about -- a little bit about the Pizza Hut business and sort of your outlook? One, you talked about some disruption that may be possible during this period of time. Can you just be specific about that? Is that just sort of lower engagement on franchisees as some would be closing stores? Or what is the nature of that? 
Two, is there an opportunity for the company again to sort of step in either as an intermediary or as -- provide some temporary support from advertising and some way to smooth this process better? Because I think as you look out over 12 months, you want to avoid obviously a disruption. 
And three, I think there was a callout on the profits of the Pizza Hut business U.S., a drag or detraction from past due receivables. How big is that? And is that something we need to be cognizant of as we think about the next year or so? And does it impact the global core operating profit growth?"

As far as your 3 different questions, I'll take the first 2, and we'll let Chris talk a little bit about the receivables.  
As far as the disruption, as you can imagine, when we're closing a lot of stores and opening new stores, that can be an enormous distraction, particularly if we're taking the lead on transitioning franchisees out of the system and their stores into the hands of new players. Some of that will get to the receivables which Chris will talk about. And also while transactions are taking place, obviously, there's a focus issue in terms of where a franchisee's focus is. 
As far as the company stepping in and playing an active role in some of this, I wouldn't rule that out, but that's certainly not the plan now. The great thing about the Pizza Hut U.S. business is we have plenty of people that want to get into it and are eager to buy stores and invest capital into fixing those stores and relocating them. So we see our role as more of a facilitator than we do as somebody to be buying stores, given our asset-light model. But I do think there probably -- there could be an opportunity at different points in time for us to take control of some stores as they transition to another party if that's a better way to approach it. So I wouldn't rule that out. 
And then I'll let Chris just talk a little bit about the receivables."

John, on the receivables side, clearly, being an outstanding franchise operator is one of our top priorities. And our stores do perform the best when we have committed, capable and well-capitalized franchisees. As David just mentioned, we are working to evolve that Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee base, and you did see noted that the past due receivables balances did have an impact. But to kind of put it in context, as we transition certain Pizza Hut franchisees, we will see an uptick in that bad debt. 
But again, to put it in context, year-to-date, we have recorded about $200 million in fee income from our U.S. franchise system. And over 95% of that, we have either collected or anticipate collecting. Obviously, we'll try to minimize the choppiness as we go through this process, but we do believe that the work that we're doing will ultimately be the right thing to strengthen the brand and the overall system."

I think like a lot of companies, we have a healthy dissatisfaction in terms of our tech agenda, and we're going after it much more aggressively, and Chris will -- can talk a little bit about that. 
As far as what we've done to date, obviously, the QuikOrder transaction has worked out quite well. By bringing them in-house, we've been able to improve their capabilities and provide better services to our franchisees at lower cost. The deal with Grubhub has given us great commercial terms for our franchisees. And that's allowed us to uniformly launch delivery without having the pushback that I think others may have seen, both in Taco Bell and the KFC system.

Obviously for competitive reasons, we can't go into a lot of detail on our future strategies. But just to give a little bit of color, I think there are probably 3 ways that we could advance technology.  
One would be evaluating and considering potential acquisitions or investments in technology companies to help leverage our scale, bring those technologies to our stores and our franchisees. Second could be commercial arrangements that we make with technology providers that give our franchisees advantaged economics in taking advantage of those technologies. And then third, given the strength of our team, we'll be developing internally proprietary technologies. 
So those would be the 3 ways that we can leverage scale in this area. The areas that we'll be hunting in range across the full technology spectrum, but e-commerce, data and analytics and any innovations that improve the customer experience and the economics in our stores will clearly be at the forefront."

I think it's important at this point to kind of think about whether KFC can maintain or even accelerate its pace, is the first point. 
Secondly, you've obviously made some fairly cautious total unit count comments around Pizza Hut. Just want to get a little bit more clarification there. 
And then on Taco Bell, I think the comments were, in the press release, 67 gross units in 13 countries. It's hard to drive scale at those kind of numbers internationally, but are we at the point now where Taco Bell can materially accelerate into 2020? And I'd like a follow-up as well."

We've raised our guidance previously to 4% net new unit growth. We still think that's a right longer -- number for the long term. As we've highlighted on the last earnings call, with leaning in on Pizza Hut, that introduced a little bit more uncertainty into the pace of development. But we still think over the next few years we will average that 4% unit growth number. 
As far as Taco Bell, that's actually one of the areas that I think we're most excited about, what's going on in international. We by choice focused on a few countries to try to get the pace of development really going in those countries. So you highlight that it's 13 countries, but when you get a franchisee that signed up to build 600 units in India, obviously that can make a meaningful step-change to the pace of our development at Taco Bell internationally, to just pick 1 example. But we will be expanding to additional countries over time. But I think we're really at the point where Taco Bell International development can start to become a more meaningful contributor to us. 
And then as far as KFC maintaining their lofty pace of development, we see no reason why that can't continue. And the strength of that brand is something that I would just highlight for everybody on this earnings call. It just continues to be widespread strength with clear brand positioning, a team that's really energized about the growth prospects ahead of us and absolutely believe in the -- our ability to continue to grow and develop and accelerate the pace of KFC development."

As far as the Pizza Hut business, I wanted to make sure we all recognize that the Pizza Hut International business is performing quite well, starting to really deliver on some of the things that we've been looking for out of that business in terms of moving to a modern delivery asset base. We talked about in the earnings -- in the script the fact that they're plus 6% on off-premise sales on a 2-year basis, plus 3% lapping a 3%. All of that is a really good sign in terms of the strength of the Pizza Hut brand when it's executed by -- in the market. 
The Pizza Hut U.S. business, as we've talked about also previously, has some unique challenges given the dine-in, the estate and the condition of the assets, the location of those assets. So that's what we're trying to address by moving to a more modern delivery estate and setting the business up for long-term health. Unfortunately, a lot of franchisees or some franchisees have some debt that makes it hard to relocate those assets, and that's what we're working through with those parties, to get the stores in the hands of the right partners that are well capitalized to grow and build the business. 
It's not the majority of our franchisees. The majority of our franchisees are good partners and doing a nice job. But as you know, the QSR category is facing a lot of wage pressures right now, and that is pressuring unit-level economics and franchisees' economics. But as we always remind people, building a new Pizza Hut is a good investment. The unit economics stand on theirselves. This is more about working through with a select group of franchisees that may have more debt on their business than they should, to get those stores capitalized properly and in the right hands of the right partners."

You said that Pizza Hut is well positioned to benefit -- all of your brands, I think, from the Grub partnership. But I guess could you give a little more color on that? And in particular, the extent to which some of -- sometimes, what we've seen is when restaurant companies kind of unlock different ordering channels, there are back of the house challenges and -- just because the production capacities maybe don't quite keep up with how the orders come in. So that was the first part -- question. 
And then the second was just a quick one on KFC and the Beyond nuggets and the extent to which you view this as sort of sustainable versus a short-term very healthy lift, but maybe less of a core part of the menu."

I guess on the question of aggregators, obviously, we value our partnership with Grubhub. And one of the key features of that partnership, to your point, Sara, is that we integrated the technologies so that the orders get passed directly into our POS systems. That wasn't easy. That was part of the reason there was a delay in launch, but we think that does give us a true competitive advantage over a lot of other people that are working with aggregators. So we haven't really had issues that you're alluding to in terms of being able to get the orders to the stores accurately and then back out to the customer. And I think that's why it's working so well.
As far as KFC and Beyond nuggets, obviously, we're all intrigued by plant-based meat alternatives. And the success that we did with Beyond -- the success of that test that we did with Beyond obviously is a good sign. We've done other tests around the world. That's not the only one that we've done. It's the one that's garnered the most press in the U.S. So you can expect more to come on that front. You saw just a couple of weeks ago, Pizza Hut launched -- in the U.S., launched their compostable box and did so with a plant-based alternative meat topping. So we think there's plenty of application for it, but more to come on that over time."

And so we feel comfortable with how we're closing out the transformation from a G&A perspective. It's been reset to a lower base. I think going forward, you could expect a more normal run rate trajectory on G&A. Given the lower base, there will be some timing differences that could create some lumpiness there, and we will be investing in technology and other areas. But we do expect in general to get leverage on our sales growth over time."

Look, I think we're all excited that we're coming out of this transformation with a business that is stronger and better positioned to grow. That's to start. And that is very much due to Greg's leadership over the last 5 years, as I said in my prepared remarks. 
Now that we've got a better machine, we'd like to drive faster and grow faster. And I'll detail a lot of this as we get into 2020, but just to give you a preview. We've talked about this Recipe for Growth and how it's been fueling our growth over the last couple of years. I think there's an opportunity to lean in further within the Recipe for Growth on the customer experience. 
We are not consistently executing the customer experience around the world to the standards that we have. We have pockets of excellence, we can be more consistent on that. There's obviously an opportunity on technology, which Chris talked about. And then there's an opportunity to better leverage our scale. I think now that we are more of a franchisor, less of an equity operator, that gives us the ability to turn our focus to leveraging the scale on behalf of the entire system. We're organized in a better way to do that. I think you're seeing more collaboration around the world, again, thanks to Greg's leadership in dialing up the collaboration. All of that leads to an opportunity on scale. I do think that potentially could be something that would give us a benefit if we did an acquisition. So we don't need an acquisition to grow. Our brands today are strong generally around the world with plenty of growth opportunities, but we certainly wouldn't rule out an acquisition. 
I think the other thing that you'll see us talk about is -- we've talked a lot about the Recipe for Growth. At the same time, we've had what we call our Recipe for Good that our businesses are doing all around the world in their communities, around people, planet and food. We'll talk more about that as we get into 2020 and the way we can dial up our communication on that and our efforts in that area."

Certainly, some challenges in Pizza Hut U.S. would pressure that model, but at the same time, upside from Taco Bell International growth and all of the other success that we're having around the world with KFC gives you confidence that we can overcome pressures to the model. Again, we'll talk more about that in Q4 when we get sort of our updates to the long-term growth model. 
Our plan is really to just provide you on an annual basis any onetime adjustments to the long-term growth model. For example this year, we had a 53rd week. Next year, we'll be lapping the 53rd week. We'll provide you the guidance for what that means for 2019 -- for 2020.
