We experienced good growth in all of our service lines for the quarter, with residential up 7.8%, Commercial Pest Control rose 5.9% and termite and ancillary rose 8.2%. 2018 was a good year for Rollins, as we continue to build our global presence through acquisitions both domestically and overseas. 
In the U.K., we expanded our footprint with the acquisition of 3 prime companies: Guardian Pest Control, Ames group and Kestrel pest control. We also achieved an important milestone for the company when we acquired Aardwolf Pestkare. This is Rollins first company owned operation in Singapore.
In the U.S., we acquired OPC pest control, a premier pest control company in Kentucky, and we also made a small tuck-in acquisitions. And the year-end we had added a total of 38 companies to our roster. We also continue to expand the Orkin brand internationally with the addition of franchises of South America, Europe and Middle East, Latin America and other locations. The Orkin brand is now represented in 57 countries throughout 86 international franchises.
As we enter 2019, strategic acquisition will remain a focus of our growth strategy. We're extremely pleased to have announced earlier this month our agreement to Clark Pest Control. Headquartered in Lodi California, Clark Pest operations in over 20 locations in California and Nevada. Founded by Charlie Clark in 1950, the company is going to be the eighth largest pest control provider in the U.S. Clark recorded revenues of $130 million in 2017. The company is also growing at a faster rate than we are as well as a faster rate than the overall pest control industry.
First adjusted with the company over 20 years ago when I was fortunate enough to meet Charlie Clark, an icon in our industry. We have admired the company throughout all this time. The Clark acquisition will be the largest in our company's history. John will provide more details in this acquisition. But I wanted to express our enthusiasm in acquiring this prime company and personally welcome their team to the Rollins family.
I'd now like to turn the call over to John."

As Gary noted, we are very pleased to have Clark Pest Control join our family. The Clark team is a natural fit for Rollins, sharing the same values that we did get more on that later.
They service customers through more than 20 branch location in Noth and Southern California and Nevada. Clark Pest Control is stronger in the upper central Valley in northern California areas than Orkin and our other brands. It was very interesting to learn during our due diligence process, how closely linked Clark and our business brands Orkin are in their history. As you may know, Orkin was founded by auto Orkin in 1901, but didn't expand to the West Coast prior to the Mormons purchased in 1964. Meanwhile, Charlie Clark found Clark Pest Control in California in 1950 and Patton got some of the foundational principles of quality customer service, delivered by well-trained people just as Auto Orkin did. Both companies have certainly retained those principles of quality service delivered by well-trained team members today. Clark has long been recognized as a premier pest control company in residential, commercial and termite services in the markets it serves. Their strong culture of customer service has been aided by very high employee retention rates and has resulted in a loyal and expanding customer base.
We are aware that owners have a choice when they look to sell their business, and there are 4 very important factors that come into play. What is best for their family, their employees and their customers as well as receiving value for the company. We take each of those into account and customize our acquisition plan to fit those factors. What was apparent in our discussions with Clark from the beginning is how deeply they care about what would happen to their employees and customers are following the sale.
They, like us to recognize how important that people are to their success and also, like us, are dedicated to continually improving both the employee and the customer experience. 
Over time, we have distinguished ourselves with our acquisitions where our key management and employees remain on after work. And it is 1 reason why Rollins has gained a reputation of being the industry's acquirer of choice.
Sellers know that they can trust us to live up our words once we closed on our pressures. We even invite potential targets to reach out to the brands we have acquired as well as ones we have lost out on to see if they're happy or not. In addition to Clark Pest Control, expanding our presence in California and Nevada, we believe, the company provide significant opportunities for Rollins and Clark to learn from each other, which we had repeatedly expressed as one of our primary objectives with our acquisitions.
Potential opportunities we have encountered previously include: materials and supplies purchasing, better vehicle leasing arrangements, training, employee benefits and lower technology and communication expenses to name a few. Rollins will fund the acquisition using the combination of cash and debt. Eddie, will go into further financial details related to this acquisition in a few minutes. Clark Pest Control under the leadership of long-term Clark team member Robert Baker all joined our specialty brands group will lead by Jerry Gahlhoff. Brands in this group include HomeTeam, Western, Waltham, Northwest Exterminating and OPC services.
Jerry and I've had the privilege of visiting every Clark operation to meet with their employees and appropriately welcome them to Rollins. We wanted them to know that they are valued and how much we look forward to working with them to further advance their great brand.
I will now turn the call back over to Eddie."

Before I get into our quarterly and year-end numbers, I want to reiterate the positive impact of our enhanced-employee benefits. Of our people are so pleased with the investments that we made in 2018. And looking back, this was absolutely the right decision and have been reinforced by the positive results that they have produced for the year. As you may recall, in April, we increased our 401(k) match and provided stock [ grants ] 12 employees which added about $10 million to our expense for the year. But this recognition of their impact on our business is rippling through our results.
Of a recent leadership meeting in Atlanta was the first that we have had -- first that we've held since rolling this announcement out last April. The comments of many of the over 100 participants were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative.
I want to share a few of the positive changes that we have seen. All employees want to work for an employer of choice. Our employee retention rate had the best year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter in 2018 since 2016. As you know, during that same time period, the unemployment rate has fallen from 4.7% down to 3.9% in December of 2018.
Investing in our people is one of the components that has helped us in this area. We've also often talked about how important our technicians are in their relationship with our customers. Our improved employee retention has translated directly to higher customer attention in Q4 and for all of 2018. Our organic growth rate, again to historic highs as a result of a better technician and customer retention.
Enhancing our employee benefits will continue to drive improvements in employee and customer retention for years to come.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and keys to the quarter included a record organic growth rates, piloting testing of the BOSS rollout in Canada. And as I just mentioned, improvements in our employee retention rate high to our enhanced employee benefits.
Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $444.6 million with an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenues of $414.7 million. Income before income taxes increased 4.3% to $71.5 million from $68.5 million in 2017. Expense and depreciation increased during the quarter as we continue to rollout and began testing BOSS in Canada. Net income rose 51.1% to $51 million and EPS increased 60% to $0.16 per diluted share compared to $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $87.8 million, up 5.1% over Q4 of 2017. As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we continue to make sizable acquisitions that will impact our depreciation and amortization.
For the 12 months that ended December 31, we produced record revenues of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, which was an increase of 8.8% over the same time period last year. Income before income taxes increased 5.5% to $310.7 million and net income rose 29.3% to $231.7 million compared to 2017. EPS increased 29.1% to $0.71 per share compared to $0.55 per share in 2017. EBITDA was $377.3 million in 2018 compared to $350.8 million in 2017, up 7.5%.
Our financial health enables us to do the -- I'm sorry, enables us to continue to be nimble and improve our business. Companies that did not anticipate change and take advantage of market opportunities and seek ways to make it easier for your customers to do business with you do not drive, and in some cases, do not survive. The past 50 years have shown that Rollins has successfully managed for the long-term and the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control is a great example of that.
John Jason, good color on the Clark impending purchase. Based on his time working on this acquisition and spending a lot of time visiting their employees. But lets shift our attention to what we know about the financial impact of the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We anticipate closing sometime in Q1 of 2019, subject to obtaining regulatory clearance.
For all of you that have passed what we be willing to leverage our balance sheet, this is your deal. While we plan to use cash for a portion of the purchase, we will be taking on debt in the form of a term loan tied to LIBOR to supplement the rest. This deal makes taking on debt worthwhile for us and again, is investing in our future for decades to come.
The company is very profitable, but with the goodwill amortization, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1 but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once we close on the deal, we will share more related to the anticipated impact of this acquisition on our total Rollins results moving forward.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increased 7.2% and included 1.6% from several acquisitions and the remaining 5.6% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 7.8%. Commercial pest control, which made up 39% of our revenue, was up 5.9%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 8.2%.
Both residential and termite, benefited from our OPC acquisition. Again, total revenue West acquisition was up 5.6% and from that, residential was up 6.8%. Commercial increased 3.2% and termite improved by a 7.5%.
Back to my earlier point on employing customer retention for the full year, total organic revenue grew 5.3% and is the fastest organic growth rate in over 5 years. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of the foreign companies and currency, total, we grew 7.1%.; residential grew 8%.; commercial pest control was up 5%; and termite improved 8.5%.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 50.2%, up slightly from 50% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency and route against scheduling even as we have lapped effort that began 18 months ago. Average miles driven per vehicle in our Orkin fleet were down an additional 2.6% year-over-year. Fleet expenses increased to $3 million or 13.6% for the quarter, driven by moderated but still higher price per gallon cost and increased leased vehicle expense. Personnel related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and the onetime employee's stock brands.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.7 million to $16.6 million, an increase of 11.3%. Depreciation increased $790,000 due to acquisitions, equipment purchases and continued BOSS rollout. While amortization of intangible assets increased $900,000 due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions.
Sales, general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter increased $12.1 million or 9.8% to $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues, up [ 0.7 ] of a percentage point from $123.7 million or 29.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter 2017. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily driven due to higher sale salaries [ up ] $3.1 million due to higher sales commission, which is tied to a record organic growth rates.
$3 million additional expense in administrative salaries attributable to amortization of restricted stock brands and expense associated with acquisitions. Personnel-related increase of $1.9 million from the enhanced 401(k) benefits. In Q4, we saw an increase in the 401(k) match as more employees benefited from these enhancements.
The full year SG&A number increased 9.4% and came in at 30.2% of revenue compared to 30.1% of revenue in 2017. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2018, we spent $76.7 million on acquisitions compared to $130.2 million, the same period last year, which included Northwest Exterminating. As we continued to find good quality pest control companies  and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We paid $152.7 million in dividends, which included a special dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which was an increase of 25.2%. We have $27.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 9.7% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition.
We ended the period with $115.5 million in cash of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiary. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on March 11, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business February the 11th, 2019.
The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.

Good quality companies are coming to the table, which of course, we want to be a part of. We continue to expand our look into different geographies to find the right fit. As you know, Singapore this year in 2016, the U.K. we entered and we added some into U.K. this year. But I think a lot of it also have to do with actual industry itself. It's an industry started after World War II. Some of the original owners are having to make life decisions on what they want to do with their company. And John talked a little bit about on how different companies make those different decisions. So I would say, we're still, probably 2 to 3 -- the next year, I would say was still in that type of cycle. Happen to do with different companies making different decisions on what they want to do. Whether it is to hand it off and keep it within their family or whether it is do something different that will pass it along. But I think there's going to continue to be opportunity. Whether it's pending acquisition for us, it will be the largest part of our history. So it's hard to sit here and say today, how active we will be. But when the right opportunity presents itself, we still actually going to be at the table. But we're going to have a lot of good work to do, having to do with this depending what we have."

There won't be any where near the significance of the impact of a year-over-year perspective. The sales, our commission fees, we just don't know what's going on with that. As long as we continue to find ways to be able to grow, and we continue to hit these new highs as far as about the organic growth rates are concerned and our sales folks are executing. We may continue to see dollars that are in that area. On the fleet side, we're all seeing the price of fuel that continues to kind of stabilize now and when we started lapping year-over-year. There should be less headwind our may be, possibly a benefit with that. So I would say that are lot of guidance that we have our onetime items on the expense side from the employee benefits.

I think when take a look at the items that drove the quarter-over-quarter disappointment that might be out there based on what you say happen to do with stock price. And we go through and we kind of pas through that. We look at our investment in our employees, the 401(k) benefits. We look at IT spend, rolling out enhancements in Canada where we've already seen improvements in the U.S. when we did that. Our largest acquisition in the cost related to that, largest acquisition that's been pending in our company's history and the cost related to that.

It takes a lot of stress out of others when we have a very clear day for them to be able to go through manage, and we start taking away issues and problems that the customers my have through better communication, things like that.

We're pleased to report our 51st consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings.

Net income increased 51.1% to $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $33.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the same quarter of 2017.
Revenues for the full year rose 8.8% to $1.822 billion compared to $1.674 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 29.3% to approximately $231.7 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.71 compared to net income of $179.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share for the full year 2017.
We experienced good growth in all of our service lines for the quarter, with residential up 7.8%, commercial pest control rose 5.9%, and termite and ancillary rose 8.2%. 2018 was a good year for Rollins as we continued to build our global presence through acquisitions, both domestically and overseas.
In the U.K., we expanded our footprint with the acquisition of 3 prime companies: Guardian Pest Control, AMES Group and Kestrel Pest Control. We also achieved an important milestone for the company when we acquired Aardwolf Pestkare. This is Rollins first company-owned operation in Singapore.
In the U.S., we acquired OPC Pest Control, a premier pest control company in Kentucky, and we also made small tuck-in acquisitions. At year-end, we had added a total of 38 companies to our roster. We also continued to expand the Orkin brand internationally with the addition of franchises in South America, Europe and Middle East, Latin America and other locations. The Orkin brand is now represented in 57 countries through our 86 international franchises.
As we enter 2019, strategic acquisitions will remain a focus of our growth strategy. We're extremely pleased to have announced earlier this month our agreement to acquire Clark Pest Control. Headquartered in Lodi California, Clark has operations in over 20 locations in California and Nevada. Founded by Charlie Clark in 1950, the company is growing to be the eighth largest pest control provider in the U.S. Clark recorded revenues of $130 million in 2017. The company is also growing at a faster rate than we are as well as a faster rate than the overall pest control industry.
I first visited with the company over 20 years ago and I was fortunate enough to meet Charlie Clark, an icon in our industry. We have admired the company throughout all of this time. The Clark acquisition will be the largest in our company's history. John will provide more details on this acquisition, but I wanted to express our enthusiasm in acquiring this prime company and personally welcome their team to the Rollins' family.
I'd now like to turn the call over to John."

As Gary noted, we are very pleased to have Clark Pest Control join our family. The Clark team is a natural fit for Rollins, sharing the same values that we did, more on that later.
They service customers through more than 20 branch location in North and Southern California and Nevada. Clark Pest Control is stronger in the upper central valley in Northern California areas than Orkin and our other brands. It was very interesting to learn during our due diligence process how closely linked Clark and our biggest brand, Orkin, are in their history. As you may know, Orkin was founded by Otto Orkin in 1901, but didn't expand to the West Coast prior to the Rollins' purchase in 1964. Meanwhile, Charlie Clark found Clark Pest Control in California in 1950 and patterned Clark on some of the foundational principles of quality customer service, delivered by well-trained people just as Otto Orkin did. Both companies have certainly retained those principles of quality service, delivered by well-trained team members today. Clark has long been recognized as a premier pest control company in residential, commercial and termite services in the markets it serves. Their strong culture of customer service has been aided by very high employee retention rates and has resulted in a loyal and expanding customer base.
We are aware that owners have a choice when they look to sell their business, and there are 4 very important factors that come into play. What is best for their family, their employees and their customers as well as receiving value for the company? We take each of those into account and customize our acquisition plan to fit those factors. What was apparent in our discussions with Clark from the beginning is how deeply they care about what would happen to their employees and customers following the sale. They, like us, recognize how important their people are to their success and also, like us, are dedicated to continually improving both the employee and the customer experience.
Over time, we have distinguished ourselves with our acquisitions where key management and employees remain on after work. And it is one reason why Rollins has gained a reputation of being the industry's acquirer of choice. Sellers know they can trust us to live up to our word once we have closed on a purchase. We even invite potential targets to reach out to the brands we have acquired as well as the ones we have lost out on to see if they're happy or not.
In addition to Clark Pest Control, expanding our presence in California and Nevada, we believe the company provided significant opportunities for Rollins and Clark to learn from each other, which we had repeatedly expressed as one of our primary objectives with our acquisitions.
Potential opportunities we have encountered previously include materials and supplies purchasing, better vehicle-leasing arrangements, training, employee benefits, and lower technology and communication expenses to name a few. Rollins will fund the acquisition, using a combination of cash and debt. Eddie will go into further financial details related to this acquisition in a few minutes. Clark Pest Control, under the leadership of long-term Clark team member Robert Baker, who will join our Specialty Brands group, will be led by Jerry Gahlhoff. Brands in this group include HomeTeam, Western, Waltham, Northwest Exterminating and OPC Services.
Jerry and I've had the privilege of visiting every Clark operation to meet with their employees and personally welcome them to Rollins. We wanted them to know that they are valued and how much we look forward to working with them to further advance their great brand.
I will now turn the call back over to Eddie."

And looking back, this was absolutely th",1450,"Thank you, John. Before I get into our quarterly and year-end numbers, I want to reiterate the positive impact of our enhanced employee benefits. Our people are so pleased with the investments that we made in 2018. And looking back, this was absolutely the right decision and have been reinforced by the positive results that they have produced for the year. As you may recall, in April, we increased our 401(k) match and provided stock grants to our employees, which added about $10 million to our expense for the year. But this recognition of their impact on our business is rippling through our results.
Our recent leadership meeting in Atlanta was the first that we have had -- first that we've held since rolling this announcement out last April. The comments of many of the over 100 participants were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative.
I want to share a few of the positive changes that we have seen. All employees want to work for an employer of choice. Our employee retention rate had the best year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter in 2018 since 2016. As you know, during that same time period, the unemployment rate has fallen from 4.7% down to 3.9% in December of 2018.
Investing in our people is one of the components that has helped us in this area. We've also often talked about how important our technicians are in their relationship with our customers. Our improved employee retention has translated directly to higher customer retention in Q4 and for all of 2018. Our organic growth rates, again, ticked to historic highs as a result of better technician and customer retention. Enhancing our employee benefits will continue to drive improvements in employee and customer retention for years to come.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and keys to the quarter included record organic growth rates, piloting testing of the BOSS rollout in Canada, and as I just mentioned, improvements in our employee retention rate tied to our enhanced employee benefits.
Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $444.6 million was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 million. Income before income taxes increased 4.3% to $71.5 million from $68.5 million in 2017. Expense and depreciation increased during the quarter as we continued to roll out and began testing BOSS in Canada. Net income rose 51.1% to $51 million, and EPS increased 60% to $0.16 per diluted share compared to $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $87.8 million, up 5.1% over Q4 of 2017. As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we continue to make sizable acquisitions that will impact our depreciation and amortization.
For the 12 months that ended December 31, we produced record revenues of $1.822 billion, which was an increase of 8.8% over the same time period last year. Income before income taxes increased 5.5% to $310.7 million, and net income rose 29.3% to $231.7 million compared to 2017. EPS increased 29.1% to $0.71 per share compared to $0.55 per share in 2017. EBITDA was $377.3 million in 2018 compared to $350.8 million in 2017, up 7.5%.
Our financial health enables us to be -- I'm sorry, enables us to continue to be nimble and improve our business. Companies that did not anticipate change and take advantage of market opportunities and seek ways to make it easier for your customers to do business with you do not drive, and in some cases, do not survive. The past 50 years have shown that Rollins has successfully managed for the long-term, and the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control is a great example of that.
John gave some good color on the Clark's impending purchase. Based on his time, working on this acquisition and spending a lot of time visiting their employees. But let's shift our attention to what we know about the financial impact of the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We anticipate closing sometime in Q1 of 2019, subject to obtaining regulatory clearance.
For all of you that have asked what we'd be willing to leverage our balance sheet, this is your deal. While we plan to use cash for a portion of the purchase, we will be taking on debt in the form of a term loan tied to LIBOR to supplement the rest. This deal makes taking on debt worthwhile for us, and again, is investing in our future for decades to come.
The company is very profitable, but with the goodwill amortization, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1 but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once we close on the deal, we will share more related to the anticipated impact of this acquisition on our total Rollins results moving forward.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increased 7.2% and included 1.6% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.6% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 7.8%. Commercial pest control, which made up 39% of our revenue, was up 5.9%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 8.2%.  Both residential and termite benefited from our OPC acquisition. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.6%, and from that, residential was up 6.8%, commercial increased 3.2%, and termite improved by 7.5%.
Back to my earlier point on employee and customer retention for the full year, total organic revenue grew 5.3% and is the fastest organic growth rate in over 5 years. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total, we grew 7.1%, residential grew 8%, commercial pest control was up 5%, and termite improved 8.5%.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 50.2%, up slightly from 50% for prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency and routing and scheduling, even as we have last efforts that began 18 months ago. Average miles driven per vehicle in our Orkin fleet were down an additional 2.6% year-over-year. Fleet expenses increased $3 million or 13.6% for the quarter, driven by moderated but still higher price per gallon costs and increased leased vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and onetime employee stock grants.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.7 million to $16.6 million, an increase of 11.3%. Depreciation increased $790,000 due to acquisitions, equipment purchases and continued BOSS rollout. While amortization of intangible assets increased $900,000 due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions.
Sales, general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter increased $12.1 million or 9.8% to $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues, up 0.7% from $123.7 million or 29.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter 2017. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily driven to higher sales salaries of $3.1 million due to higher sales commissions, which is tied to a record organic growth rate; $3 million additional expense in administrative salaries, attributable to amortization of restricted stock grants and expense associated with acquisitions; personnel-related increase of $1.9 million from the enhanced 401(k) benefits. In Q4, we saw an increase in the 401(k) match as more employees benefited from these enhancements.
The full year SG&A number increased 9.4% and came in at 30.2% of revenue compared to 30.1% of revenue in 2017. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2018, we spent $76.7 million on acquisitions compared to $130.2 million the same period last year, which included Northwest Exterminating, and as we continue to find good quality pest control companies and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We paid $152.7 million on dividends, which included a special dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which was an increase of 25.2%. We have $27.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 9.7% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition.
We ended the period with $115.5 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on March 11, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 11, 2019. The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.

I think a little bit of that is going to be attributable to our team here, just continue to develop the relationships and being ready to go when companies are ready to go. Good quality companies are coming to the table, which, of course, we want to be a part of. We continue to expand our look into different geographies to find the right fit. As you know, Singapore this year, in 2016, the U.K. we entered, then we added some more into the U.K. this year. But I think a lot of it also has to do with the actual industry itself. It's an industry that started after World War II. Some of the original owners are having to make life decisions on what they want to do with their company. And John talked a little bit about that on how different companies make those different decisions. So I would say, we're still probably 2 to 3 -- in the next few years, I would say, we'd still be in that type of a cycle, having to do with different companies, making different decisions on what they want to do. Whether it is to hand it off and keep it within their family or whether it is to do something different that they'll be able to pass it along. But I think there's going to continue to be opportunity. Whether it's a pending acquisition for us, it'll be our largest in our history. So it's hard to sit here and say, today, how active we will be. But when the right opportunity presents itself, we're still absolutely going to be at the table. But we're going to have a lot of good work to do, having to do with this, depending on what we have."

We did have -- to your point, we did have a little bit of an uptick in Q4. More folks are continuing to be able to take advantage of that. But if you take a look at the total, total numbers, they won't be anywhere near the significance of the impact from a year-over-year perspective. The sales, our commission fees, we just don't know what's going on with that. As long as we continue to find ways to be able to grow, and we continue to hit these new highs as far as our organic growth rates are concerned and our sales folks are executing, we may continue to see dollars that are in that area. On the fleet side, we're all seeing the price of fuel that continues to kind of stabilize now and when we start lapping a year-over-year, there should be less of a headwind or may be even possibly a benefit with that. So I would say that a lot of the items that we have are onetime items on the expense side from the employee benefits. But then we also have other things that, I think, intuitively we will all see that are kind of moving in the right direction.

Our largest acquisition and the costs that related to that largest acquisition that's impending in our company's history and the costs that related to that.

It takes a lot of the stress out of it when we have a very clear day for them to be able to go through and manage, and we start taking away issues and problems that the customers might have through better communication and things like that.

We're pleased to report our 51st consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. Revenues for the quarter grew 7.2% to $444.6 million compared to $414.7 million for the fourth quarter last year. Net income increased 51.1% to $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $33.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the same quarter of 2017.
Revenues for the full year rose 8.8% to $1.822 billion compared to $1.674 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 29.3% to approximately $231.7 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.71 compared to net income of $179.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share for the full year 2017.
We experienced good growth in all of our service lines for the quarter, with residential up 7.8%, commercial pest control rose 5.9%, and termite and ancillary rose 8.2%. 2018 was a good year for Rollins as we continued to build our global presence through acquisitions, both domestically and overseas.
In the U.K., we expanded our footprint with the acquisition of 3 prime companies: Guardian Pest Control, AMES Group and Kestrel Pest Control. We also achieved an important milestone for the company when we acquired Aardwolf Pestkare. This is Rollins' first company-owned operation in Singapore.
In the U.S., we acquired OPC Pest Control, a premier pest control company in Kentucky, and we also made small tuck-in acquisitions. And at year-end, we had added a total of 38 companies to our roster. We also continued to expand the Orkin brand internationally with the addition of franchises in South America, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and other locations. The Orkin brand is now represented in 57 countries throughout 86 international franchises.
As we enter 2019, strategic acquisitions will remain a focus of our growth strategy. We're extremely pleased to have announced earlier this month our agreement to acquire Clark Pest Control. Headquartered in Lodi, California, Clark has operations in over 20 locations in California and Nevada. Founded by Charlie Clark in 1950, the company has grown to be the eighth largest pest control provider in the U.S. Clark recorded revenues of $130 million in 2017. The company is also growing at a faster rate than we are as well as a faster rate than the overall pest control industry.
I first visited with the company over 20 years ago and I was fortunate enough to meet Charlie Clark, an icon in our industry. We have admired the company throughout all of this time. The Clark acquisition will be the largest in our company's history. John will provide more details on this acquisition, but I wanted to express our enthusiasm in acquiring this fine company and personally welcome their team to the Rollins' family.
I'd now like to turn the call over to John."

As Gary noted, we are very pleased to have Clark Pest Control join our family. The Clark team is a natural fit for Rollins, sharing the same values that we do, more on that later.
They service customers through more than 20 branch location in North and Southern California and Nevada. Clark Pest Control is stronger in the upper central valley in Northern California areas than Orkin and our other brands. It was very interesting to learn during our due diligence process how closely linked Clark and our biggest brand, Orkin, are in their history. As you may know, Orkin was founded by Otto Orkin in 1901 but didn't expand to the West Coast prior to the Rollins' purchase in 1964. Meanwhile, Charlie Clark founded Clark Pest Control in California in 1950 and patterned Clark on some of the foundational principles of quality customer service delivered by well-trained people just as Otto Orkin did. Both companies have certainly retained those principles of quality service, delivered by well-trained team members today. Clark has long been recognized as a premier pest control company in residential, commercial and termite services in the markets it serves. Their strong culture of customer service has been aided by very high employee retention rates and has resulted in a loyal and expanding customer base.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We are aware that owners have a choice when they look to sell their business, and there are 4 very important factors that come into play. What is best for their family, their employees and their customers as well as receiving value for the company? We take each of those into account and customize our acquisition plan to fit those factors. What was apparent in our discussions with Clark from the beginning is how deeply they care about what would happen to their employees and customers following the sale. They, like us, recognize how important their people are to their success and also, like us, are dedicated to continually improving both the employee and the customer experience.
Over time, we have distinguished ourselves with our acquisitions where key management and employees remain on afterward. And it is one reason why Rollins has gained a reputation of being the industry's acquirer of choice. Sellers know they can trust us to live up to our word once we have closed on a purchase. We even invite potential targets to reach out to the brands we have acquired as well as the ones we have lost out on to see if they're happy or not.
In addition to Clark Pest Control, expanding our presence in California and Nevada, we believe the company provides significant opportunities for Rollins and Clark to learn from each other, which we have repeatedly expressed as one of our primary objectives with our acquisitions.
Potential opportunities we have encountered previously include materials and supplies purchasing, better vehicle-leasing arrangements, training, employee benefits, and lower technology and communication expenses to name a few. Rollins will fund the acquisition using a combination of cash and debt. Eddie will go into further financial details related to this acquisition in a few minutes. Clark Pest Control, under the leadership of long-term Clark team member Robert Baker, will join our Specialty Brands group led by Jerry Gahlhoff. Brands in this group include HomeTeam, Western, Waltham, Northwest Exterminating and OPC Services.
Jerry and I have had the privilege of visiting every Clark operation to meet with their employees and personally welcome them to Rollins. We wanted them to know that they are valued and how much we look forward to working with them to further advance their great brand.
I will now turn the call back over to Eddie."

And looking back, this was absolutely",1449,"Thank you, John. Before I get into our quarterly and year-end numbers, I wanted to reiterate the positive impact of our enhanced employee benefits. Our people are so pleased with the investments that we made in 2018. And looking back, this was absolutely the right decision and have been reinforced by the positive results that they have produced for the year. As you may recall, in April, we increased our 401(k) match and provided stock grants to our employees, which added about $10 million to our expense for the year. But this recognition of their impact on our business is rippling through our results.
Our recent leadership meeting in Atlanta was the first that we have had -- first that we've held since rolling this announcement out last April. The comments of many of the over 100 participants were overwhelmingly positive and appreciated. 
I want to share a few of the positive changes that we have seen. All employees want to work for an employer of choice. Our employee retention rate had the best year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter in 2018 since 2016. As you know, during that same time period, the unemployment rate has fallen from 4.7% down to 3.9% in December of 2018.
Investing in our people is one of the components that has helped us in this area. We've also often talked about how important our technicians are in their relationship with our customers. Our improved employee retention has translated directly to higher customer retention in Q4 and for all of 2018. Our organic growth rates, again, ticked to historic highs as a result of better technician and customer retention. Enhancing our employee benefits will continue to drive improvements in employee and customer retention for years to come.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and keys to the quarter included record organic growth rates, piloting testing of the BOSS rollout in Canada, and as I just mentioned, improvements in our employee retention rate tied to our enhanced employee benefits.
Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $444.6 million was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 million. Income before income taxes increased 4.3% to $71.5 million from $68.5 million in 2017. Expense and depreciation increased during the quarter as we continued to roll out and began testing BOSS in Canada. Net income rose 51.1% to $51 million, and EPS increased 60% to $0.16 per diluted share compared to $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $87.8 million, up 5.1% over Q4 of 2017. As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we continue to make sizable acquisitions that will impact our depreciation and amortization.
For the 12 months that ended December 31, we produced record revenues of $1.822 billion, which was an increase of 8.8% over the same time period last year. Income before income taxes increased 5.5% to $310.7 million, and net income rose 29.3% to $231.7 million compared to 2017. EPS increased 29.1% to $0.71 per share compared to $0.55 per share in 2017. EBITDA was $377.3 million in 2018 compared to $350.8 million in 2017, up 7.5%.
Our financial health enables us to be -- I'm sorry, enables us to continue to be nimble and improve our business. Companies that did not anticipate change and take advantage of market opportunities and seek ways to make it easier for your customers to do business with you do not drive, and in some cases, do not survive. The past 50 years have shown that Rollins has successfully managed for the long-term, and the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control is a great example of that.
John gave some good color on the Clark's impending purchase based on his time working on this acquisition and spending a lot of time visiting their employees. But let's shift our attention to what we know about the financial impact of the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We anticipate closing sometime in Q1 of 2019, subject to obtaining regulatory clearance.
For all of you that have asked would we be willing to leverage our balance sheet, this is your deal. While we plan to use cash for a portion of the purchase, we will be taking on debt in the form of a term loan tied to LIBOR to supplement the rest. This deal makes taking on debt worthwhile for us, and again, is investing in our future for decades to come.
The company is very profitable, but with the goodwill amortization, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1 but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once we close on the deal, we will share more related to the anticipated impact of this acquisition on our total Rollins results moving forward.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increased 7.2% and included 1.6% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.6% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 7.8%. Commercial pest control, which made up 39% of our revenue, was up 5.9%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 8.2%.  Both residential and termite benefit from our OPC acquisition. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.6%, and from that, residential was up 6.8%, commercial increased 3.2%, and termite improved by 7.5%.
Back to my earlier point on employee and customer retention, for the full year, total organic revenue grew 5.3% and is the fastest organic growth rate in over 5 years. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total, we grew 7.1%, residential grew 8%, commercial pest control was up 5%, and termite improved 8.5%.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 50.2%, up slightly from 50% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency and routing and scheduling, even as we have last efforts that began 18 months ago. Average miles driven per vehicle in our Orkin fleet were down an additional 2.6% year-over-year. Fleet expenses increased $3 million or 13.6% for the quarter, driven by moderated but still higher price per gallon costs and increased leased vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and onetime employee stock grants.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.7 million to $16.6 million, an increase of 11.3%. Depreciation increased $790,000 due to acquisitions, equipment purchases and continued BOSS rollout. While amortization of intangible assets increased $900,000 due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions.
Sales, general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter increased $12.1 million or 9.8% to $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues, up 0.7% from $123.7 million or 29.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter 2017. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily driven to higher sales salaries of $3.1 million due to higher sales commissions, which is tied to our record organic growth rate; $3 million additional expense in administrative salaries, attributable to amortization of restricted stock grants and expense associated with acquisitions; personnel-related increase of $1.9 million from the enhanced 401(k) benefits. In Q4, we saw an increase in the 401(k) match as more employees benefited from these enhancements.
The full year SG&A number increased 9.4% and came in at 30.2% of revenue compared to 30.1% of revenue in 2017. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2018, we spent $76.7 million on acquisitions compared to $130.2 million the same period last year, which included Northwest Exterminating, and as we continued to find good quality pest control companies and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We paid $152.7 million on dividends, which included a special dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which was an increase of 25.2%. We have $27.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 9.7% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition.
We ended the period with $115.5 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on March 11, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 11, 2019. The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

I think a little bit of that is going to be attributable to our team here, just continue to develop the relationships and being ready to go when companies are ready to go. Good quality companies are coming to the table, which, of course, we want to be a part of. We continue to expand our look into different geographies to find the right fit. As you know, Singapore this year, in 2016, the U.K. we entered, and we added some more into the U.K. this year. But I think a lot of it also has to do with the actual industry itself. It's an industry that started after World War II. Some of the original owners are having to make life decisions on what they want to do with their company. And John talked a little bit about that on how different companies make those different decisions. So I would say, we're still probably 2 to 3 -- in the next few years, I would say, we'd still be in that type of a cycle, having to deal with different companies making different decisions on what they want to do. Whether it is to hand it off and keep it within their family or whether it is to do something different and be able to pass it along. But I think there's going to continue to be opportunity. With this pending acquisition for us, it'll be our largest in our history. So it's hard to sit here and say today how active we will be. But when the right opportunity presents itself, we're still absolutely going to be at the table. But we're going to have a lot of good work to do, having to do with this, depending on what we have."

But if you take a look at the total, total numbers, there won't be anywhere near the significance of the impact from a year-over-year perspective. The sales, our commission piece, we just don't know what's going on with that. As long as we continue to find ways to be able to grow, and we continue to hit these new highs as far as our organic growth rates are concerned and our sales folks are executing, we may continue to see dollars that are in that area. On the fleet side, we're all seeing the price of fuel that continues to kind of stabilize now and when we start lapping a year-over-year, there should be less of a headwind or maybe even possibly a benefit with that. So I would say that a lot of the items that we have are onetime items on the expense side from the employee benefits. But then we also have other things that, I think, intuitively we will all see that are kind of moving in the right direction.

I think when take a look at the items that drove the ""disappointment"" that might be out there, based on what you said, having to do with the stock price. And we go through and we kind of parse through that. We look at an investment in our employees, the 401(k) benefits, we look at IT spend, rolling out enhancements in Canada where we've already seen improvements in the U.S. when we did that. Our largest acquisition and the costs that are related to that largest acquisition that's impending in our company's history and the costs that are related to that.

We're pleased to report our 51st consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. Revenues for the quarter grew 7.2% to $444.6 million compared to $414.7 million for the fourth quarter last year. Net income increased 51.1% to $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $33.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the same quarter of 2017.
Revenues for the full year rose 8.8% to $1.822 billion compared to $1.674 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 29.3% to approximately $231.7 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.71 compared to net income of $179.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share for the full year 2017.
We experienced good growth in all of our service lines for the quarter, with residential up 7.8%, commercial pest control rose 5.9%, and termite and ancillary rose 8.2%. 2018 was a good year for Rollins as we continued to build our global presence through acquisitions, both domestically and overseas.
In the U.K., we expanded our footprint with the acquisition of 3 prime companies: Guardian Pest Control, AMES Group and Kestrel Pest Control. We also achieved an important milestone for the company when we acquired Aardwolf Pestkare. This is Rollins' first company-owned operation in Singapore.
In the U.S., we acquired OPC Pest Control, a premier pest control company in Kentucky, and we also made small tuck-in acquisitions. And at year-end, we had added a total of 38 companies to our roster. We also continued to expand the Orkin brand internationally with the addition of franchises in South America, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and other locations. The Orkin brand is now represented in 57 countries throughout 86 international franchises.
As we enter 2019, strategic acquisitions will remain a focus of our growth strategy. We're extremely pleased to have announced earlier this month our agreement to acquire Clark Pest Control. Headquartered in Lodi, California, Clark has operations in over 20 locations in California and Nevada. Founded by Charlie Clark in 1950, the company has grown to be the eighth largest pest control provider in the U.S. Clark recorded revenues of $130 million in 2017. The company is also growing at a faster rate than we are as well as a faster rate than the overall pest control industry.
I first visited with the company over 20 years ago and I was fortunate enough to meet Charlie Clark, an icon in our industry. We have admired the company throughout all of this time. The Clark acquisition will be the largest in our company's history. John will provide more details on this acquisition, but I wanted to express our enthusiasm in acquiring this fine company and personally welcome their team to the Rollins' family.
I'd now like to turn the call over to John."

As Gary noted, we are very pleased to have Clark Pest Control join our family. The Clark team is a natural fit for Rollins, sharing the same values that we do, more on that later.
They service customers through more than 20 branch location in North and Southern California and Nevada. Clark Pest Control is stronger in the upper central valley in Northern California areas than Orkin and our other brands. It was very interesting to learn during our due diligence process how closely linked Clark and our biggest brand, Orkin, are in their history. As you may know, Orkin was founded by Otto Orkin in 1901 but didn't expand to the West Coast prior to the Rollins' purchase in 1964. Meanwhile, Charlie Clark founded Clark Pest Control in California in 1950 and patterned Clark on some of the foundational principles of quality customer service delivered by well-trained people just as Otto Orkin did. Both companies have certainly retained those principles of quality service, delivered by well-trained team members today. Clark has long been recognized as a premier pest control company in residential, commercial and termite services in the markets it serves. Their strong culture of customer service has been aided by very high employee retention rates and has resulted in a loyal and expanding customer base.
 We are aware that owners have a choice when they look to sell their business, and there are 4 very important factors that come into play. What is best for their family, their employees and their customers as well as receiving value for the company? We take each of those into account and customize our acquisition plan to fit those factors. What was apparent in our discussions with Clark from the beginning is how deeply they care about what would happen to their employees and customers following the sale. They, like us, recognize how important their people are to their success and also, like us, are dedicated to continually improving both the employee and the customer experience.
Over time, we have distinguished ourselves with our acquisitions where key management and employees remain on afterward. And it is one reason why Rollins has gained a reputation of being the industry's acquirer of choice. Sellers know they can trust us to live up to our word once we have closed on a purchase. We even invite potential targets to reach out to the brands we have acquired as well as the ones we have lost out on to see if they're happy or not.
In addition to Clark Pest Control, expanding our presence in California and Nevada, we believe the company provides significant opportunities for Rollins and Clark to learn from each other, which we have repeatedly expressed as one of our primary objectives with our acquisitions.
Potential opportunities we have encountered previously include materials and supplies purchasing, better vehicle-leasing arrangements, training, employee benefits, and lower technology and communication expenses to name a few. Rollins will fund the acquisition using a combination of cash and debt. Eddie will go into further financial details related to this acquisition in a few minutes. Clark Pest Control, under the leadership of long-term Clark team member Robert Baker, will join our Specialty Brands group led by Jerry Gahlhoff. Brands in this group include HomeTeam, Western, Waltham, Northwest Exterminating and OPC Services.
Jerry and I have had the privilege of visiting every Clark operation to meet with their employees and personally welcome them to Rollins. We wanted them to know that they are valued and how much we look forward to working with them to further advance their great brand.
I will now turn the call back over to Eddie."
300753,597020790,1640333,"Rollins, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Before I get into our quarterly and year-end numbers, I wanted to reiterate the positive impact of our enhanced employee benefits. Our people are so pleased with the investments that we made in 2018. And looking back, this was absolutely",1449,"Thank you, John. Before I get into our quarterly and year-end numbers, I wanted to reiterate the positive impact of our enhanced employee benefits. Our people are so pleased with the investments that we made in 2018. And looking back, this was absolutely the right decision and have been reinforced by the positive results that they have produced for the year. As you may recall, in April, we increased our 401(k) match and provided stock grants to our employees, which added about $10 million to our expense for the year. But this recognition of their impact on our business is rippling through our results.
Our recent leadership meeting in Atlanta was the first that we have had -- first that we've held since rolling this announcement out last April. The comments of many of the over 100 participants were overwhelmingly positive and appreciated. 
I want to share a few of the positive changes that we have seen. All employees want to work for an employer of choice. Our employee retention rate had the best year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter in 2018 since 2016. As you know, during that same time period, the unemployment rate has fallen from 4.7% down to 3.9% in December of 2018.
Investing in our people is one of the components that has helped us in this area. We've also often talked about how important our technicians are in their relationship with our customers. Our improved employee retention has translated directly to higher customer retention in Q4 and for all of 2018. Our organic growth rates, again, ticked to historic highs as a result of better technician and customer retention. Enhancing our employee benefits will continue to drive improvements in employee and customer retention for years to come.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and keys to the quarter included record organic growth rates, piloting testing of the BOSS rollout in Canada, and as I just mentioned, improvements in our employee retention rate tied to our enhanced employee benefits.
Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $444.6 million was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 million. Income before income taxes increased 4.3% to $71.5 million from $68.5 million in 2017. Expense and depreciation increased during the quarter as we continued to roll out and began testing BOSS in Canada. Net income rose 51.1% to $51 million, and EPS increased 60% to $0.16 per diluted share compared to $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $87.8 million, up 5.1% over Q4 of 2017. As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we continue to make sizable acquisitions that will impact our depreciation and amortization.
For the 12 months that ended December 31, we produced record revenues of $1.822 billion, which was an increase of 8.8% over the same time period last year. Income before income taxes increased 5.5% to $310.7 million, and net income rose 29.3% to $231.7 million compared to 2017. EPS increased 29.1% to $0.71 per share compared to $0.55 per share in 2017. EBITDA was $377.3 million in 2018 compared to $350.8 million in 2017, up 7.5%.
Our financial health enables us to be -- I'm sorry, enables us to continue to be nimble and improve our business. Companies that did not anticipate change and take advantage of market opportunities and seek ways to make it easier for your customers to do business with you do not drive, and in some cases, do not survive. The past 50 years have shown that Rollins has successfully managed for the long-term, and the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control is a great example of that.
John gave some good color on the Clark's impending purchase based on his time working on this acquisition and spending a lot of time visiting their employees. But let's shift our attention to what we know about the financial impact of the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We anticipate closing sometime in Q1 of 2019, subject to obtaining regulatory clearance.
For all of you that have asked would we be willing to leverage our balance sheet, this is your deal. While we plan to use cash for a portion of the purchase, we will be taking on debt in the form of a term loan tied to LIBOR to supplement the rest. This deal makes taking on debt worthwhile for us, and again, is investing in our future for decades to come.
The company is very profitable, but with the goodwill amortization, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1 but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once we close on the deal, we will share more related to the anticipated impact of this acquisition on our total Rollins results moving forward.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increased 7.2% and included 1.6% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.6% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 7.8%. Commercial pest control, which made up 39% of our revenue, was up 5.9%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 8.2%. Both residential and termite benefit from our OPC acquisition. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.6%, and from that, residential was up 6.8%, commercial increased 3.2%, and termite improved by 7.5%.
Back to my earlier point on employee and customer retention, for the full year, total organic revenue grew 5.3% and is the fastest organic growth rate in over 5 years. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total, we grew 7.1%, residential grew 8%, commercial pest control was up 5%, and termite improved 8.5%.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 50.2%, up slightly from 50% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency and routing and scheduling, even as we have last efforts that began 18 months ago. Average miles driven per vehicle in our Orkin fleet were down an additional 2.6% year-over-year. Fleet expenses increased $3 million or 13.6% for the quarter, driven by moderated but still higher price per gallon costs and increased leased vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and onetime employee stock grants.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.7 million to $16.6 million, an increase of 11.3%. Depreciation increased $790,000 due to acquisitions, equipment purchases and continued BOSS rollout. While amortization of intangible assets increased $900,000 due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions.
Sales, general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter increased $12.1 million or 9.8% to $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues, up 0.7% from $123.7 million or 29.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter 2017. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily driven to higher sales salaries of $3.1 million due to higher sales commissions, which is tied to our record organic growth rate; $3 million additional expense in administrative salaries, attributable to amortization of restricted stock grants and expense associated with acquisitions; personnel-related increase of $1.9 million from the enhanced 401(k) benefits. In Q4, we saw an increase in the 401(k) match as more employees benefited from these enhancements.
The full year SG&A number increased 9.4% and came in at 30.2% of revenue compared to 30.1% of revenue in 2017. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2018, we spent $76.7 million on acquisitions compared to $130.2 million the same period last year, which included Northwest Exterminating, and as we continued to find good quality pest control companies and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We paid $152.7 million on dividends, which included a special dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which was an increase of 25.2%. We have $27.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 9.7% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition.
We ended the period with $115.5 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on March 11, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 11, 2019. The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

I think a little bit of that is going to be attributable to our team here, just continue to develop the relationships and being ready to go when companies are ready to go. Good quality companies are coming to the table, which, of course, we want to be a part of. We continue to expand our look into different geographies to find the right fit. As you know, Singapore this year, in 2016, the U.K. we entered, and we added some more into the U.K. this year. But I think a lot of it also has to do with the actual industry itself. It's an industry that started after World War II. Some of the original owners are having to make life decisions on what they want to do with their company. And John talked a little bit about that on how different companies make those different decisions. So I would say, we're still probably 2 to 3 -- in the next few years, I would say, we'd still be in that type of a cycle, having to deal with different companies making different decisions on what they want to do. Whether it is to hand it off and keep it within their family or whether it is to do something different and be able to pass it along. But I think there's going to continue to be opportunity. With this pending acquisition for us, it'll be our largest in our history. So it's hard to sit here and say today how active we will be. But when the right opportunity presents itself, we're still absolutely going to be at the table. But we're going to have a lot of good work to do, having to do with this, depending on what we have."

But if you take a look at the total, total numbers, there won't be anywhere near the significance of the impact from a year-over-year perspective. The sales, our commission piece, we just don't know what's going on with that. As long as we continue to find ways to be able to grow, and we continue to hit these new highs as far as our organic growth rates are concerned and our sales folks are executing, we may continue to see dollars that are in that area. On the fleet side, we're all seeing the price of fuel that continues to kind of stabilize now and when we start lapping a year-over-year, there should be less of a headwind or maybe even possibly a benefit with that. So I would say that a lot of the items that we have are onetime items on the expense side from the employee benefits. But then we also have other things that, I think, intuitively we will all see that are kind of moving in the right direction.

I think when take a look at the items that drove the ""disappointment"" that might be out there, based on what you said, having to do with the stock price.

We look at an investment in our employees, the 401(k) benefits, we look at IT spend, rolling out enhancements in Canada where we've already seen improvements in the U.S. when we did that. Our largest acquisition and the costs that are related to that largest acquisition that's impending in our company's history and the costs that are related to that.

This pest activity can be measured by digital and phone lead flow. March and early April confirmed that spring is arriving and service demand in sales will begin to increase significantly. The good news is that we have already added to and trained our seasonal staff to meet this increasing demand. Although, we were hampered with the coldest first quarter in the past several years, we had many important operational successes. These were the result of our previous investments that will benefit our employees and customers. This quarter we achieved major improvements in both employee and customer retention. 
Our new technologies developed to improve our service delivery through our customer routing and scheduling. And as you recall, we enhanced our 401(k) and other benefits. These actions are both paying dividends, and I'll explain further in a minutes. 
Revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $429.1 million compared to $408.7 million for the first quarter of 2018. 
Net income was $44.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $48.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter last year. 
Eddie will provide greater details on these results. Looking at our business lines in the quarter, residential pest control grew 4.9%, commercial pest control rose 4.6%, and termite and ancillary was up 4.8%. 
Regrettably, our increased employee staffing costs, additional [indiscernible] expense another seasonal related expenses grew faster than our revenue. 
As promised, I wanted to take a minute to elaborate on our enhanced 401(k) plan and other improved employee benefits I referred to earlier. 
As a service company, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset. And last year, as a result of the opportunity provided by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, we elected to provide our employees with better benefits that would have a long-term positive effect for them and their families and our company. 
One of the most important benefits we selected to help achieve these goals was Rollins increasing their employee match to our 401(k) program. Prior to January 1, 2018, we matched employee contributions 50% on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for the contributions up to 6%. In responses to this benefit changes far exceeded our expectations with many more employees now enrolled in the 401(k) program for the first time and many increasing their contribution to the plan. 
As a result, we now have a higher percentage of employees participating in our plan. The incremental cost is approximately $1 million a quarter, however, this confirms our employees that we are investing more in their future. 
We believe that it also indicates that their confidence in the future of Rollins and the promise it has for them and their families. 
Other benefits, we also doubled the number of college scholarships, increased paid time off and provided company stock to many selected tenured employees. 
Any day we are anticipating regulator clearance for our acquisition of Clark Pest Control. A leading pest management company located in Lodi, California. Clark's is the nation's eighth largest pest management company according to PCT magazine. 
The company operates in 26 locations it's residents and businesses throughout California and Northwest, Nevada. Clark has a history of excellent service and a very loyal customer base. We are thrilled to have them join our team and are confident that Clark will continue to grow and be a major contributor to Rollins. 
This acquisition is the largest in our company's history today. Let me now turn the call over to John."

We have reasons to celebrate and much of that centers around our team members. Gary has already recapped the highlights of our employee benefit enhancements, so I thought it put it this year how these improvements are helping our operations. 
For the Orkin brand alone, we saw a 33% improvement in our most important metric, employee retention. This myth that we supported from Orkin 224 fewer people. This saves time spent searching for replacement team members as well as dollars spent for training those new hires. 
We also saw similar employee retention improvements in nearly every other one of our brands and what we all know is a very tough labor market. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to announce that Rollins and Northwest Pest Control has been awarded a 2019 top workplaces award by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This marked the third consecutive year for Rollins having been honored for this award and the seventh year -- seventh consecutive year for Northwest recognition. 
Rollins ranks 16 in the largest business category and Northwest rank 20th in the list of midsize companies. This honor is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture including alignment, execution, leadership and connection and more than 4,300 Metro Atlantic companies participated in this program and 80,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. 
Many thanks go to our leadership team who deserve the credit for Rollins achieving this honor. We were also pleased that Rollins was recognized again this year by Training Magazine as one of the top 125 training organizations in the world. This marks the 14th time since 2003 that either Rollins or Orkin has achieved this honor, and we still rank as the only pest management company to have received this acknowledgment. 
As we have said many times in the past, the training experience our employees receive is vitally important to their retention and a successful launch to their careers. 
It is important to us to know that they know that they have a future at our company not just a job. 
Over the past year, Rollins introduce quite a few new or enhanced curriculum for employees. 
Improvements in our residential and commercial service processes, leadership development, multiunit leadership development and customer service to name a few. 
Jerry Gahlhoff, President of Rollins Specialty Brands and VP of human resources sums it up well. Rollins believes it's employees are the core of developing relationships with customers and employee training is a critical component of ensuring we are well equipped to support and serve those customers. Gary just noted how excited we are to have [indiscernible] join our Rollins family. For those of you who may not be aware, our previous acquisition -- the largest acquisition was HomeTeam, more than a decade ago. At the time of that acquisition, they were the fourth largest pest control company in the U.S. 
Over the years, HomeTeam has continued to thrive, growing to 52 branches and over 1,700 team members, quite a growth accomplishment by any standard. 
From a financial perspective, HomeTeam performs extremely well. Over the past 5 years, HomeTeam's revenue has grown nearly 8% on average, faster than both the industry and for Rollins in total. 
Additionally, operating improvements -- operating profits have grown at a faster rate than Rollins overall and their the customer base is growing faster as well. 
HomeTeam currently provides services to 18 of the top 20 homebuilders and is the #1 pest control company servicing homebuilders across the nation. 
They have installed the [indiscernible] Pest Management system in more than 1 million homes. 
HomeTeam has also been recognized for the quality of its work, having been the recipient of the highly coveted David Weekley partner of choice quality award for the past several years. 
HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley homes in the 13 cities where it conducts business, and these awards are a testimony to HomeTeam's focus on providing top-notch quality and exceptional service to its business partners. 
HomeTeam is just 1 example defined companies that we have added to our family of brands over the years. Thank you all for your time, and I will turn the call over to Eddie."

The extreme weather and late spring coupled with several one-time items contributed to uncharacteristic results for the first quarter. We were well staffed to provide our best-in-class service between a much publicized polar vortex and the substantial rain in all of California in the Midwest, pest demand did not materialize in a normal fashion. For example, there was several days in February that were impacted with snow in unlikely places like [indiscernible] and Las Vegas. 
January was a good month, February a difficult -- a very difficult month and March was a more normal month. Even with late snow in many areas of the country, we see April is off to a favorable start. 
With the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and [indiscernible] of the quarter included impacts of extreme weather patterns, continued improvements in both employee and customer retention and as mentioned, several one-time items that impacted bottom line profitability. 
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $429.1 million was an increase of 5% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $408.7 million. 
Income before income taxes decreased 5.3% to $56.1 million from $59.2 million in 2018. 
Expense grew faster than revenue as we prepared for the spring season that was delayed this year. This impacted most of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 8.9% to $44.2 million, and earnings per share decrease 6.7% to $0.14 per diluted share compared to $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. 
EBITDA was $72.5 million, down 4.9% over Q1 of 2018. 
As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we add Clark and more customer amortization to the Rollins family brand. 
Let's take a look at the one-time items that impacted the quarter. 
A normal quarterly may see one of these items and not being a material impact. But as several of these were coupled with weather-related lower pest demand, this affected our overall gross margin. The material items were: $775,000 of professional services expenses was incurred to work through the unexpected Federal Trade Commission process for the Clark acquisition. Moving forward, we expect to have an additional $250,000 in expense in Q2. 
Contractors involved with the fast deleasing accounting change impacted Q1 by $335,000 and will impact future quarters by similar amounts. 
With the growth of our international operations coupled by the strong U.S. dollar against foreign currency, the difference year-over-year was $1.3 million. Our tax rate in 2019 of 21% compared to 18% last year impacted the bottom line by over $1 million. 
And the last item to note is the increase in 401(k) and stock equity investing. While we had not planned to see any material difference year-over-year, we were very pleased to see more employees participating at a higher rate based on the popularity of the enhanced benefits that Gary mentioned. 372 additional employees began participating in our 401(k) program brining our participation rate up to 95.8% in 2019. 
Additionally, the overall contribution per person increased as well. These items impacted both CSC and SG&A for the quarter. The combinations of 401(k) increase and vesting of equity awards granted last year impacted the quarter by an additional $1.5 million. 
As Gary mentioned, we are very excited about the pending acquisition of Clark. And last quarter, John spent some time sharing what [indiscernible] while visiting employees of his great company. For the first time in my tenure at Rollins, the bankers are very happy with us. 
We will be taking out a $250 million term loan tied to LIBOR using our credit line for $100 million and using cash for the remainder of the purchases. I say purchases because we will complete 2 separate transactions to close the deal. We will first close on the real estate portion of the owned Clark properties, which equated to about 21 properties and then close on the pest business portion of Clark. We will begin paying these loans back as early as July of this year with an intent to have all loans paid off within the next 2 years. 
As I mentioned last quarter, Clark is very profitable. But with the depreciation, goodwill amortization and loan interest, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1 but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once the valuation is complete, we will be able to share more specifics of the financial impact. But we know that amortization of customer contracts will increase our overall amortization between 25% and 35% year-over-year in 2019. 
We will share more related to the anticipated impact of this deal on our total Rollins results moving forward. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 5%, that included 1.1% from several acquisitions and the remaining 3.9% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 4.9%. Commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 4.6%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 4.8%. 
Both residential pest control and termite were most impacted by the severe weather. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.9%. And from that, residential pest control was up 4.5%, commercial increased -- commercial pest control increased 2.5%, and termite and ancillary grew 4.3%. 
In total, gross margin was down slightly to 49.4% from 49.6% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced an increase in administrative salaries as we amortize the employer restricted share grants provided last year. 
Additionally, fleet expenses were up as leased vehicle expenses were higher as well as increases in contractor expense associated with the new lease accounting pronouncement that I mentioned in my opening. 
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $200,000 to $16.7 million, a decrease of 1.4%. Depreciation increased $40,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $600,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
These numbers will change substantially once we complete the acquisition of Clark. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $13 million or 10.3% to $139.5 million or 10.3% of revenues, up 1.6 percentage points from $126.5 million or [ 13.9%  ] of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily due to the increases in administrative salaries, which were up due to amortization of restricted share grants from 2018. 
Sales salaries and sales increase during the period and personnel related expenses related to the employee 401(k) match that I discussed. 
Additionally, there were increases in professional services related to contractors used to update the leases for the new accounting standard. 
As for our cash position, for the period ending March 31, 2019, we spent $7 million on acquisitions compared to $43.2 million the same period last year, which did include OPC. 
We paid $34.3 million on dividend and have $6.5 million of capital expenditures, which was up 5.7% from 2018, primarily related to planned IT upgrade such as our BOSS Canada rollout. We ended the period with $116.6 million in cash, of which $60.5 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business May 10, 2019. 
The cash dividend is a 12.9% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. 
Before I wrap up, I do want to remind you that we made the decision to derisk our pension and move it off of our books about 12 months ago. We are on schedule for this to finalize in the third quarter. 
At that time, we will have a significant one-time noncash accounting charge related to the finalization of this process. 
I will share more details in Q2 as we get closer to the end of this process. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

As most of you know our first quarter is a transitional quarter that leads into our higher demand SCs. Although we really talk about the impact of weather on the business, this year mother nature was particularly unkind unleashing what some referred to as the polar vortex, delivering some of the coldest temperatures to parts of the country in over 2 decades. 
But as we sit around here, spring always comes, sometimes it's earlier, sometimes it's later. We much prefer earlier, however. But it always comes and with it comes higher pest activity. 
This pest activity can be measured by digital and phone lead flow. March and early April confirmed that spring is arriving and service demand and sales will begin to increase significantly. The good news is that we have already added to and trained our seasonal staff to meet this increasing demand. Although we were hampered with the coldest first quarter in the past several years, we had many important operational successes. These were the result of our previous investments that will benefit our employees and customers. This quarter we achieved major improvements in both employee and customer retention. 
Our new technologies developed to improve our service delivery through our customer routing and scheduling, and as you recall, we enhanced our 401(k) and other benefits. These actions are both paying dividends, and I'll explain further in a minute. 
Revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $429.1 million compared to $408.7 million for the first quarter of 2018. 
Net income was $44.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $48.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter last year.  
Eddie will provide greater details on these results. Looking at our business lines in the quarter, residential pest control grew 4.9%, commercial pest control rose 4.6%, and termite and ancillary was up 4.8%. 
Regrettably, our increased employee staffing cost, additional vehicle expense another season-related expenses grew faster than our revenue. 
As promised, I wanted to take a minute to elaborate on our enhanced 401(k) plan and other improved employee benefits I referred to earlier. 
As a service company, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset. And last year, as a result of the opportunity provided by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, we elected to provide our employees with better benefits that would have a long-term positive effect for them and their families and our company. 
One of the most important benefits we selected to help achieve these goals was Rollins increasing their employee match to our 401(k) program. Prior to January 1, 2018, we matched employee contributions 50% on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for the contributions up to 6%. In response, this benefit change has far exceeded our expectations with many more employees now enrolled in the 401(k) program for the first time and many increasing their contribution to the plan. 
As a result, we now have a higher percentage of employees participating in our plan. The incremental cost is approximately $1 million a quarter, however, this confirms our employees that we are investing more in their future. 
We believe that it also indicates that their confidence in the future of Rollins and the promise it has for them and their families. 
Other benefits. We also doubled the number of college scholarships, increased paid time-off and provided company stock to many selected tenured employees. 
Any day we are anticipating regulatory clearance for our acquisition of Clark Pest Control, a leading pest management company located in Lodi, California. Clark is the nation's eighth largest pest management company according to PCT magazine. 
The company operates in 26 locations. It serves residents and businesses throughout California and Northwest Nevada. Clark has a history of excellent service and a very loyal customer base. We are thrilled to have them join our team and are confident that Clark will continue to grow and be a major contributor to Rollins. This acquisition is the largest in our company's history to date. Let me now turn the call over to John."

While our first quarter results were not what we expected, we have reasons to celebrate and most of that centers around our team members. Gary has already recapped the highlights of our employee benefit enhancements, so I thought to report that this year how these improvements are helping our operations. 
For the Orkin brand alone, we saw a 33% improvement in our most important metric, employee retention. This meant that we separated from Orkin 224 fewer people. This saves time spent searching for replacement team members as well as dollars spent for training those new hires. 
We also saw similar employee retention improvements in nearly every other one of our brands in what we all know is a very tough labor market. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to announce that Rollins and Northwest pest control has been awarded a 2019 top workplaces award by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This marked the third consecutive year for Rollins having been honored for this award and the seventh year -- seventh consecutive year for Northwest recognition. 
Rollins ranks 16th in the largest business category and Northwest ranks 20th in the list of midsize companies. This honor is based solely on employees satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture including alignment, execution, leadership and connection and more than 4,300 Metro Atlantic companies participated in this program and 80,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. 
Many thanks go to our leadership team who deserve the credit for Rollins achieving this honor. We were also pleased that Rollins was recognized again this year by Training Magazine as one of the top 125 training organizations in the world. This marks the 14th time since 2003 that either Rollins or Orkin has achieved this honor, and we still rank as the only pest management company to have received this acknowledgment. 
As we have said many times in the past, the training experience our employees receive is vitally important to their retention and a successful launch to their careers. It is important to us to know that they know that they have future at our company, not just a job. 
Over the past year, Rollins introduced quite a few new or enhanced curriculum for employees, improvements in our residential and commercial service processes, leadership development, multiunit leadership development and customer service, to name a few. 
Jerry Gahlhoff, President of Rollins Specialty Brands and VP of Human Resources sums it up well. Rollins believes it's employees who are at the core of developing relationships with customers and employee training is a critical component of ensuring we are well equipped to support and serve those customers. Gary just noted how excited we are to have Clark join our Rollins family. For those of you who may not be aware, our previous acquisition -- the largest acquisition was HomeTeam, more than a decade ago. At the time of that acquisition, they were the fourth largest pest control company in the U.S. 
Over the years, HomeTeam has continued to thrive, growing to 52 branches and over 1,700 team members, quite a growth accomplishment by any standard. 
From a financial perspective, HomeTeam performs extremely well. Over the past 5 years, HomeTeam's revenue has grown nearly 8% on average, faster than both the industry and for Rollins in total. 
Additionally, operating improvements -- operating profits have grown at a faster rate than Rollins overall and their customer base is growing faster as well. HomeTeam currently provides services to 18 of the top 20 homebuilders and is the #1 pest control company servicing homebuilders across the nation. They have installed the Taexx Pest Management system in more than 1 million homes. 
HomeTeam has also been recognized for the quality of its work, having been the recipient of the highly coveted David Weekley partner of choice quality award for the past several years. 
HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes in the 13 cities where it conducts business, and these awards are a testimony to HomeTeam's focus on providing top-notch quality and exceptional service to its business partners. 
HomeTeam is just 1 example of the fine companies that we have added to our family of brands over the years. Thank you all for your time, and I will turn the call over to Eddie."

The extreme weather and late spring coupled with several one-time items contributed to uncharacteristic results for the first quarter. We were well staffed to provide our best-in-class service between a much publicized polar vortex and the substantial rain in all of California and the Midwest. Pest demand did not materialize in a normal fashion. For example, there was several days in February that were impacted with snow in unlikely places like Pasadena and Las Vegas. 
January was a good month, February a difficult -- a very difficult month and March was a more normal month. Even with late snow in many areas of the country, we see April is off to a favorable start. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and peak of the quarter included impacts of extreme weather patterns, continued improvements in both employee and customer retention and as mentioned, several one-time items that impacted bottom line profitability. 
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $429.1 million was an increase of 5% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $408.7 million. 
Income before income taxes decreased 5.3% to $56.1 million from $59.2 million in 2018. 
Expense grew faster than revenue as we prepared for the spring season that was delayed this year. This impacted most of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 8.9% to $44.2 million, and earnings per share decreased 6.7% to $0.14 per diluted share compared to $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. 
EBITDA was $72.5 million, down 4.9% over Q1 of 2018. 
As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we add Clark and more customer amortization to the Rollins family brands.
Let's take a look at the one-time items that impacted the quarter. 
A normal quarter may see one of these items and not being a material impact. But as several of these were coupled with weather-related lower pest demand, this affected our overall gross margin. The material items were: $775,000 of professional services expenses was incurred to work through the unexpected Federal Trade Commission process for the Clark acquisition. Moving forward, we expect to have an additional $250,000 in expense in Q2. 
Contractors involved with the fast deleasing accounting change impacted Q1 by $335,000 and will impact future quarters by a similar amount. 
With the growth of our international operations, coupled by the strong U.S. dollar against foreign currency, the difference year-over-year was $1.3 million. Our tax rate in 2019 of 21% compared to 18% last year impacted the bottom line by over $1 million. 
And the last item to note is the increase in 401(k) and stock equity divesting. While we have not planned to see any material difference year-over-year, we were very pleased to see more employees participating at a higher rate based on the popularity of the enhanced benefits that Gary mentioned. 372 additional employees began participating in our 401(k) program, bringing our participation rate up to 95.8% in 2019. 
Additionally, the overall contribution per person increased as well. These items impacted both CST and SG&A for the quarter. The combinations of 401(k) increase and divesting of equity awards granted last year impacted the quarter by an additional $1.5 million. 
As Gary mentioned, we are very excited about the pending acquisition of Clark. And last quarter, John spent some time sharing what he and Jerry learned while visiting employees of this great company. For the first time in my tenure at Rollins, the bankers are very happy with us. 
We will be taking out a $250 million term loan tied to LIBOR using our credit line for $100 million and using cash for the remainder of the purchases. I say purchases because we will complete 2 separate transactions to close the deal. We will first close on the real estate portion of the owned Clark properties, which equated to about 21 properties and then close on the pest business portion of Clark. We will begin paying these loans back as early as July of this year with an intent to have all loans paid off within the next 2 years. 
As I mentioned last quarter, Clark is very profitable. But with the depreciation, goodwill amortization and loan interest, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1 but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once the valuation is complete, we will be able to share more specifics of the financial impact. But we know that amortization of customer contracts will increase our overall amortization between 25% and 35% year-over-year in 2019. 
We will share more related to the anticipated impact of this deal on our total Rollins results moving forward. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the first quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 5%, that included 1.1% from several acquisitions and the remaining 3.9% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 4.9%. Commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 4.6%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 4.8%. 
Both residential pest control and termite were most impacted by the severe weather. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.9%. And from that, residential pest control was up 4.5%, commercial increased -- commercial pest control increased 2.5%, and termite and ancillary grew 4.3%. 
In total, gross margin was down slightly to 49.4% from 49.6% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced an increase in administrative salaries as we amortize the employee-restricted share grants provided last year. 
Additionally, fleet expenses were up as leased vehicle expenses were higher as well as increases in contractor expense associated with the new lease accounting pronouncement that I mentioned in my opening. 
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $200,000 to $16.7 million, a decrease of 1.4%. Depreciation increased $40,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $600,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. These numbers will change substantially once we complete the acquisition of Clark. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $13 million or 10.3% to $139.5 million or 10.3% of revenues, up 1.6 percentage points from $126.5 million or 30.9% (sic) [ 13.9% ] of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily due to the increases in administrative salaries, which were up due to amortization of restricted share grants from 2018, sales salaries as sales increased during the period and personnel-related expenses related to the employee 401(k) match that I discussed. 
Additionally, there were increases in professional services related to contractors used to update the leases for the new accounting standard. 
As for our cash position, for the period ending March 31, 2019, we spent $7 million on acquisitions compared to $43.2 million the same period last year, which did include OPC. 
We paid $34.3 million on dividend and had $6.5 million of capital expenditures, which was up 5.7% from 2018, primarily related to planned IT upgrade such as our BOSS Canada rollout. We ended the period with $116.6 million in cash, of which $60.5 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business May 10, 2019. 
The cash dividend is a 12.9% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. 
Before I wrap up, I do want to remind you that we made the decision to derisk our pension and move it off of our books about 12 months ago. We are on schedule for this to finalize in the third quarter. 
At that time, we will have a significant one-time noncash accounting charge related to the finalization of this process. 
I will share more details in Q2 as we get closer to the end of this process. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Pasadena snowing, Las Vegas is snowing. There was more rain in Los Angeles and in Southern California than there was in Seattle during the first quarter. So it's just anomalies that just occurred that we're not accustomed to. When it rains every day in Southern California, we can't do termite work. We can't do a lot of pest work that we can do in those types of situations.

They just consider her to be a part of their family, an extension of their family. And I think that's more of what we're trying to get to is how supportive we are with people's lifestyle.

As most of you know, our first quarter is a transitional quarter that leads into our higher-demand pest season. Although we rarely talk about the impact of weather on the business, this year, Mother Nature was particularly unkind, unleas",696,"Thank you, Eddie. As most of you know, our first quarter is a transitional quarter that leads into our higher-demand pest season. Although we rarely talk about the impact of weather on the business, this year, Mother Nature was particularly unkind, unleashing what some referred to as the polar vortex, delivering some of the coldest temperatures to parts of the country in over 2 decades. 
But as we say around here, ""Spring always comes, sometimes it's earlier, sometimes it's later."" We much prefer earlier, however. But it always comes and with it comes higher pest activity. 
This pest activity can be measured by our digital and phone lead flow. March and early April confirmed that spring is arriving and service demand and sales will begin to increase significantly. The good news is that we have already added to and trained our seasonal staff to meet this increasing demand. Although we were hampered with the coldest first quarter in the past several years, we had many important operational successes. These were the result of our previous investments that will benefit our employees and customers. This quarter, we achieved major improvements in both employee and customer retention. 
Our new technologies developed to improve our service delivery through our customer routing and scheduling, and as you recall, we enhanced our 401(k) and other benefits. These actions are both paying dividends, and I'll explain further in a minute. 
Revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $429.1 million compared to $408.7 million for the first quarter of 2018. 
Net income was $44.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $48.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter last year.  
Eddie will provide greater details on these results. Looking at our business lines in the quarter, residential pest control grew 4.9%, commercial pest control rose 4.6% and termite and ancillary was up 4.8%. 
Regrettably, our increased employee staffing cost, additional vehicle expense and other season-related expenses grew faster than our revenue. 
As promised, I wanted to take a minute to elaborate on our enhanced 401(k) plan and other improved employee benefits I referred to earlier. 
As a service company, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset. And last year, as a result of the opportunity provided by the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, we elected to provide our employees with better benefits that would have a long-term positive effect for them and their families and our company. 
One of the most important benefits we selected to help achieve these goals was Rollins increasing their employee match to our 401(k) program. Prior to January 1, 2018, we matched employee contributions 50% on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for the contributions up to 6%. The response to this benefit change has far exceeded our expectations, with many more employees now enrolled in the 401(k) program for the first time and many increasing their contribution to the plan. 
As a result, we now have a higher percentage of employees participating in our plan. The incremental cost is approximately $1 million a quarter. However, this confirms to our employees that we are investing more in their future. 
We believe that it also indicates that their confidence in the future of Rollins and the promise it has for them and their families. 
Other benefits, we also doubled the number of college scholarships, increased paid time-off and provided company stock to many selected tenured employees. 
Any day we are anticipating regulatory clearance for our acquisition of Clark Pest Control, a leading pest management company located in Lodi, California. Clark is the nation's eighth largest pest management company according to PCT magazine. 
The company operates in 26 locations. It serves residents and businesses throughout California and Northwest Nevada. Clark has a history of excellent service and a very loyal customer base. We are thrilled to have them join our team and are confident that Clark will continue to grow and be a major contributor to Rollins. This acquisition is the largest in our company's history to date. Let me now turn the call over to John."

While our first quarter results were not what we expected, we have reasons to celebrate and most of that centers around our team members. Gary has already recapped the highlights of our employee benefit enhancements, so I thought it important to share how these improvements are helping our operations. 
For the Orkin brand alone, we saw a 33% improvement in our most important metric, employee retention. This meant that we separated from Orkin 224 fewer people. This saves time spent searching for replacement team members as well as dollars spent for training those new hires. 
We also saw similar employee retention improvements in nearly every other one of our brands in what we all know is a very tough labor market. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to announce that Rollins and Northwest pest control has been awarded a 2019 Top Workplaces award by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This marked the third consecutive year for Rollins having been honored for this award and the seventh year -- seventh consecutive year for Northwest's recognition. Rollins ranked 16th in the large business category and Northwest ranked 20th in the list of midsize companies. This honor is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture including alignment, execution, leadership and connection and more than 4,300 Metro Atlanta companies participated in this program and 80,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. 
Many thanks go to our leadership team who deserve the credit for Rollins achieving this honor. We were also pleased that Rollins was recognized again this year by Training Magazine as one of the top 125 training organizations in the world. This marks the 14th time since 2003 that either Rollins or Orkin has achieved this honor, and we still rank as the only pest management company to have received this acknowledgment. 
As we have said many times in the past, the training experience our employees receive is vitally important to their retention and a successful launch to their careers. It is important to us to know that they know that they have a future at our company, not just a job. 
Over the past year, Rollins introduced quite a few new or enhanced curriculum for employees, improvements in our residential and commercial service processes, leadership development, multiunit leadership development and customer service, to name a few. 
Jerry Gahlhoff, President of Rollins Specialty Brands and VP of Human Resources, sums it up well: ""Rollins believes its employees are at the core of developing relationships with customers and employee training is a critical component of ensuring we are well-equipped to support and serve those customers."" Gary just noted how excited we are to have Clark join our Rollins family. For those of you who may not be aware, our previous acquisition -- largest acquisition was HomeTeam, more than a decade ago. At the time of that acquisition, they were the fourth largest pest control company in the U.S. 
Over the years, HomeTeam has continued to thrive, growing to 52 branches and over 1,700 team members, quite a growth accomplishment by any standard. From a financial perspective, HomeTeam performs extremely well. Over the past 5 years, HomeTeam's revenue has grown nearly 8% on average, faster than both the industry and for Rollins in total. 
Additionally, operating improvements -- operating profits have grown at a faster rate than Rollins overall and their customer base is growing faster as well. HomeTeam currently provides services to 18 of the top 20 homebuilders and is the #1 pest control company servicing homebuilders across the nation. They have installed the Taexx Pest Management system in more than 1 million homes. 
HomeTeam has also been recognized for the quality of its work, having been the recipient of the highly-coveted David Weekley Partners of Choice quality award for the past several years. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes in the 13 cities where it conducts business, and these awards are a testimony to HomeTeam's focus on providing top-notch quality and exceptional service to its business partners. 
HomeTeam is just 1 example of the fine companies that we have added to our family of brands over the years. Thank you all for your time, and I will turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,608730176,1704423,"Rollins, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The extreme weather and late spring, coupled with several one-time items, contributed to uncharacteristic results for the first quarter. We were well-staffed to provide our best-in-class service. Between a much publicized polar vortex and",1369,"Thank you, John. The extreme weather and late spring, coupled with several one-time items, contributed to uncharacteristic results for the first quarter. We were well-staffed to provide our best-in-class service. Between a much publicized polar vortex and the substantial rain in all of California and the Midwest, pest demand did not materialize in a normal fashion. For example, there was several days in February that were impacted with snow in unlikely places like Pasadena and Las Vegas. 
January was a good month, February a difficult -- a very difficult month and March was a more normal month. Even with late snow in many areas of the country, we see April is off to a favorable start. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included impacts of extreme weather patterns, continued improvements in both employee and customer retention and as mentioned, several one-time items that impacted bottom line profitability. 
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $429.1 million was an increase of 5% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $408.7 million. 
Income before income taxes decreased 5.3% to $56.1 million from $59.2 million in 2018. 
Expense grew faster than revenue as we prepared for the spring season that was delayed this year. This impacted most of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 8.9% to $44.2 million, and earnings per share decreased 6.7% to $0.14 per diluted share compared to $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. 
EBITDA was $72.5 million, down 4.9% over Q1 of 2018. 
As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we add Clark and more customer amortization to the Rollins family of brands.
Let's take a look at the one-time items that impacted the quarter. A normal quarter may see one of these items and not be a material impact. But as several of these were coupled with weather-related lower pest demand, this affected our overall gross margin. The material items were: $775,000 of professional services expense was incurred to work through the unexpected Federal Trade Commission process for the Clark acquisition. Moving forward, we expect to have an additional $250,000 in expense in Q2. 
Contractors involved with the FASB leasing accounting change impacted Q1 by $335,000 and will impact future quarters by a similar amount. 
With the growth of our international operations, coupled by the strong U.S. dollar against foreign currency, the difference year-over-year was $1.3 million. Our tax rate in 2019 of 21% compared to 18% last year impacted the bottom line by over $1 million. 
And the last item to note is the increase in 401(k) and stock equity vesting. While we had not planned to see any material difference year-over-year, we were very pleased to see more employees participating at a higher rate based on the popularity of the enhanced benefits that Gary mentioned. 372 additional employees began participating in our 401(k) program, bringing our participation rate up to 95.8% in 2019. 
Additionally, the overall contribution per person increased as well. These items impacted both CSP and SG&A for the quarter. The combination of the 401(k) increase and the vesting of equity awards granted last year impacted the quarter by an additional $1.5 million. 
As Gary mentioned, we are very excited about the pending acquisition of Clark. And last quarter, John spent some time sharing what he and Jerry learned while visiting employees of this great company. For the first time in my tenure at Rollins, the bankers are very happy with us. 
We will be taking out a $250 million term loan tied to LIBOR, using our credit line for $100 million and using cash for the remainder of the purchases. I say purchases because we will complete 2 separate transactions to close the deal. We will first close on the real estate portion of the owned Clark properties, which equated to about 21 properties, and then close on the pest business portion of Clark. We will begin paying these loans back as early as July of this year, with an intent to have all loans paid off within the next 2 years. 
As I mentioned last quarter, Clark is very profitable. But with the depreciation, goodwill amortization and loan interest, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1, but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once the valuation is complete, we will be able to share more specifics of the financial impact. But we know that amortization of customer contracts will increase our overall amortization between 25% and 35% year-over-year in 2019. We will share more related to the anticipated impact of this deal on our total Rollins results moving forward. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 5%, that included 1.1% from several acquisitions and the remaining 3.9% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 4.9%. Commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 4.6%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 4.8%. 
Both residential pest control and termite were most impacted by the severe weather. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.9%. And from that, residential pest control was up 4.5%, commercial increased -- commercial pest control increased 2.5%, and termite and ancillary grew 4.3%. 
In total, gross margin was down slightly to 49.4% from 49.6% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced an increase in administrative salaries as we amortized the employee-restricted share grants provided last year. 
Additionally, fleet expenses were up as leased vehicle expenses were higher as well as increases in contractor expense associated with the new lease accounting pronouncement that I mentioned in my opening. 
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $200,000 to $16.7 million, a decrease of 1.4%. Depreciation increased $400,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $600,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. These numbers will change substantially once we complete the acquisition of Clark. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $13 million or 10.3% to $139.5 million or 10.3% (sic) [ 32.5% ] of revenues, up 1.6 percentage points from $126.5 million or 30.9% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily due to the increases in administrative salaries, which were up due to amortization of restricted share grants from 2018, sales salaries as sales increased during the period and personnel-related expenses related to the employee 401(k) match that I discussed. 
Additionally, there were increases in professional services related to contractors used to update the leases for the new accounting standard. 
As for our cash position, for the period ending March 31, 2019, we spent $7 million on acquisitions compared to $43.2 million the same period last year, which did include OPC. 
We paid $34.3 million on dividends and had $6.5 million of capital expenditures, which was up 5.7% from 2018, primarily related to planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout. We ended the period with $116.6 million in cash, of which $60.5 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business May 10, 2019. 
The cash dividend is a 12.9% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. 
Before I wrap up, I do want to remind you that we made the decision to derisk our pension and move it off of our books about 12 months ago. We are on schedule for this to finalize in the third quarter. 
At that time, we will have a significant one-time noncash accounting charge related to the finalization of this process. 
I will share more details in Q2 as we get closer to the end of this process. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

So it's just anomalies that just occurred that we're not accustomed to. When it rains every day in Southern California, we can't do termite work. We can't do a lot of pest work that we can't do in those types of situations.

As most of you know, our first quarter is a transitional quarter that leads into our higher-demand pest season. Although we rarely talk about the impact of weather on the business, this year, Mother Nature was particularly unkind, unleas",696,"Thank you, Eddie. As most of you know, our first quarter is a transitional quarter that leads into our higher-demand pest season. Although we rarely talk about the impact of weather on the business, this year, Mother Nature was particularly unkind, unleashing what some referred to as the polar vortex, delivering some of the coldest temperatures to parts of the country in over 2 decades. 
But as we say around here, ""Spring always comes, sometimes it's earlier, sometimes it's later."" We much prefer earlier, however. But it always comes and with it comes higher pest activity. 
This pest activity can be measured by our digital and phone lead flow. March and early April confirmed that spring is arriving and service demand and sales will begin to increase significantly. The good news is that we have already added to and trained our seasonal staff to meet this increasing demand. Although we were hampered with the coldest first quarter in the past several years, we had many important operational successes. These were the result of our previous investments that will benefit our employees and customers. This quarter, we achieved major improvements in both employee and customer retention. 
Our new technologies developed to improve our service delivery through our customer routing and scheduling, and as you recall, we enhanced our 401(k) and other benefits. These actions are both paying dividends, and I'll explain further in a minute. Revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $429.1 million compared to $408.7 million for the first quarter of 2018. Net income was $44.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $48.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter last year.  
Eddie will provide greater details on these results. Looking at our business lines in the quarter, residential pest control grew 4.9%, commercial pest control rose 4.6% and termite and ancillary was up 4.8%. Regrettably, our increased employee staffing cost, additional vehicle expense and other season-related expenses grew faster than our revenue. As promised, I wanted to take a minute to elaborate on our enhanced 401(k) plan and other improved employee benefits I referred to earlier. 
As a service company, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset. And last year, as a result of the opportunity provided by the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, we elected to provide our employees with better benefits that would have a long-term positive effect for them and their families and our company. 
One of the most important benefits we selected to help achieve these goals was Rollins increasing their employee match to our 401(k) program. Prior to January 1, 2018, we matched employee contributions 50% on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for the contributions up to 6%. The response to this benefit change has far exceeded our expectations, with many more employees now enrolled in the 401(k) program for the first time and many increasing their contribution to the plan. 
As a result, we now have a higher percentage of employees participating in our plan. The incremental cost is approximately $1 million a quarter. However, this confirms to our employees that we are investing more in their future. We believe that it also indicates that their confidence in the future of Rollins and the promise it has for them and their families. Other benefits, we also doubled the number of college scholarships, increased paid time-off and provided company stock to many selected tenured employees. 
Any day we are anticipating regulatory clearance for our acquisition of Clark Pest Control, a leading pest management company located in Lodi, California. Clark is the nation's eighth largest pest management company according to PCT magazine. 
The company operates in 26 locations. It serves residents and businesses throughout California and Northwest Nevada. Clark has a history of excellent service and a very loyal customer base. We are thrilled to have them join our team and are confident that Clark will continue to grow and be a major contributor to Rollins. This acquisition is the largest in our company's history to date. Let me now turn the call over to John."

While our first quarter results were not what we expected, we have reasons to celebrate and most of that centers around our team members. Gary has already recapped the highlights of our employee benefit enhancements, so I thought it important to share how these improvements are helping our operations. 
For the Orkin brand alone, we saw a 33% improvement in our most important metric, employee retention. This meant that we separated from Orkin 224 fewer people. This saves time spent searching for replacement team members as well as dollars spent for training those new hires. We also saw similar employee retention improvements in nearly every other one of our brands in what we all know is a very tough labor market. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to announce that Rollins and Northwest pest control has been awarded a 2019 Top Workplaces award by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This marked the third consecutive year for Rollins having been honored for this award and the seventh year -- seventh consecutive year for Northwest's recognition. Rollins ranked 16th in the large business category and Northwest ranked 20th in the list of midsize companies. This honor is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture including alignment, execution, leadership and connection and more than 4,300 Metro Atlanta companies participated in this program and 80,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. 
Many thanks go to our leadership team who deserve the credit for Rollins achieving this honor. We were also pleased that Rollins was recognized again this year by Training Magazine as one of the top 125 training organizations in the world. This marks the 14th time since 2003 that either Rollins or Orkin has achieved this honor, and we still rank as the only pest management company to have received this acknowledgment. 
As we have said many times in the past, the training experience our employees receive is vitally important to their retention and a successful launch to their careers. It is important to us to know that they know that they have a future at our company, not just a job. 
Over the past year, Rollins introduced quite a few new or enhanced curriculum for employees, improvements in our residential and commercial service processes, leadership development, multiunit leadership development and customer service, to name a few. 
Jerry Gahlhoff, President of Rollins Specialty Brands and VP of Human Resources, sums it up well: ""Rollins believes its employees are at the core of developing relationships with customers and employee training is a critical component of ensuring we are well-equipped to support and serve those customers."" Gary just noted how excited we are to have Clark join our Rollins family. For those of you who may not be aware, our previous acquisition -- largest acquisition was HomeTeam, more than a decade ago. At the time of that acquisition, they were the fourth largest pest control company in the U.S. 
Over the years, HomeTeam has continued to thrive, growing to 52 branches and over 1,700 team members, quite a growth accomplishment by any standard. From a financial perspective, HomeTeam performs extremely well. Over the past 5 years, HomeTeam's revenue has grown nearly 8% on average, faster than both the industry and for Rollins in total. 
Additionally, operating improvements -- operating profits have grown at a faster rate than Rollins overall and their customer base is growing faster as well. HomeTeam currently provides services to 18 of the top 20 homebuilders and is the #1 pest control company servicing homebuilders across the nation. They have installed the Taexx Pest Management system in more than 1 million homes. 
HomeTeam has also been recognized for the quality of its work, having been the recipient of the highly-coveted David Weekley Partners of Choice quality award for the past several years. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes in the 13 cities where it conducts business, and these awards are a testimony to HomeTeam's focus on providing top-notch quality and exceptional service to its business partners. 
HomeTeam is just one example of the fine companies that we have added to our family of brands over the years. Thank you all for your time, and I will turn the call over to Eddie."

The extreme weather and late spring, coupled with several onetime items, contributed to uncharacteristic results for the first quarter. We were well-staffed to provide our best-in-class service. Between a much publicized polar vortex and",1369,"Thank you, John. The extreme weather and late spring, coupled with several onetime items, contributed to uncharacteristic results for the first quarter. We were well-staffed to provide our best-in-class service. Between a much publicized polar vortex and the substantial rain in all of California and the Midwest, pest demand did not materialize in a normal fashion. For example, there was several days in February that were impacted with snow in unlikely places like Pasadena and Las Vegas. 
January was a good month, February a difficult -- a very difficult month and March was a more normal month. Even with late snow in many areas of the country, we see April is off to a favorable start. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included impacts of extreme weather patterns, continued improvements in both employee and customer retention and as mentioned, several onetime items that impacted bottom line profitability. 
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $429.1 million was an increase of 5% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $408.7 million. Income before income taxes decreased 5.3% to $56.1 million from $59.2 million in 2018. 
Expense grew faster than revenue as we prepared for the spring season that was delayed this year. This impacted most of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 8.9% to $44.2 million, and earnings per share decreased 6.7% to $0.14 per diluted share compared to $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. EBITDA was $72.5 million, down 4.9% over Q1 of 2018. As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we add Clark and more customer amortization to the Rollins family of brands.
Let's take a look at the onetime items that impacted the quarter. A normal quarter may see one of these items and not be a material impact. But as several of these were coupled with weather-related lower pest demand, this affected our overall gross margin. The material items were: $775,000 of professional services expense was incurred to work through the unexpected Federal Trade Commission process for the Clark acquisition. Moving forward, we expect to have an additional $250,000 in expense in Q2. 
Contractors involved with the FASB leasing accounting change impacted Q1 by $335,000 and will impact future quarters by a similar amount. With the growth of our international operations, coupled by the strong U.S. dollar against foreign currency, the difference year-over-year was $1.3 million. Our tax rate in 2019 of 21% compared to 18% last year impacted the bottom line by over $1 million. 
And the last item to note is the increase in 401(k) and stock equity vesting. While we had not planned to see any material difference year-over-year, we were very pleased to see more employees participating at a higher rate based on the popularity of the enhanced benefits that Gary mentioned. 372 additional employees began participating in our 401(k) program, bringing our participation rate up to 95.8% in 2019. 
Additionally, the overall contribution per person increased as well. These items impacted both CSP and SG&A for the quarter. The combination of the 401(k) increase and the vesting of equity awards granted last year impacted the quarter by an additional $1.5 million. 
As Gary mentioned, we are very excited about the pending acquisition of Clark. And last quarter, John spent some time sharing what he and Jerry learned while visiting employees of this great company. For the first time in my tenure at Rollins, the bankers are very happy with us. 
We will be taking out a $250 million term loan tied to LIBOR, using our credit line for $100 million and using cash for the remainder of the purchases. I say purchases because we will complete 2 separate transactions to close the deal. We will first close on the real estate portion of the owned Clark properties, which equated to about 21 properties, and then close on the pest business portion of Clark. We will begin paying these loans back as early as July of this year, with an intent to have all loans paid off within the next 2 years. 
As I mentioned last quarter, Clark is very profitable. But with the depreciation, goodwill amortization and loan interest, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1, but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once the valuation is complete, we will be able to share more specifics of the financial impact. But we know that amortization of customer contracts will increase our overall amortization between 25% and 35% year-over-year in 2019. We will share more related to the anticipated impact of this deal on our total Rollins results moving forward. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 5% that included 1.1% from several acquisitions and the remaining 3.9% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 4.9%. Commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 4.6%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 4.8%. 
Both residential pest control and termite were most impacted by the severe weather. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.9%. And from that, residential pest control was up 4.5%, commercial increased -- commercial pest control increased 2.5%, and termite and ancillary grew 4.3%. 
In total, gross margin was down slightly to 49.4% from 49.6% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced an increase in administrative salaries as we amortized the employee-restricted share grants provided last year. Additionally, fleet expenses were up as leased vehicle expenses were higher as well as increases in contractor expense associated with the new lease accounting pronouncement that I mentioned in my opening. 
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $200,000 to $16.7 million, a decrease of 1.4%. Depreciation increased $400,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $600,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. These numbers will change substantially once we complete the acquisition of Clark. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $13 million or 10.3% to $139.5 million or 10.3% (sic) [ 32.5% ] of revenues, up 1.6 percentage points from $126.5 million or 30.9% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily due to the increases in administrative salaries, which were up due to amortization of restricted share grants from 2018, sales salaries as sales increased during the period and personnel-related expenses related to the employee 401(k) match that I discussed. 
Additionally, there were increases in professional services related to contractors used to update the leases for the new accounting standard. As for our cash position, for the period ending March 31, 2019, we spent $7 million on acquisitions compared to $43.2 million the same period last year, which did include OPC. 
We paid $34.3 million on dividends and had $6.5 million of capital expenditures, which was up 5.7% from 2018, primarily related to planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout. We ended the period with $116.6 million in cash, of which $60.5 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business May 10, 2019. The cash dividend is a 12.9% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. 
Before I wrap up, I do want to remind you that we made the decision to derisk our pension and move it off of our books about 12 months ago. We are on schedule for this to finalize in the third quarter. At that time, we will have a significant onetime noncash accounting charge related to the finalization of this process. 
I will share more details in Q2 as we get closer to the end of this process. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

And in -- like an example that I gave, Pasadena is snowing, Las Vegas is snowing. There was more rain in Los Angeles and in Southern California than there was in Seattle during the first quarter. So it's just anomalies that just occurred that we're not accustomed to. When it rains every day in Southern California, we can't do termite work. We can't do a lot of pest work that we can't do in those types of situations.

But they performed very well for us. And in some cases those were newer acquisitions: OPC, newer acquisition; Northwest, newer acquisition. We've increased our footprint in the U.K., Singapore last year, newer acquisition, that have all performed very well for us.

They just consider her to be a part of their family, an extension of their family. And I think that's more of what we're trying to get to, is how supportive we are with people's lifestyle.

I mean I was in a hotel in Chicago and I had the television on the news channel and all of a sudden, the television kind of went silent and after a few seconds, I looked up and then it was one of our ads and then it was the one with all of the adults on the back deck having a party. And they we're talking in muffled tones, which by and large, there wasn't much sound coming from that commercial.

As you would expect, we're disappointed with our performance for the quarter. We, like most other pest control companies, have both strong and weaker growth periods with some seasonal timing of certainty. Unfortunately, our situation is not like retail where everyone knows when the Christmas comes. Historically, we had handled these weaker periods by adjusting our cost, our headcount after the season to the more appropriate level. 
This year was unique because of the fact that the season was very late. Thankfully, July looks strong, so we have a makeup opportunity. The second quarter revenues rose 9.1% to $524.2 million compared to revenues of $480.5 million in the second quarter of last year. 
Net income declined 3.3% to $63.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $65 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period last year. 
When adjusted for the onetime Clark acquisition expense and foreign currency exchange, it would be $0.21 per share. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other financial results in a few minutes. 
Revenues for the first 6 months rose 7.2% to $953.2 million compared to $889.2 million for the same period last year. Net income decreased 5.6% to approximately $107.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $114.1 million with earnings per diluted share or $0.35 for the first 6 months of last year. 
We have a number of initiatives that will enhance Rollins' future growth and margin improvement. I'd like to talk more specifically about these business improvements and how they will impact Rollins. As we approach becoming a multibillion dollar company, the timing is right to make strategic investments that will prepare us for the future. Some of these business investments and innovations are: if you recall, we improved our 401(k) and broaden stock grants in 2018 year-end. We estimate that this is an additional expense of $6 million for 2019 but we believe that there is not a better use of our resources. 
As a people business, our ability to recruit and retain excellent employees is paramount. 
This investment has helped generate a strong improvement in employee retention for our first 2 quarters. 
Next, we've increased and expanded our investment in customer routing and scheduling. This technology directly benefits our employees and customers. We now guide our technician to the customer's address with a service day that's planned from start to finish. The technicians have better organized days and our customers receive better communication and appointment reliability. 
And most recent technical innovation in this area is the adoption of glimpse, a software that enables us to communicate with the customer via text or e-mail as to their upcoming service date, time of service. Our customers now even have the ability to see where the technician is, when in route to their account. As a result of these tools, we have created a better relationship with our customers and a better job for our technicians. 
The customer is better serve and has the capability to change their service date and time as their circumstances dictate. This investment has also contributed to our employees and customers' retention improvements and reduction of miles driven. As you recall from our earlier costs that we are transitioning our pension to an insurance provider. When complete, this will create a significant administrative expense savings. 
Eddie will discuss this in more details about this initiative in a few minutes. 
As I mentioned, we've made and are making these improvements and innovations to better prepare for the company's future and to help mitigate some of the challenges we experienced due to the seasonality of our business. 
Expanding our recurring revenue accomplishes this: As you would expect there's been a significant amount of expenditures in effort that are associated with these initiatives that have and will have a positive effect on the company. 
I would add that our company's track record has shown that we don't have is spend yourself rich culture of Rollins and we expect a favorable return on our new-and-improved program. With the Clark acquisition complete, we will continue to evaluate other acquisition prospects as adding great companies and brands will remain one of our primary objectives. 
John will now update you on the Clark acquisition and our other plans."
300753,626751588,1777272,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2019",2019-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success. We've had an integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years. All of which have contributed in many ways to a profitable growth. Historically,",552,"Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success. We've had an integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years. All of which have contributed in many ways to a profitable growth. Historically, the larger acquisitions require a bit longer to integrate, as you might expect, and that will apply to Clark as well. 
Once fully incorporated though, the long-term benefits of these acquisitions provide excellent top and bottom line growth expansion of our company and the ability to provide customers with additional pest-control-related services. These acquired companies benefit from our Internet of experience, greater purchasing power and transportable technology. Clark is on track with our business plan and we expect them to be our highly successful addition to our family of brands. 
Gary and I are heading out there next week where we will meet with their team and check in on their progress. We are excited about Clark as the majority of the branch branches are in northern California and their addition dramatically strengthens our company's presence in this area. 
As you may recall, we added 2018 with the best employee retention we've experienced in our recent history, and the first 2 quarters of 2019 continued on that trajectory. 
Further, as you would expect, employee retention directly correlates with customer retention. Improving and enhancing the benefit package for our team members obviously helps retain our people. 
However, investments in technology and process helps greatly here too. As we have slightly -- I'm sorry, as we have simply improved team member job satisfaction with these various tools. 
A service technician's relationship with their customers is extremely important to ensuring customer loyalty and expanding our customer base. As Gary has shared, our customer routing and scheduling capabilities are a large contributor to improvement in this area as it enables technicians to expand their service time. This enables them to better fulfill their customers needs and in some cases add, additional customers to their route. For our field personnel, this technology provides additional benefits in the form of reducing the amount of time spent behind the wheel. 
For the second quarter, we again, had nice improvements in driving efficiency as measured by miles per stock. 
Average miles driven per stock and Orkin fleet were down 4% year-over-year, and we have had 17 consecutive months of miles per stock reductions. One last item related to technology we can full implementation of our human resource information system during the first half of the year. And this system, when fully utilized, solves a number of pain points for our field employees. 
We expect to see continued benefits through 2019 and beyond from these various technology initiatives mentioned. 
On another note, this time of year, we get a lot of questions about how our mosquito business is doing. 
Although, a relatively small part of our overall business at this point, this service line continues to grow and is in part, driven by increased concern and public awareness around disease borne issues, including Zika, personnel and other diseases. Year-over-year, our mosquito service has grown percent and we expect continued growth in the future as we gain greater cross-sell penetration of our largest pest control customer base. Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials."

I'll begin our Q1 call discussing the strength of April only to have May and June demand look significantly different. We come to you again, sharing what we know at this point with seom pent-up demand for previous quarters coming through",1854,"Thank you, John. I'll begin our Q1 call discussing the strength of April only to have May and June demand look significantly different. We come to you again, sharing what we know at this point with seom pent-up demand for previous quarters coming through so far in July. 
Our second quarter results can be defined by looking at the past, the present and the future. Each of these time periods have a significant piece of the results that we're reporting to you today and we'll continue to build on results for quarters and years to come. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included: Significant negative currency exchange through a stronger U.S. dollar and our growing international business; continued year-to-date improvements in both employee and customer retention; and uneven pest demand that carry -- that Gary mentioned in the opening. To be more specific, the past events of our investment enhanced benefits for our employees will impact this quarter by about $1.9 million. 
$1.5 million for the 401(k) and $40,000 for the special restricted stock and about $1.75 million for the remaining quarters of 2019 as we add Clark to our 401(k) plan. 
While the best thing for this special stock grants was a onetime event this year, the 401(k) will be impacted moving forward for employees joining or leaving the plan or increasing or reducing their contribution as we move forward. John just spoke about the lasting outcome that this investment has made on our employee retention, which is a key driver to our long-term success. 
Again, as a reminder, these items impact both CSP and SG&A, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
In addition to the items that Gary and John mentioned a few minutes ago, our present and future is, and will be, significantly impacted by our acquisition of Clark. We are on pace with the integration and have already made positive changes related to vehicles, procurement and benefits plans. Clark will go live on our fleet systems on the 2nd week of August, which will be a step to getting their fleet operating margins more in line with Rollins levels. 
Based on past acquisitions, we have the opportunity to improve the fleet margins over 20%. Our Rollins support staff has visited with Clark and [indiscernible] California and we are learning so much. From a recent visit, I had a chance to listen to a customer calls, and I was truly impressed with their call center function, their interaction with the customers and its efficiency. When I visited the Stockton branch, I gained a deeper understanding of how they run their operations with such an impressively high level. 
Since that time, several Clark employees have visited Atlanta to learn more about Rollins and how they can support our integration efforts. 
In addition, to the reduced fleet expense, other items that will impact the P&L in Q3 and Q4 related to Clark are: Depreciation will be up $1.9 million per quarter for buildings and vehicles added. We have received a draft of the valuation of Clark. And including Clark, as well as the other 40 plus acquisitions that we've made over the last 18 months, amortization has increased $8.8 million. 
We're in a position to share more details related to the purchase interest expense now that we have worked through some of the specifics. 
For Q2, we had $1.9 million of interest for the partial quarter of borrowing. For Q3, we estimate $2.7 million as we have already started paying down the loans and have added an interest rate swap to fix a portion of the loan at a rate of roughly 45 bps below LIBOR. 
We will continue to pay down the loans and estimate a reduction of interest expense to $2.5 million for Q4. 
Again, we've already started to pay off the outstanding loans and our plans are to be debt-free by early 2022. 
Finally, our professional services were up $1.9 million for Q2, significantly higher than originally anticipated at the time of our Q1 call due to an in-depth regulatory review, and the need for economic experts to support our case for acquisition as well as expertise related to the real estate transactions. There will be an additional $400,000 of expense related to this in Q3 and we anticipate nothing in Q4. 
For those of you that had a chance to review the release of our 8-K related to the Clark audited 2018 financials, I wanted to share some additional details. 
From the bottom line results that we shared, there are approximately $11 million which will be excluded as we move forward in time; $5.7 million of that is for rents that are no longer paid since we now own the properties; an additional $2.4 million on elimination of vehicles and transportation and net other expenses in addition. These expenses for normal private company expenses and there was agreement to make these changes prior to the finalizing of the acquisition. 
There will be several margin points of gains from these changes that will be added to additional changes that we add from our integration of the business, previously mentioned. One additional item with the clarity will have benefits will be in our free cash flow. 
Including the acquisition and the benefits of Clark, we will have approximately $40 million increase in free cash flow for 2019. 
Even with lower-than-average net income in Q1 and Q2, this increase is in line with the previous few years. 
For 2019, as we've shared on prior calls, the earnings per share will be flat but we believe the deal will be accretive by half penny for the full year 2020. Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenues of $524 million was an increase of 9.1% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $480.5 million. 
There was an accounting change that increased our franchise revenue recognition last year by approximately $1.5 million that did not occur in 2019. 
Income before income taxes improved from Q1 but decreased 3.6% to $87 million from $90.2 million in 2018. Favorable expense adjustments were made but demand still lagged in several areas during the quarter. 
This impacted all of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 1.9% to $64.3 million; earnings per share was $0.20 per diluted share in line with $0.20 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018; EBITDA was $109 million, up 2.2% over Q2 2018; EBITDA is the best measure for the near term with the addition of Clark. 
Revenue for the 6 months ended June 30, 2019 showed West $953 million, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's second quarter is from $889.2 million. 
Income before income taxes decreased 4.3% to $143 million from $149.4 million in 2018. Net income fell 4.9% to $108.5 million, and earnings per share was $0.33, down 5.7% from the 2018 number of $0.35. 
EBITDA was $181.5 million, down [ 0.07 ] compared to 2018. I detailed out some of the past and present, now let's turn the discussion to the future. As first mentioned several quarters ago, we're in the final stages of transitioning are fully funded pension plan off of our books. 
There's so many positive impacts from this step, which include: Managing the volatility of the assets, the elimination of that: The elimination of the annual $5 million payment to fund the plan: And the elimination of the daily administrative management of the plan. 
In addition, since our plan is approximately 104% funded, which equates to roughly $6 million, these assets will be deployed in other areas of our business that will be discussed on our Q3 earnings call. 
Most of the financial impact from the pension transition will occur in Q3. First, we will have a significant noncash charge of approximately $76 million pretax, which will be pension expense in Q3, which will equate to approximately $0.20 per share after taxes. This $76 million expense is the accounting treatment of the accumulative sum of unrealized losses associated with our plan. 
Net of tax, the loss will be approximately $64 million. The tax treatment is consistent with the method other companies would apply. The tax effect from the transition of the pension plan will be a reduction in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and for the year. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the second quarter. 
As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 9.1% included 5.5% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 3.6% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 11.1%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 7.7%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 9.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.6%. And from that, residential was up 4.6%; commercial increased 2.8%; and termite and ancillary grew 4.6%. 
In total, gross margin was down slightly to 51.7% from 52% prior year's quarter. 
The quarter experienced increases in most expenses due to acquisitions as well as an administrator salaries due to amortization of the employee special restricted share grants from the prior year and increased salaries. Service salaries, materials and supplies and fleet increased with production for the period. 
Taking out these onetime items, gross margin would have been 51.8%. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $3.8 million to $20.1 million, an increase of 12.9%. 
Depreciation increased $1.5 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.2 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $18.5 million or 12.9% to $161.9 million or 30.9% of revenues, up 1.1 percentage point from $143.4 million or 29.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2019. 
The increase in the percent of revenue, as I discussed, is primarily due to acquisitions and the amortization of restricted shares from the 2018 special grant distribution and increases in the 401(k) expense. Taking out these onetime items, SG&A would've been 30.3%. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2019, we spent $414.8 million on acquisitions compared to $54.6 million the same period last year. We paid $68.7 million on dividends and had $13.4 million of CapEx, which was up 5.7% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our Boss Canada rollout and building improvements. 
We ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which $67.8 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business August 9, 2019. 
The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

As you would expect, we're disappointed with our performance for the quarter.

As you would expect, we're disappointed with our performance for the quarter. We, like most other pest control companies, have both strong and weaker growth periods with some seasonal timing uncertainty. Unfortunately, our situation is not like retail where everyone knows when the Christmas comes. Historically, we had handled these weaker periods by adjusting our cost, or headcount after the season to the more appropriate level. 
This year was unique because of the fact that the season was very late. Thankfully, July looks strong, so we have a makeup opportunity. The second quarter revenues rose 9.1% to $524.2 million compared to revenues of $480.5 million in the second quarter of last year. 
Net income declined 3.3% to $63.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $65 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period last year. 
When adjusted for the onetime Clark acquisition expense and foreign currency exchange, it would be $0.21 per share. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other financial results in a few minutes. 
Revenues for the first 6 months rose 7.2% to $953.2 million compared to $889.2 million for the same period last year. Net income decreased 5.6% to approximately $107.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $114.1 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.35 for the first 6 months of last year. 
We have a number of initiatives that will enhance Rollins' future growth and margin improvement. I'd like to talk more specifically about these business improvements and how they will impact Rollins. As we approach becoming a multibillion-dollar company, the timing is right to make strategic investments that will prepare us for the future. Some of these business investments and innovations are: if you recall, we improved our 401(k) and broadened stock grants at 2018 year-end. We estimate that there's an additional expense of $6 million for 2019 but we believe that there is not a better use of our resources. As a people business, our ability to recruit and retain excellent employees is paramount. 
This investment has helped generate a strong improvement in employee retention for our first 2 quarters. 
Next, we've increased and expanded our investment in customer routing and scheduling. This technology directly benefits our employees and customers. We now guide our technician to the customer's address with a service day that's planned from start to finish. The technicians have better organized days and our customers receive better communication and appointment reliability. 
A most recent technical innovation in this area is the adoption of Glympse, a software that enables us to communicate with the customer via text or e-mail as to their upcoming service date and time of service. Our customers now even have the ability to see where the technician is when en route to their account. As a result of these tools, we have created a better relationship with our customers and a better job for our technicians. 
The customer is better served and has the capability to change their service date and time as their circumstances dictate. This investment has also contributed to our employees and customers' retention improvements and reduction of miles driven. 
As you recall from our earlier calls that we are transitioning our pension to an insurance provider. When complete, this will create a significant administrative expense saving. Eddie will discuss this in more details about this initiative in a few minutes. 
As I mentioned, we've made and are making these improvements and innovations to better prepare for the company's future and to help mitigate some of the challenges we experience due to the seasonality of our business. Expanding our recurring revenue accomplishes this. As you would expect there's been a significant amount of expenditures and effort that are associated with these initiatives that have and will have a positive effect on the company. 
I would add that our company's track record has shown that we don't have a spend-yourself-rich culture at Rollins and we expect a favorable return on our new and improved programs. With the Clark acquisition complete, we will continue to evaluate other acquisition prospects as adding great companies and brands will remain one of our primary objectives. 
John will now update you on the Clark acquisition and our other plans."
300753,626751588,1777645,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2019",2019-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success. We've had an integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years, all of which have contributed in many ways to our profitable growth. Historicall",554,"Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success. We've had an integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years, all of which have contributed in many ways to our profitable growth. Historically, the larger acquisitions require a bit longer to integrate, as you might expect, and that will apply to Clark as well. 
Once fully incorporated though, the long-term benefits of these acquisitions provide excellent top and bottom line growth expansion of our company and the ability to provide customers with additional pest-control-related services. These acquired companies benefit from our internet of experience, greater purchasing power and transportable technology. Clark is on track with our business plan and we expect them to be a highly successful addition to our family of brands. 
Gary and I are heading out there next week where we will meet with their team and check in on their progress. We are excited about Clark as the majority of their branch branches are in northern California and their addition dramatically strengthens our company's presence in this area. 
As you may recall, we ended 2018 with the best employee retention we've experienced in our recent history, and the first 2 quarters of 2019 continued on that trajectory. 
Further, as you would expect, employee retention directly correlates with customer retention. Improving and enhancing the benefit package for our team members obviously helps retain our people. However, investments in technology and process helps greatly here too as we have slightly -- I'm sorry, as we have simply improved team member job satisfaction with these various tools. A service technician's relationship with their customers is extremely important to ensuring customer loyalty and expanding our customer base. As Gary has shared, our customer routing and scheduling capabilities are a large contributor to improvement in this area as it enables technicians to expand their service time. This enables them to better fulfill their customers' needs and in some cases add, additional customers to their route. For our field personnel, this technology provides additional benefits in the form of reducing the amount of time spent behind the wheel. 
For the second quarter, we again had nice improvements in driving efficiency as measured by miles per stop. Average miles driven per stop in our Orkin fleet were down 4% year-over-year, and we have had 17 consecutive months of miles per stop reductions. 
One last item related to technology. We gained full implementation of our human resource information system during the first half of the year. And this system, when fully utilized, solves a number of pain points for our field employees. We expect to see continued benefits through 2019 and beyond from these various technology initiatives mentioned. 
On another note, this time of year, we get a lot of questions about how our mosquito business is doing. Although, a relatively small part of our overall business at this point, this service line continues to grow and is in part, driven by increased concern and public awareness around disease-borne issues, including Zika, West Nile and other diseases. Year-over-year, our mosquito service has grown over 35% and we expect continued growth in the future as we gain greater cross-sell penetration of our large pest control customer base. Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials."

I began our Q1 call discussing the strength of April only to have May and June demand look significantly different. We come to you again, sharing what we know at this point with some pent-up demand from previous quarters coming through so far in July. 
Our second quarter results can be defined by looking at the past, the present and the future. Each of these time periods has a significant piece of the results that we're reporting to you today and we'll continue to build on results for quarters and years to come. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included: Significant negative currency exchange through a stronger U.S. dollar and our growing international business; continued year-to-date improvements in both employee and customer retention; and uneven pest demand that carry -- that Gary mentioned in the opening. To be more specific, the past events of our investment and enhanced benefits for our employees will impact this quarter by about $1.9 million, $1.5 million for the 401(k) and $400,000 for the special restricted stock and about $1.75 million for the remaining quarters of 2019 as we add Clark to our 401(k) plan. 
While divesting of the special stock grants was a onetime event this year, the 401(k) will be impacted moving forward by employees joining or leaving the plan or increasing or reducing their contribution as we move forward. John just spoke about the lasting outcome that this investment has made on our employee retention, which is a key driver to our long-term success. Again, as a reminder, these items impact both CSP and SG&A, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
In addition to the items that Gary and John mentioned a few minutes ago, our present and future is, and will be, significantly impacted by our acquisition of Clark. We're on pace with our integration and have already made positive changes related to vehicles, procurement and benefits plans. Clark will go live on our fleet systems the 2nd week of August, which will be a step to getting their fleet operating margins more in line with Rollins' levels. 
Based on past acquisitions, we have the opportunity to improve the fleet margins over 20%. Rollins support staff have visited with Clark in Lodi, California and we are learning so much. From my recent visit, I had a chance to listen to customer calls, and I was truly impressed with their call center function, the interaction with the customers and its efficiency. When I visited the Stockton branch, I gained a deeper understanding of how they run their operations at such an impressively high level. 
Since that time, several Clark employees have visited Atlanta to learn more about Rollins and how they can support our integration efforts. 
In addition to the reduced fleet expense, other items that will impact the P&L in Q3 and Q4 related to Clark are: Depreciation will be up $1.9 million per quarter for buildings and vehicles added. We have received a draft of evaluation of Clark, and including Clark as well as the other 40 plus acquisitions that we've made over the last 18 months, amortization has increased $8.8 million. 
We are in a position to share more details related to the purchase interest expense now that we have worked through some of the specifics. For Q2, we have $1.9 million of interest for the partial quarter of borrowing. For Q3, we estimate $2.7 million as we have already started paying down the loans and have added an interest rate swap to fix a portion of the loan at a rate of roughly 45 bps below LIBOR. We will continue to pay down the loans and estimate a reduction of interest expense to $2.5 million for Q4. 
Again, we've already started to pay off the outstanding loans and our plans are to be debt-free by early 2022. 
Finally, professional services were up $1.9 million for Q2, significantly higher than originally anticipated at the time of our Q1 call due to an in-depth regulatory review, and the need for economic experts to support our case for acquisition as well as expertise related to the real estate transactions. There will be an additional $400,000 of expense related to this in Q3 and we anticipate nothing in Q4. 
For those of you that had a chance to review the release of our 8-K related to the Clark audited 2018 financials, I wanted to share some additional details. 
From the bottom line results that were shared, there are approximately $11 million which will be excluded as we move forward in time; $5.7 million of that is for rents that are no longer paid since we now own the properties; an additional $2.4 million on elimination of vehicles and transportation and other expenses in addition. These expenses were normal private company expenses and there was agreement to make these changes prior to the finalizing of the acquisition. 
There will be several margin points of gains from these changes that will be added to additional changes that we add from our integration of the business, previously mentioned. 
One additional item where the Clark deal will have benefits will be in our free cash flow. Including the acquisition and the benefits of Clark, we will have approximately $40 million increase in free cash flow for 2019. Even with lower-than-average net income in Q1 and Q2, this increase is in line with the previous few years. 
For 2019, as we've shared on prior calls, the earnings per share will be flat but we believe the deal will be accretive by $0.005 for the full year 2020. 
Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenues of $524 million was an increase of 9.1% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $480.5 million. There was an accounting change that increased our franchise revenue recognition last year by approximately $1.5 million that did not occur in 2019. 
Income before income taxes improved from Q1 but decreased 3.6% to $87 million from $90.2 million in 2018. Favorable expense adjustments were made but demand still lagged in several areas during the quarter. This impacted all of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 1.9% to $64.3 million; earnings per share was $0.20 per diluted share, in line with $0.20 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018; EBITDA was $109 million, up 2.2% over Q2 2018. EBITDA is the best measure for the near term with the addition of Clark. 
Revenue for the 6 months ended June 30, 2019, showed -- was $953 million, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's second quarter revenues of $889.2 million. 
Income before income taxes decreased 4.3% to $143 million from $149.4 million in 2018. Net income fell 4.9% to $108.5 million, and earnings per share was $0.33, down 5.7% from the 2018 number of $0.35. 
EBITDA was $181.5 million, down 0.7 of 1% compared to 2018. 
I detailed out some of the past and the present, now let's turn our discussion to the future. As first mentioned several quarters ago, we are in the final stages of transitioning our fully funded pension plan off of our books. There's so many positive impacts from this step, which include: Managing the volatility of the assets, the elimination of that: The elimination of the annual $5 million payment to fund the plan; and the elimination of the daily administrative management of the plan. 
In addition, since our plan is approximately 104% funded, which equates to roughly $6 million, these assets will be deployed in other areas of our business that will be discussed on our Q3 earnings call. 
Most of the financial impact from the pension transition will occur in Q3. First, we will have a significant noncash charge of approximately $76 million pretax, which will be pension expense in Q3, which will equate to approximately $0.20 per share after taxes. This $76 million expense is the accounting treatment of the accumulated sum of unrealized losses associated with our plan. Net of tax, the loss will be approximately $64 million. The tax treatment is consistent with the method other companies would apply. The tax effect from the transition of the pension plan will be a reduction in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and for the year. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins' revenue by service line for the second quarter. 
As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 9.1% included 5.5% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 3.6% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 11.1%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 7.7%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 9.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.6%. And from that, residential was up 4.6%; commercial increased 2.8% and termite and ancillary grew 4.6%. 
In total, gross margin was down slightly to 51.7% from 52% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in most expenses due to acquisitions as well as in administrative salaries due to amortization of the employees special restricted share grants from the prior year and increased salaries. Service salaries, materials and supplies and fleet increased with production for the period. Taking out these onetime items, gross margin would have been 51.8%. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $3.8 million to $20.1 million, an increase of 12.9%. Depreciation increased $1.5 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.2 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $18.5 million or 12.9% to $161.9 million or 30.9% of revenues, up 1.1 percentage point from $143.4 million or 29.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2019. 
The increase in the percent of revenues, as I discussed, is primarily due to acquisitions and the amortization of restricted shares from the 2018 special grant distribution and increases in the 401(k) expense. Taking out these onetime items, SG&A would've been 30.3%. 
As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2019, we spent $414.8 million on acquisitions compared to $54.6 million the same period last year. We paid $68.7 million on dividends and had $13.4 million of CapEx, which was up 5.7% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. 
We ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which $67.8 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business August 9, 2019. 
The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

So that's really what put more pressure on the margin than any of these other things."

As you would expect, we're disappointed with our performance for the quarter. We, like most other pest control companies, have both strong and weaker growth periods with some seasonal timing uncertainty. Unfortunately, our situation is not like retail where everyone knows when Christmas comes. Historically, we had handled these weaker periods by adjusting our cost or headcount after the season to the more appropriate levels. 
This year was unique because of the fact that the season was very late. Thankfully, July looks strong, so we have a makeup opportunity. The second quarter revenues rose 9.1% to $524.2 million compared to revenues of $480.5 million in the second quarter of last year. 
Net income declined 3.3% to $63.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $65 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period last year. 
When adjusted for the onetime Clark acquisition expense and the foreign currency exchange, it would be $0.21 per share. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other financial results in a few minutes. 
Revenues for the first 6 months rose 7.2% to $953.2 million compared to $889.2 million for the same period last year. Net income decreased 5.6% to approximately $107.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $114.1 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.35 for the first 6 months of last year. 
We have a number of initiatives that will enhance Rollins' future growth and margin improvement. I'd like to talk more specifically about these business improvements and how they will impact Rollins. As we approach becoming a multibillion-dollar company, the timing is right to make strategic investments that will prepare us for the future. Some of these business investments and innovations are, if you recall, we improved our 401(k) and broadened stock grants at 2018 year-end. We estimate that there's an additional expense of $6 million for 2019 but we believe that there is not a better use of our resources. As a people business, our ability to recruit and retain excellent employees is paramount. 
This investment has helped generate a strong improvement in employee retention for our first 2 quarters. 
Next, we've increased and expanded our investment in customer routing and scheduling. This technology directly benefits our employees and customers. We now guide our technician to the customer's address with a service day that's planned from start to finish. The technicians have better organized days and our customers receive better communication and appointment reliability. 
Our most recent technical innovation in this area is the adoption of Glympse, a software that enables us to communicate with the customer via text or e-mail as to their upcoming service date and time of service. Our customers now even have the ability to see where the technician is when en route to their account. As a result of these tools, we have created a better relationship with our customers and a better job for our technicians. 
The customer is better served and has the capability to change their service date and time as their circumstances dictate. This investment has also contributed to our employees and customers retention improvements and reduction of miles driven. 
As you recall from our earlier calls that we are transitioning our pension to an insurance provider. When complete, this will create a significant administrative expense savings. Eddie will discuss this in more details about this initiative in a few minutes. 
As I mentioned, we've made and are making these improvements and innovations to better prepare for the company's future and to help mitigate some of the challenges we experience due to the seasonality of our business. Expanding our recurring revenue accomplishes this. As you would expect, there's been a significant amount of expenditures and effort that are associated with these initiatives that have and will have a positive effect on the company. 
I would add that our company's track record has shown that we don't have a spend-yourself-rich culture at Rollins and we expect a favorable return on our new and improved programs. With the Clark acquisition complete, we will continue to evaluate other acquisition prospects as adding great companies and brands will remain one of our primary objectives. 
John will now update you on the Clark acquisition and our other plans."
300753,626751588,1777839,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2019",2019-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success we've had an integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years, all of which have contributed in many ways to our profitable growth. Historically",552,"Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success we've had an integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years, all of which have contributed in many ways to our profitable growth. Historically, the larger acquisitions require a bit longer to integrate, as you might expect, and that will apply to Clark as well. 
Once fully incorporated though, the long-term benefits of these acquisitions provide excellent top and bottom line growth expansion of our company and the ability to provide customers with additional pest-control-related services. These acquired companies benefit from our internet experience, greater purchasing power and transferable technology. Clark is on track with our business plan and we expect them to be a highly successful addition to our family of brands. 
Gary and I are heading out there next week where we will meet with their team and check in on their progress. We are excited about Clark as the majority of their branches are in northern California and their addition dramatically strengthens our company's presence in this area. 
As you may recall, we ended 2018 with the best employee retention we've experienced in our recent history, and the first 2 quarters of 2019 continued on that trajectory. 
Further, as you would expect, employee retention directly correlates with customer retention. Improving and enhancing the benefit package for our team members obviously helps retain our people. However, investments in technology and process helps greatly here too as we have slightly -- I'm sorry, as we have simply improved team member job satisfaction with these various tools. A service technician's relationship with their customers is extremely important to ensuring customer loyalty and expanding our customer base. As Gary has shared, our customer routing and scheduling capabilities are a large contributor to improvement in this area as it enables technicians to expand their service time. This enables them to better fulfill their customers' needs and, in some cases, add additional customers to their route. For our field personnel, this technology provides additional benefits in the form of reducing the amount of time spent behind the wheel. 
For the second quarter, we again had nice improvements in driving efficiency as measured by miles per stop. Average miles driven per stop in our Orkin fleet were down 4% year-over-year, and we have had 17 consecutive months of miles per stop reductions. 
One last item related to technology. We gained full implementation of our human resource information system during the first half of the year. And this system, when fully utilized, solves a number of pain points for our field employees. We expect to see continued benefits through 2019 and beyond from these various technology initiatives mentioned. 
On another note, this time of year, we get a lot of questions about how our mosquito business is doing. Although, a relatively small part of our overall business at this point, this service line continues to grow and is in part, driven by increased concern and public awareness around disease-borne issues, including Zika, West Nile and other diseases. Year-over-year, our mosquito service has grown over 35% and we expect continued growth in the future as we gain greater cross-sell penetration of our large pest control customer base. Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials."

I began our Q1 call discussing the strength of April only to have May and June demand look significantly different.

I began our Q1 call discussing the strength of April only to have May and June demand look significantly different. We come to you again sharing what we know at this point with some pent-up demand from previous quarters coming through so far in July. 
Our second quarter results can be defined by looking at the past, the present and the future. Each of these time periods has a significant piece of the results that we're reporting to you today and we'll continue to build on results for quarters and years to come. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included: significant negative currency exchange through a stronger U.S. dollar and our growing international business; continued year-to-date improvements in both employee and customer retention; and uneven pest demand that carry -- that Gary mentioned in the opening. To be more specific, the past events of our investment and enhanced benefits for our employees will impact this quarter by about $1.9 million, $1.5 million for the 401(k) and $400,000 for the special restricted stock and about $1.75 million for the remaining quarters of 2019 as we add Clark to our 401(k) plan. 
While divesting of the special stock grants was a onetime event this year, the 401(k) will be impacted moving forward by employees joining or leaving the plan or increasing or reducing their contribution as we move forward. John just spoke about the lasting outcome that this investment has made on our employee retention, which is a key driver to our long-term success. Again, as a reminder, these items impact both CSP and SG&A, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
In addition to the items that Gary and John mentioned a few minutes ago, our present and future is, and will be, significantly impacted by our acquisition of Clark. We're on pace with our integration and have already made positive changes related to vehicles, procurement and benefits plans. Clark will go live on our fleet systems the 2nd week of August, which will be a step to getting their fleet operating margins more in line with Rollins' levels. 
Based on past acquisitions, we have the opportunity to improve the fleet margins over 20%. Our Rollins support staff have visited with Clark in Lodi, California and we are learning so much. From my recent visit, I had a chance to listen to customer calls, and I was truly impressed with their call center function, the interaction with the customers and its efficiency. When I visited the Stockton branch, I gained a deeper understanding of how they run their operations at such an impressively high level. 
Since that time, several Clark employees have visited Atlanta to learn more about Rollins and how they can support our integration efforts. 
In addition to the reduced fleet expense, other items that will impact the P&L in Q3 and Q4 related to Clark are: depreciation will be up $1.9 million per quarter for buildings and vehicles added. We have received a draft of evaluation of Clark, and including Clark as well as the other 40-plus acquisitions that we've made over the last 18 months, amortization has increased $8.8 million. 
We are in a position to share more details related to the purchase interest expense now that we have worked through some of the specifics. For Q2, we have $1.9 million of interest for the partial quarter of borrowing. For Q3, we estimate $2.7 million as we have already started paying down the loans and have added an interest rate swap to fix a portion of the loan at a rate of roughly 45 bps below LIBOR. We will continue to pay down the loans and estimate a reduction of interest expense to $2.5 million for Q4. 
Again, we've already started to pay off the outstanding loans and our plans are to be debt-free by early 2022. 
Finally, professional services were up $1.9 million for Q2, significantly higher than originally anticipated at the time of our Q1 call due to an in-depth regulatory review, and the need for economic experts to support our case for acquisition as well as expertise related to the real estate transactions. There will be an additional $400,000 of expense related to this in Q3 and we anticipate nothing in Q4. 
For those of you that had a chance to review the release of our 8-K related to the Clark audited 2018 financials, I wanted to share some additional details. 
From the bottom line results that were shared, there are approximately $11 million which will be excluded as we move forward in time: $5.7 million of that is for rents that are no longer paid since we now own the properties; an additional $2.4 million on elimination of vehicles and transportation; and then other expenses in addition. These expenses were normal private company expenses and there was agreement to make these changes prior to the finalizing of the acquisition. 
There will be several margin points of gains from these changes that will be added to additional changes that we add from our integration of the business, previously mentioned. 
One additional item where the Clark deal will have benefits will be in our free cash flow. Including the acquisition and the benefits of Clark, we will have approximately $40 million increase in free cash flow for 2019. Even with lower-than-average net income in Q1 and Q2, this increase is in line with the previous few years. 
For 2019, as we've shared on prior calls, the earnings per share will be flat but we believe the deal will be accretive by $0.005 for the full year 2020. 
Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenues of $524 million was an increase of 9.1% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $480.5 million. There was an accounting change that increased our franchise revenue recognition last year by approximately $1.5 million that did not occur in 2019. 
Income before income taxes improved from Q1 but decreased 3.6% to $87 million from $90.2 million in 2018. Favorable expense adjustments were made but demand still lagged in several areas during the quarter. This impacted all of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 1.9% to $64.3 million; earnings per share was $0.20 per diluted share, in line with $0.20 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018; EBITDA was $109 million, up 2.2% over Q2 2018. EBITDA is the best measure for the near term with the addition of Clark. 
Revenue for the 6 months ended June 30, 2019, showed -- was $953 million, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's second quarter revenues of $889.2 million. 
Income before income taxes decreased 4.3% to $143 million from $149.4 million in 2018. Net income fell 4.9% to $108.5 million, and earnings per share was $0.33, down 5.7% from the 2018 number of $0.35. 
EBITDA was $181.5 million, down 0.7 of 1% compared to 2018. 
I detailed out some of the past and the present, now let's turn our discussion to the future. As first mentioned several quarters ago, we are in the final stages of transitioning our fully funded pension plan off of our books. There's so many positive impacts from this step, which include: managing the volatility of the assets, the elimination of that; the elimination of the annual $5 million payment to fund the plan; and the elimination of the daily administrative management of the plan. 
In addition, since our plan is approximately 104% funded, which equates to roughly $6 million, these assets will be deployed in other areas of our business that will be discussed on our Q3 earnings call. 
Most of the financial impact from the pension transition will occur in Q3. First, we will have a significant noncash charge of approximately $76 million pretax, which will be pension expense in Q3, which will equate to approximately $0.20 per share after taxes. This $76 million expense is the accounting treatment of the accumulated sum of unrealized losses associated with our plan. Net of tax, the loss will be approximately $64 million. The tax treatment is consistent with the method other companies would apply. The tax effect from the transition of the pension plan will be a reduction in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and for the year. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins' revenue by service line for the second quarter. 
As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 9.1% included 5.5% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 3.6% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 11.1%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 7.7%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 9.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.6%. And from that, residential was up 4.6%; commercial increased 2.8%; and termite and ancillary grew 4.6%. 
In total, gross margin was down slightly to 51.7% from 52% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in most expenses due to acquisitions as well as in administrative salaries due to amortization of the employees special restricted share grants from the prior year and increased salaries. Service salaries, materials and supplies and fleet increased with production for the period. Taking out these onetime items, gross margin would have been 51.8%. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $3.8 million to $20.1 million, an increase of 12.9%. Depreciation increased $1.5 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.2 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $18.5 million or 12.9% to $161.9 million or 30.9% of revenues, up 1.1 percentage point from $143.4 million or 29.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2019. 
The increase in the percent of revenues, as I discussed, is primarily due to acquisitions and the amortization of restricted shares from the 2018 special grant distribution and increases in the 401(k) expense. Taking out these onetime items, SG&A would've been 30.3%. 
As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2019, we spent $414.8 million on acquisitions compared to $54.6 million the same period last year. We paid $68.7 million on dividends and had $13.4 million of CapEx, which was up 5.7% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. 
We ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which $67.8 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business August 9, 2019. 
The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

So it wasn't competitive in nature at all. And when we went through and looked at what those impacts were over that time period, it was rounding to 1% for us on the commercial side. So we've made adjustments where we can in the operations with that. But that's something that, historically, we've not seen kind of move like that. So no competitive concerns at this point.

Could you just step back for us and kind of give us the major puts and takes on margin in 2019? And how we should think about the major puts and takes overall, I guess?"

We thought we would be flat to the previous year but with our improved usage of the plan, of more people joining the plan, more people increasing their match in the plan, that has been an additional expense for us. But the other piece of it is going to be staffing for a season that hasn't come as normal or as expected. We don't have a dollar amount for that.

So to me, in an extremely fragmented industry like we have, I think the upside opportunities continue to be out there for years to come. 
And I think when you double down on that with the technology investments that we have made and the fact on how we are executing on those technology investments at this point in time with a lot of runway to go, I still think, personally, that there's a lot of upside potential that has to go with that."

As you would expect, we're disappointed with our performance for the quarter.

As you would expect, we're disappointed with our performance for the quarter. We, like most other pest control companies, have both strong and weaker growth periods with some seasonal timing uncertainty. Unfortunately, our situation is not like retail where everyone knows when Christmas comes. Historically, we had handled these weaker periods by adjusting our cost or head count after the season to the more appropriate levels. 
This year was unique because of the fact that the season was very late. Thankfully, July looks strong, so we have a makeup opportunity. The second quarter revenues rose 9.1% to $524.2 million compared to revenues of $480.5 million in the second quarter of last year. 
Net income declined 3.3% to $63.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $65 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period last year. 
When adjusted for the onetime Clark acquisition expense and the foreign currency exchange, it would be $0.21 per share. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other financial results in a few minutes. 
Revenues for the first 6 months rose 7.2% to $953.2 million compared to $889.2 million for the same period last year. Net income decreased 5.6% to approximately $107.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $114.1 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.35 for the first 6 months of last year. 
We have a number of initiatives that will enhance Rollins' future growth and margin improvement. I'd like to talk more specifically about these business improvements and how they will impact Rollins. As we approach becoming a multibillion-dollar company, the timing is right to make strategic investments that will prepare us for the future. Some of these business investments and innovations are, if you recall, we improved our 401(k) and broadened stock grants at 2018 year-end. We estimate that there's an additional expense of $6 million for 2019 but we believe that there is not a better use of our resources. As a people business, our ability to recruit and retain excellent employees is paramount. 
This investment has helped generate a strong improvement in employee retention for our first 2 quarters. 
Next, we've increased and expanded our investment in customer routing and scheduling. This technology directly benefits our employees and customers. We now guide our technician to the customer's address with a service day that's planned from start to finish. The technicians have better organized days and our customers receive better communication and appointment reliability. 
Our most recent technical innovation in this area is the adoption of Glympse, a software that enables us to communicate with the customer via text or e-mail as to their upcoming service date and time of service. Our customers now even have the ability to see where the technician is when en route to their account. As a result of these tools, we have created a better relationship with our customers and a better job for our technicians. 
The customer is better served and has the capability to change their service date and time as their circumstances dictate. This investment has also contributed to our employees and customers retention improvements and reduction of miles driven. 
As you recall from our earlier calls that we are transitioning our pension to an insurance provider. When complete, this will create a significant administrative expense savings. Eddie will discuss this in more details about this initiative in a few minutes. 
As I mentioned, we've made and are making these improvements and innovations to better prepare for the company's future and to help mitigate some of the challenges we experience due to the seasonality of our business. Expanding our recurring revenue accomplishes this. As you would expect, there's been a significant amount of expenditures and effort that are associated with these initiatives that have and will have a positive effect on the company. 
I would add that our company's track record has shown that we don't have a spend-yourself-rich culture at Rollins and we expect a favorable return on our new and improved programs. With the Clark acquisition complete, we will continue to evaluate other acquisition prospects as adding great companies and brands will remain one of our primary objectives. 
John will now update you on the Clark acquisition and our other plans."
300753,626751588,1781037,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2019",2019-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success we've had an integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years, all of which have contributed in many ways to our profitable growth. Historically",552,"Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success we've had an integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years, all of which have contributed in many ways to our profitable growth. Historically, the larger acquisitions require a bit longer to integrate, as you might expect, and that will apply to Clark as well. 
Once fully incorporated though, the long-term benefits of these acquisitions provide excellent top and bottom line growth expansion of our company and the ability to provide customers with additional pest-control-related services. These acquired companies benefit from our internet experience, greater purchasing power and transferable technology. Clark is on track with our business plan and we expect them to be a highly successful addition to our family of brands. 
Gary and I are heading out there next week where we will meet with their team and check in on their progress. We are excited about Clark as the majority of their branches are in northern California and their addition dramatically strengthens our company's presence in this area. 
As you may recall, we ended 2018 with the best employee retention we've experienced in our recent history, and the first 2 quarters of 2019 continued on that trajectory. 
Further, as you would expect, employee retention directly correlates with customer retention. Improving and enhancing the benefit package for our team members obviously helps retain our people. However, investments in technology and process helps greatly here too as we have slightly -- I'm sorry, as we have simply improved team member job satisfaction with these various tools. A service technician's relationship with their customers is extremely important to ensuring customer loyalty and expanding our customer base. As Gary has shared, our customer routing and scheduling capabilities are a large contributor to improvement in this area as it enables technicians to expand their service time. This enables them to better fulfill their customers' needs and, in some cases, add additional customers to their route. For our field personnel, this technology provides additional benefits in the form of reducing the amount of time spent behind the wheel. 
For the second quarter, we again had nice improvements in driving efficiency as measured by miles per stop. Average miles driven per stop in our Orkin fleet were down 4% year-over-year, and we have had 17 consecutive months of miles per stop reductions. 
One last item related to technology. We gained full implementation of our human resource information system during the first half of the year. And this system, when fully utilized, solves a number of pain points for our field employees. We expect to see continued benefits through 2019 and beyond from these various technology initiatives mentioned. 
On another note, this time of year, we get a lot of questions about how our mosquito business is doing. Although, a relatively small part of our overall business at this point, this service line continues to grow and is in part, driven by increased concern and public awareness around disease-borne issues, including Zika, West Nile and other diseases. Year-over-year, our mosquito service has grown over 35% and we expect continued growth in the future as we gain greater cross-sell penetration of our large pest control customer base. Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials."

I began our Q1 call discussing the strength of April only to have May and June demand look significantly different. We come to you again sharing what we know at this point with some pent-up demand from previous quarters coming through so far in July. 
Our second quarter results can be defined by looking at the past, the present and the future. Each of these time periods has a significant piece of the results that we're reporting to you today and we'll continue to build on results for quarters and years to come. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included: significant negative currency exchange through a stronger U.S. dollar and our growing international business; continued year-to-date improvements in both employee and customer retention; and uneven pest demand that carry -- that Gary mentioned in the opening. To be more specific, the past events of our investment and enhanced benefits for our employees will impact this quarter by about $1.9 million, $1.5 million for the 401(k) and $400,000 for the special restricted stock and about $1.75 million for the remaining quarters of 2019 as we add Clark to our 401(k) plan. 
While divesting of the special stock grants was a onetime event this year, the 401(k) will be impacted moving forward by employees joining or leaving the plan or increasing or reducing their contribution as we move forward. John just spoke about the lasting outcome that this investment has made on our employee retention, which is a key driver to our long-term success. Again, as a reminder, these items impact both CSP and SG&A, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
In addition to the items that Gary and John mentioned a few minutes ago, our present and future is, and will be, significantly impacted by our acquisition of Clark. We're on pace with our integration and have already made positive changes related to vehicles, procurement and benefits plans. Clark will go live on our fleet systems the 2nd week of August, which will be a step to getting their fleet operating margins more in line with Rollins' levels. 
Based on past acquisitions, we have the opportunity to improve the fleet margins over 20%. Our Rollins support staff have visited with Clark in Lodi, California and we are learning so much. From my recent visit, I had a chance to listen to customer calls, and I was truly impressed with their call center function, the interaction with the customers and its efficiency. When I visited the Stockton branch, I gained a deeper understanding of how they run their operations at such an impressively high level. 
Since that time, several Clark employees have visited Atlanta to learn more about Rollins and how they can support our integration efforts. 
In addition to the reduced fleet expense, other items that will impact the P&L in Q3 and Q4 related to Clark are: depreciation will be up $1.9 million per quarter for buildings and vehicles added. We have received a draft of evaluation of Clark, and including Clark as well as the other 40-plus acquisitions that we've made over the last 18 months, amortization has increased $8.8 million. 
We are in a position to share more details related to the purchase interest expense now that we have worked through some of the specifics. For Q2, we have $1.9 million of interest for the partial quarter of borrowing. For Q3, we estimate $2.7 million as we have already started paying down the loans and have added an interest rate swap to fix a portion of the loan at a rate of roughly 45 bps below LIBOR. We will continue to pay down the loans and estimate a reduction of interest expense to $2.5 million for Q4. 
Again, we've already started to pay off the outstanding loans and our plans are to be debt-free by early 2022. 
Finally, professional services were up $1.9 million for Q2, significantly higher than originally anticipated at the time of our Q1 call due to an in-depth regulatory review, and the need for economic experts to support our case for acquisition as well as expertise related to the real estate transactions. There will be an additional $400,000 of expense related to this in Q3 and we anticipate nothing in Q4. 
For those of you that had a chance to review the release of our 8-K related to the Clark audited 2018 financials, I wanted to share some additional details. 
From the bottom line results that were shared, there are approximately $11 million which will be excluded as we move forward in time: $5.7 million of that is for rents that are no longer paid since we now own the properties; an additional $2.4 million on elimination of vehicles and transportation; and then other expenses in addition. These expenses were normal private company expenses and there was agreement to make these changes prior to the finalizing of the acquisition. 
There will be several margin points of gains from these changes that will be added to additional changes that we add from our integration of the business, previously mentioned. 
One additional item where the Clark deal will have benefits will be in our free cash flow. Including the acquisition and the benefits of Clark, we will have approximately $40 million increase in free cash flow for 2019. Even with lower-than-average net income in Q1 and Q2, this increase is in line with the previous few years. 
For 2019, as we've shared on prior calls, the earnings per share will be flat but we believe the deal will be accretive by $0.005 for the full year 2020. 
Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenues of $524 million was an increase of 9.1% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $480.5 million. There was an accounting change that increased our franchise revenue recognition last year by approximately $1.5 million that did not occur in 2019. 
Income before income taxes improved from Q1 but decreased 3.6% to $87 million from $90.2 million in 2018. Favorable expense adjustments were made but demand still lagged in several areas during the quarter. This impacted all of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 1.9% to $64.3 million; earnings per share was $0.20 per diluted share, in line with $0.20 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018; EBITDA was $109 million, up 2.2% over Q2 2018. EBITDA is the best measure for the near term with the addition of Clark. 
Revenue for the 6 months ended June 30, 2019, showed -- was $953 million, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's second quarter revenues of $889.2 million. 
Income before income taxes decreased 4.3% to $143 million from $149.4 million in 2018. Net income fell 4.9% to $108.5 million, and earnings per share was $0.33, down 5.7% from the 2018 number of $0.35. EBITDA was $181.5 million, down 0.7 of 1% compared to 2018. 
I detailed out some of the past and the present, now let's turn our discussion to the future. As first mentioned several quarters ago, we are in the final stages of transitioning our fully funded pension plan off of our books. There's so many positive impacts from this step, which include: managing the volatility of the assets, the elimination of that; the elimination of the annual $5 million payment to fund the plan; and the elimination of the daily administrative management of the plan. 
In addition, since our plan is approximately 104% funded, which equates to roughly $6 million, these assets will be deployed in other areas of our business that will be discussed on our Q3 earnings call. 
Most of the financial impact from the pension transition will occur in Q3. First, we will have a significant noncash charge of approximately $76 million pretax, which will be pension expense in Q3, which will equate to approximately $0.20 per share after taxes. This $76 million expense is the accounting treatment of the accumulated sum of unrealized losses associated with our plan. Net of tax, the loss will be approximately $64 million. The tax treatment is consistent with the method other companies would apply. The tax effect from the transition of the pension plan will be a reduction in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and for the year. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins' revenue by service line for the second quarter. 
As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 9.1% included 5.5% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 3.6% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 11.1%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 7.7%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 9.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.6%. And from that, residential was up 4.6%; commercial increased 2.8%; and termite and ancillary grew 4.6%. 
In total, gross margin was down slightly to 51.7% from 52% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in most expenses due to acquisitions as well as in administrative salaries due to amortization of the employees special restricted share grants from the prior year and increased salaries. Service salaries, materials and supplies and fleet increased with production for the period. Taking out these onetime items, gross margin would have been 51.8%. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $3.8 million to $20.1 million, an increase of 12.9%. Depreciation increased $1.5 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.2 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $18.5 million or 12.9% to $161.9 million or 30.9% of revenues, up 1.1 percentage point from $143.4 million or 29.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2019. 
The increase in the percent of revenues, as I discussed, is primarily due to acquisitions and the amortization of restricted shares from the 2018 special grant distribution and increases in the 401(k) expense. Taking out these onetime items, SG&A would've been 30.3%. 
As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2019, we spent $414.8 million on acquisitions compared to $54.6 million the same period last year. We paid $68.7 million on dividends and had $13.4 million of CapEx, which was up 5.7% from 2018 primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. 
We ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which $67.8 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business August 9, 2019. 
The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

I don't think we've seen anything different having to do with either the price necessarily for that in total. Now there are some channels obviously that are more expensive. But our marketing group I think, again, is doing a great job by going and finding other channels to be able to create some of those leads. And it's just a matter of is there enough demand there for the lead? And I don't think it's necessarily that we're not winning leads.

The warm weather finally appeared nicely, although, later than normal. As a result, we experienced a strong delayed demand for our pest control services. Following a less than satisfactory second quarter, we were diligently to ensure that rightsized our headcount and reduced expenses that weren't essential for the quarter. 
We're proud that our team responded effectively. So also noteworthy that many of our investments and programs continue to generate improved levels of employee retention. 
This [indiscernible] many of our investments and programs continue to generate improved levels of employee retention. This is an important step to improving [indiscernible] we completed the transitioning our fully funded U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. This will provide our company with several accomplishments. We will be eliminating the annual pension contribution, insurance fees, administrative cost, pension management and other related cost to the plan. There will be ongoing cash savings. And employees since freezing of the plan in 2006 have enjoyed significant enhancements to their benefits, most recently to their 401(k) plan. Eddie will provide more detail on the pension discontinuation in his remarks. 
Record revenues for the quarter rose 14.1% to $556.5 million compared to revenues of $487.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Diluted net income of $44.1 million or $0.13 per share was impacted by the noncash pension settlement cost that compares to $66.6 million or $0.20 in 2018. 
Revenues for the first 9 months rose 9.6% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.377 billion for the same period last year. Net income was approximately $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared to $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.56 for the first 9 months of last year. 
Eddie will review the non-GAAP results shortly as they're very meaningful. We experienced strong growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 17.6%, commercial pest control rose 9.2% and termite and ancillary services grew 15.4%. We believe our third quarter results reflect both the resiliency of our company and our team's ability to respond to operational challenges. 
Before turning the call over to John, just a quick update on Clark. John and I visited again wwith the team in California this quarter, and the more time we spent with Clark and their employees, the more excited we are about having them as a member to our family of brands. We're making great strides with our integration as they are now live on our fleet system, fully transition into our 401(k) program and improving their telecom systems.

With the warmer weather experienced during the third quarter, mosquitoes, among other pests, were much more active. Even as the population is becoming more aware of the health threats of mosquitoes, there is still much to be done in this area. Eastern economy [indiscernible] West Nile [indiscernible] and other diseases caused by mosquito bites are becoming a greater health threat. We continue to work with various agencies and organizations in an effort to educate the public about these mosquito risks. In order to meet this public threat, we have worked persistently over the years to add mosquito services in all branch locations. This year, we have grown that service line by more than 30%, and this is helped greatly to propel us to our 6.4% overall organic growth rate for the quarter. 
Additionally, we note that coupling these and other service offerings together for our customers clearly, lengthens our relationship with that customer, increasing the revenue received. 
Now I'd like to share with you some exciting news regarding one of our brands. Northwest Exterminating, last week at the National Pest Management Association meetings, Northwest received the National Pest Management Association gives award. The [indiscernible] gives award recognizes member companies that have demonstrated leadership through dedication and contribution to their community. 
Rollins has increasingly encouraged our brands to give back to their communities and Northwest have certainly led the way in this effort. We are proud of this recognition. I want to congratulate our team and Northwest. In 2006, Northwest introduced their Green Pest Control program, which is a rather unique service offering, targeting common household pests, ants, spiders, roaches, centipedes, millipedes and more, using only high-quality nontoxic products derived from the chemicals, such as flowers, plants and natural elements from their Earth, as well as an IPM and integrated pest management approach, utilizing exclusion techniques to keep pests out in the first place. 
Overtime, this program is expanded to include [indiscernible] offering as well as other green services, such as termite, mosquito and lawn care. Northwest Green programs are continuing to grow with an increasing desire among homeowners for nonchemical treatment in pest control. Overall, these programs are greatly contributing to Northwest impressive growth rate as this point has produced the highest growth of any Rollins brands during the quarter. 
Gary previously noted our strong employee retention, and I'm pleased to be able to say that we have continued improvement in that important metric through the third quarter of this year. We talk about the retention of that in our businesses as we can't stress enough that for a service provider, the impetus to ensuring our employees remain happy and motivated in their jobs is paramount. 
A happy employee translates to a happy customer. 
We have largely focused filtering efforts in 3 ways to gain this improvement. First, we conduct exit surveys to focus on why people leave as well as concerted employee engagement assessment efforts to ensure our teams feels they have a voice in making [indiscernible] And last is the effort to improve the on boarding orientation experience our people undergo. We know if we can just get them past the first year or so, the likelihood of the stay goes up exponentially. Our team members are the face of our brands, and we will continue to invest in training programs, technology and provide opportunities for advancement to ensure they remain with us. Finally, for me, just a quick update on [indiscernible] scheduling. For the third quarter, we again had improvements in driving and efficiency as we Clark 571,000 less miles driven. This improved efficiency comes on the heels of our [ 1.4 million mile ] by a reduction in Q3 last year, and we have now had 19 consecutive months of milage reductions. Now let me turn the call look over to Eddie"

Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and operations, support staff, sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the ongoing business expenses, headwinds of employee benefits, foreign currency exchange and Clark integration items, we made tremendous improvements in all of our financial metrics for the quarter and are positioned well to end the year on a very strong notes. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed exceptional growth and key to the quarter included: finalization of the [indiscernible] pension risk transfer; expansion of our [indiscernible] communication to our residential customer base; and a return to margin growth year-over-year. 
Before we proceed with the review of our financial results, I hope that you had a chance to review our press release from October 3 related to our patient risk transfer. If not, it is posted on our website to view. 
Our overfunded status grew from our original estimate of 104% to nearly 111%. As noted in the press release, we will be using these cash proceeds to fund our company 401(k) match over the next several quarters and pay other plan-related expenses. Once these steps are completed, we will anticipate bringing $6 million to $8 million in cash back to the company for additional deployment. 
The accounting adjustment was also significantly lower than our original estimate, mainly driven by lower interest rates. This accounting pension adjustment flow through our P&L in Q3 and was approximately $50 million before tax. 
As you know, this is a onetime noncash occurrence. As Gary said, I will be discussing our GAAP metrics, and then spending time on our non-GAAP financial metrics that exclude the pension adjustment. For the quarter, we were only calling out the pension adjustment for our non-GAAP results. But a few other items to keep in mind with regards to a net income for the quarter related to our Clark acquisition are: Depreciation of $1.4 million for the quarter for buildings and vehicles added; amortization of intangibles, up $2.9 million per customer contracts; interest expense was $2.8 million related to the borrowing of Clark; professional services about $800,000 as Clark uses a large number of subcontractors, and this is a higher percentage of revenue than in our other Rollins brand. These categories equate to $7.9 million and is based subsided or lapped will continue to improve our year-over-year margin expansion moving forward. 
As we look through our numbers, I will give you GAAP numbers that include our patient accounting adjustment and then transition to our non-GAAP numbers that reflect our true operating results, again, only with the patient loss to eliminate. So with the pension, looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenue was $556.5 million. That was an increase of 14.1% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $487.7 million. 
Again, with the pension adjustment included, income before income taxes was $46.1 million or 48.7% below 2018. 
Net income was $44.1 million, down 33.9% compared to 2018. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax rose 6.8% to $96 million compared to $89.9 million in 2018. 
We had a slightly higher tax rate this quarter at 26.5% but feel that our full year rate will be in the low 20s with our Q3 pension entry. Our net income rose 6% to $70.6 million and EPS were $0.22 per diluted share, up from $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018, a 10% increase. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, our best financial measure at this time is EBITDA, which was $120.6 million compared to $106.7 million in 2018, a 13% increase. We have only had one other quarter outside of the quarter with a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that includes this growth since 2014. 
With the pension, revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, was [$1.509  ] billion an increase of 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.377 billion. 
Income before income taxes decreased 20.9% to $189.2 million [ of $239.3 ] million in 2018. Net income fell 15.6% to $152.6 million and earnings per share were $0.47, down 14.5% for the 2018 number of $0.55. EBITDA was $252.1 million, down 12.9% compared to 2018. 
Without the pension adjustment, income before income taxes decreased 0.1% to $239 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 0.1% to $179.2 million and earnings per share were $0.55 flat to the previous year. EBITDA was $302 million, up 4.3% compared to 2018. 
Our technology roadmap continues to pay healthy dividends with regards to operational efficiency improvements and an improved customer experience. 
John mentioned the improvements in miles driven for the quarter as we continue to see improvements year-over-year since the inception of our routing and scheduling initiatives, which started in 2016. 
These reductions increased the time our technicians can spend with the customers and increases the technicians capacity. 
As of September, we have added over 70% of our Orkin residential routes to [indiscernible] Each customer on these routes as of the saving of multiple proactive text or e-mail notifications the technician, beginning days in advance and culminating when they're on their way to the customer. This technology is the best in the industry and are early results show improved customer retention for each of our mature branches that are providing this enhanced customer communication. 
We anticipate these results to continue to improve our customer retention and margin for quarters and years to come, much like we have seen from our routing and scheduling results. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins' revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase was 14.1% and included 7.7% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 6.4% was from pricing and organic growth. 
This is the strongest organic growth rate in a quarter since 2013. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 17.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 17% of our revenue, was up 15.4%. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 6.4%.; from that, residential was up 8%; commercial increased 3.5%; and termite and ancillary grew 7.9%. This was the largest commercial increase in over a year. 
The revenue strength this quarter is a combination of the late season that did not materialize in Q1 or Q2, execution by our operations and a great job by our sales force. One of Gary's famous quotes is ""the season always comes up. At some point, it does get warm and pest do come out and the season does start."" In most years, that strength is seen in May and June and impacts Q2. 
As you know, that did not occur this year but our year-to-date revenue growth, ex currency and M&A, is moving in our direction to be in line or higher than the past 3 years. The key is that demand does not evaporate. 
When it gets warm, the bugs comings out. This year that did not happen until July, but it did in a really big way. 
In total, gross margin improved to 51.7% from 51.6% from prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories such as service salaries, sales salaries, personnel-related and professional services, all related to the acquisition of Clark. 
These increases were offset by reductions in administrative salaries due to improved efficiency and reduction of materials and supply. 
The additional [indiscernible] items that I just mentioned, impacted the margin by almost a full percentage point. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.8 million to $21.7 million, an increase of 28.6%. 
Depreciation increased $1.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.1 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, General and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $22.1 million or 15.2% to $167.2 million or 30% of revenues, up $0.03 of a percentage point from $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2018. 
The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased sales competition, composition, enhanced 401(k) plan expense, maintenance and IT contract expense. 
As for our cash position for the period ended September 30, 2019, we spent $431.2 million on acquisitions compared to $71.8 million for the same period last year, which, of course, included Clark. We paid $103.1 million on dividends and had $18.7 million of CapEx, which was up 4.8% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. We ended the period with $104.4 million in cash, of which $71 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on December 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 11, 2019. In addition, the Board declared a special dividend of $0.05, also payable when the regular dividend is paid. 
For the regular cash dividend, this is the 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% and the 7th year in a row the port has declared a special dividend. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you"

But we've talked about on previous calls that we have our internal credits department that enabled us to really be able to help in the closing tool for that. So it was a great quality service, termite perspective. And we also have that ability for customers to be able to use our internal credit department.

There's lots of different groups that companies that have their own margin pressure and that can be pushed along to all of their vendors.

Well, first and foremost, we're pleased with our third quarter execution and results across all of our business service lines. The warm weather finally appeared thankfully, although, later than normal. As a result, we experienced a strong delayed demand for our pest control services. Following a less than satisfactory second quarter, we work diligently to ensure that we rightsized our headcount and reduced expenses that weren't essential for the quarter. 
We're proud that our team responded effectively. It's also noteworthy that many of our investments and programs continue to generate improved levels of employee retention. 
This is an important step to improving 
[Audio Gap] 
completed the transition of our fully funded U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. This will provide our company with several accomplishments. We will be eliminating the annual pension contribution, insurance fees, administrative cost, pension management and other related cost of the plan. There will be ongoing cash savings. Our employees, since freezing of the plan in 2006, have enjoyed significant enhancements to their benefits, most recently to their 401(k) plan. Eddie will provide more detail on the pension discontinuation in his remarks. 
Record revenues for the quarter rose 14.1% to $556.5 million compared to revenues of $487.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Diluted net income of $44.1 million or $0.13 per share was impacted by the noncash pension settlement cost that compares to $66.6 million or $0.20 in 2018. 
Revenues for the first 9 months rose 9.6% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.377 billion for the same period last year. Net income was approximately $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared to $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.56 for the first 9 months of last year. 
Eddie will review the non-GAAP results shortly as they're very meaningful. We experienced strong growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 17.6%, commercial pest control rose 9.2% and termite and ancillary services grew 15.4%.

With the warmer weather experienced during the third quarter, mosquitoes, among other pests, were much more active. Even as the population is becoming more aware of the health threats of mosquitoes, there is still much to be done in this area. Eastern Equine Encephalitis, West Nile, Zika and other diseases caused by mosquito bites are becoming a greater health threat. We continue to work with various agencies and organizations in an effort to educate the public about these mosquito risks. In order to meet this public threat, we have worked persistently over the years to add mosquito services in all branch locations. This year, we have grown that service line by more than 30%, and this has helped greatly to propel us to our 6.4% overall organic growth rate for the quarter. 
Additionally, we know that coupling these and other service offerings together for our customers clearly lengthens our relationship with that customer, increasing the revenue received. 
Now I'd like to share with you some exciting news regarding one of our brands. Northwest Exterminating, last week at the National Pest Management Association meetings, Northwest received the National Pest Management Association Gives Award. The NPMA Gives Award recognizes member companies that have demonstrated leadership through dedication and contribution to their community. 
Rollins has increasingly encouraged our brands to give back to their communities and Northwest has certainly led the way in this effort. We are proud of this recognition and want to congratulate our team at Northwest. In 2006, Northwest introduced their Green Pest Control program, which is a rather unique service offering, targeting common household pests, ants, spiders, roaches, mice, centipedes, millipedes and more, using only high-quality nontoxic products derived from botanicals, such as flowers, plants and natural elements from the earth, as well as an IPM or integrated pest management approach, utilizing exclusion techniques to keep pests out in the first place.  
Overtime, this program has expanded to include a Green Elite offering as well as other Green services, such as termite, mosquito and lawn care. Northwest Green programs are continuing to grow with an increasing desire among homeowners for nonchemical treatment in pest control. Overall, these programs are greatly contributing to Northwest's impressive growth rate as this brand has produced the highest growth of any Rollins' brands during the quarter. 
Gary previously noted our strong employer retention, and I'm pleased to be able to say that we have continued our improvement in that important metric through the third quarter of this year. We talk about retention a lot in our businesses as we can't stress enough that for a service provider, the importance to ensuring our employees remain happy and motivated in their jobs is paramount. 
A happy employee translates to a happy customer. 
We have largely focused our field team efforts in 3 ways to gain this improvement. First, we conduct exit surveys to focus on why people leave as well as concerted employee engagement assessment efforts to ensure our teams feels they have a voice in making things [indiscernible] and last is the effort to improve the onboarding and orientation experience our people undergo. We know if we can just get them past the first year or so, the likelihood to stay goes up exponentially. Our team members are the face of our brands, and we will continue to invest in training programs, technology and provide opportunities for advancement to ensure they remain with us. Finally, for me, just a quick update on routing and scheduling. For the third quarter, we again, had improvements in driving and route efficiency as we clock 571,000 less miles driven. This improved efficiency comes on the heels of a 1.4 million mile reduction in Q3 last year, and we have now had 19 consecutive months of milage reductions. Now let me turn the call look over to Eddie."

Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the",1591,"Thanks, John. Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the ongoing business expenses, headwinds of employee benefits, foreign currency exchange and Clark integration items, we made tremendous improvements in all of our financial metrics for the quarter and are positioned well to end the year on a very strong note. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed exceptional growth and key to the quarter included: finalization of the Rollins' pension risk transfer; expansion of our Glympse communication to our residential customer base; and a return to margin growth year-over-year. 
Before we proceed with the review of our financial results, I hope that you've had a chance to review our press release from October 3 related to our pension risk transfer. If not, it is posted on our website to view. 
Our overfunded status grew from our original estimate of 104% to nearly 111%. As noted in the press release, we will be using these cash proceeds to fund our company 401(k) match over the next several quarters and pay other plan-related expenses. Once these steps are completed, we will anticipate bringing $6 million to $8 million in cash back to the company for additional deployment. 
The accounting adjustment was also significantly lower than our original estimate, mainly driven by lower interest rates. This accounting pension adjustment flow through our P&L in Q3 and was approximately $50 million before tax. 
As you know, this is a onetime noncash occurrence. As Gary said, I will be discussing our GAAP metrics, and then spending time on our non-GAAP financial metrics that exclude the pension adjustment. For the quarter, we are only calling out the pension adjustment for our non-GAAP results. But a few other items to keep in mind with regards to our net income for the quarter related to our Clark acquisition are: depreciation of $1.4 million for the quarter for buildings and vehicles added; amortization of intangibles, up $2.9 million per customer contracts; interest expense was $2.8 million related to the borrowing of Clark; professional services about $800,000 as Clark uses a large number of subcontractors, and this is a higher percentage of revenue than our -- than in our other Rollins' brand. These categories equate to $7.9 million and as they subside or lapped will continue to improve our year-over-year margin expansion moving forward. 
As we look through our numbers, I will give you GAAP numbers that include our pension accounting adjustment and then transition to our non-GAAP numbers that reflect our true operating results, again, only with the pension loss eliminated. So with the pension, looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenue was $556.5 million. That was an increase of 14.1% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $487.7 million. 
Again, with the pension adjustment included, income before income taxes was $46.1 million or 48.7% below 2018. 
Net income was $44.1 million, down 33.9% compared to 2018. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax rose 6.8% to $96 million compared to $89.9 million in 2018. 
We had a slightly higher tax rate this quarter at 26.5%, but feel that our full year rate will be in the low 20s with our Q3 pension entry. Our net income rose 6% to $70.6 million and EPS were $0.22 per diluted share, up from $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018, a 10% increase. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, our best financial measure at this time is EBITDA, which was $120.6 million compared to $106.7 million in 2018, a 13% increase. We have only had one other quarter outside of the quarter with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that eclipsed this growth since 2014.  
With the pension, revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, was $1.509 billion, an increase of 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.377 billion. 
Income before income taxes decreased 20.9% to $189.2 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 15.6% to $152.6 million and earnings per share were $0.47, down 14.5% for the 2018 number of $0.55. EBITDA was $252.1 million, down 12.9% compared to 2018. 
Without the pension adjustment, income before income tax decreased 0.1% to $239 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 0.1% to $179.2 million and earnings per share were $0.55 flat to the previous year. EBITDA was $302 million, up 4.3% compared to 2018. 
Our technology roadmap continues to pay healthy dividends with regards to operational efficiency improvements and an improved customer experience. 
John mentioned the improvements in miles driven for the quarter as we continue to see improvements year-over-year since the inception of our routing and scheduling initiative, which started in 2016. 
These reductions increased the time our technicians can spend with the customers and increases the technician's capacity. 
As of September, we have added over 70% of our Orkin residential routes to Glympse. Each customer on these routes is receiving multiple proactive text or e-mail notifications from the technician, beginning days in advance and culminating when they're on their way to the customer. This technology is the best in the industry and our early results show improved customer retention for each of our mature branches that are providing this enhanced customer communication. 
We anticipate these results to continue to improve our customer retention and margin for quarters and years to come, much like we have seen from our routing and scheduling results. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins' revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase was 14.1% and included 7.7% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 6.4% was from pricing and organic growth. 
This is the strongest organic growth rate in a quarter since 2013. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 17.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 17% of our revenue, was up 15.4%. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 6.4%. From that, residential was up 8%; commercial increased 3.5%; and termite and ancillary grew 7.9%. This was the largest commercial increase in over a year. 
The revenue strength this quarter is a combination of the late season that did not materialize in Q1 or Q2, execution by our operations and a great job by our sales force. One of Gary's famous quotes is, ""The season always comes. At some point, it does get warm and the pests do come out and the season does start."" In most years, that strength is seen in May and June and impacts Q2. 
As you know, that did not occur this year, but our year-to-date revenue growth, ex currency and M&A, is moving in a direction to be in line or higher than the past 3 years. The key is that demand does not evaporate. 
When it gets warm, the bugs come out. This year, that did not happen until July, but it did in a really big way. 
In total, gross margin improved 51 -- to 51.7% from 51.6%, prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories such as service salaries, sales salaries, personnel-related and professional services, all related to the acquisition of Clark. 
These increases were offset by reductions in administrative salaries due to improved efficiency and reduction in materials and supplies. 
The additional Clark items that I just mentioned, impacted the margin by almost a full percentage point. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.8 million to $21.7 million, an increase of 28.6%. 
Depreciation increased $1.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.1 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $22.1 million or 15.2% to $167.2 million or 30% of revenues, up 0.3 percentage point from $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2018. 
The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased sales competition, compensation, enhanced 401(k) plan expense, maintenance and IT contract expense. 
As for our cash position for the period ended September 30, 2019, we spent $431.2 million on acquisitions compared to $71.8 million for the same period last year, which, of course, included Clark. We paid $103.1 million on dividends and had $18.7 million of CapEx, which was up 4.8% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. We ended the period with $104.4 million in cash, of which $71 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on December 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 11, 2019. In addition, the Board declared a special dividend of $0.05, also payable when the regular dividend is paid. 
For the regular cash dividend, this is the 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% and the seventh year in a row the Board has declared a special dividend. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

We have a QA group that will look on the backside to make sure that a good quality service is being done. And they'll also help to manage any claims related issues or concerns that might be out there to be able to help to minimize that in any way possible. We also take a look carefully at the contracts that we offer that are available out there, kind of based on the different type of termite and the different areas of the country to make sure that we feel like it's the right risk to be able to take in the different areas."

Just like we do the bigger ones, the -- they can provide a tremendous opportunity to tuck in to a location and really improve that -- the densities, the route density of that branch and that business. And so that's usually the approach we'll take with those. But from an employee perspective, we take the same approach as we do from -- with the bigger ones because as I like to say, our team -- in our business, when you buy a company, you don't buy a lot of hard assets, all you get are employees and customers and neither has to stay. And so if we don't treat the employee well and onboard them well and integrate them well, then that customer won't be there at the end of the day either.

So we really shifted our focus probably over the last 18 months from a new customer perspective, really looking at those areas. There's lots of different groups that -- companies that have their own margin pressure, and that can be pushed along to all of their vendors. And we're continuing to move away from those and continue to concentrated areas where there's less price sensitivity, and they care more about the quality and they're willing to pay for the quality or the service.

So I think if you go through and you -- if you wanted to look at it from that perspective, you go through and kind of strip those things out, I think you'll see a nice improvement year-over-year for the quarter.

Well, first and foremost, we're pleased with our third quarter execution and results across all of our business service lines. The warm weather finally appeared thankfully, although later than normal. As a result, we experienced a strong delayed demand for our pest control services. Following a less than satisfactory second quarter, we worked diligently to ensure that we rightsized our head count and reduced expenses that weren't essential for the quarter. We're proud that our team responded effectively. 
It's also noteworthy that many of our investments and programs continued to generate improved levels of employee retention. 
This is an important step to improving customer service in the field and in administration. 
In addition earlier this month, we completed the transition of our fully funded U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. This will provide our company with several accomplishments. We will be eliminating the annual pension contribution, insurance fees, administrative cost, pension management and other related cost of the plan. There will be ongoing cash savings. Our employees, since freezing of the plan in 2006, have enjoyed significant enhancements to their benefits, most recently to their 401(k) plan. Eddie will provide more detail on the pension discontinuation in his remarks. 
Record revenues for the quarter rose 14.1% to $556.5 million compared to revenues of $487.7 million in the third quarter of last year.
Diluted net income of $44.1 million or $0.13 per share was impacted by the noncash pension settlement cost that compares to $66.6 million or $0.20 in 2018. 
Revenues for the first 9 months rose 9.6% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.377 billion for the same period last year. 
Net income was approximately $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared to $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.56 for (sic) [ $0.55] the first 9 months of last year. Eddie will review the non-GAAP results shortly as they're very meaningful. 
We experienced strong growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 17.6%, commercial pest control rose 9.2% and termite and ancillary services grew 15.4%. We believe our third quarter results reflect both the resiliency of our company and our team's ability to respond to operational challenges. 
Before turning the call over to John, just a quick update on Clark. John and I visited again with the team in California this quarter, and the more time we spend with Clark and their employees, the more excited we are about having them as a member to our family of brands. We're making great strides with our integration as they are now live on our fleet system, fully transitioned into our 401(k) program and improving their telecom systems. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John?"

With the warmer weather experienced during the third quarter, mosquitoes, among other pests, were much more active.

With the warmer weather experienced during the third quarter, mosquitoes, among other pests, were much more active. Even as the population is becoming more aware of the health threats of mosquitoes, there is still much to be done in this area. Eastern Equine Encephalitis, West Nile, Zika and other diseases caused by mosquito bites are becoming a greater health threat. 
We continue to work with various agencies and organizations in an effort to educate the public about these mosquito risks. In order to meet this public threat, we have worked persistently over the years to add mosquito services in all branch locations. This year, we have grown that service line by more than 30%, and this has helped greatly to propel us to our 6.4% overall organic growth rate for the quarter. 
Additionally, we know that coupling these and other service offerings together for our customers, clearly lengthens our relationship with that customer, increasing the revenue received. 
Now I'd like to share with you some exciting news regarding one of our brands. Northwest Exterminating, last week at the National Pest Management Association meetings, Northwest received the National Pest Management Association Gives Award. The NPMA Gives Award recognizes member companies that have demonstrated leadership through dedication and contribution to their community. 
Rollins has increasingly encouraged our brands to give back to their communities and Northwest has certainly led the way in this effort. We are proud of this recognition and want to congratulate our team at Northwest. 
In 2006, Northwest introduced their Green Pest Control program, which is a rather unique service offering, targeting common household pests, ants, spiders, roaches, mice, centipedes, millipedes and more, using only high-quality nontoxic products derived from botanicals, such as flowers, plants and natural elements from the earth, as well as an IPM or integrated pest management approach, utilizing exclusion techniques to keep pests out in the first place. 
Over time, this program has expanded to include a Green Elite offering as well as other Green services, such as termite, mosquito and lawn care. Northwest Green programs are continuing to grow with an increasing desire among homeowners for nonchemical treatment in pest control. Overall, these programs are greatly contributing to Northwest's impressive growth rate as this brand has produced the highest growth of any Rollins' brands during the quarter. 
Gary previously noted our strong employer retention, and I'm pleased to be able to say that we have continued our improvement in that important metric through the third quarter of this year. We talk about retention a lot in our businesses as we can't stress enough that for a service provider, the importance to ensuring our employees remain happy and motivated in their jobs is paramount. 
A happy employee translates to a happy customer. 
We have largely focused our field team efforts in 3 ways to gain this improvement. First, we conduct exit surveys to focus on why people leave as well as concerted employee engagement assessment efforts to ensure our teams feels they have a voice in making things better. 
And last is the effort to improve the onboarding and orientation experience our people undergo. We know if we can just get them past the first year or so, the likelihood to stay goes up exponentially. Our team members are the face of our brands, and we will continue to invest in training programs, technology and provide opportunities for advancement to ensure they remain with us. 
Finally, for me, just a quick update on routing and scheduling. For the third quarter, we again, had improvements in driving and route efficiency as we clocked 571,000 less miles driven. This improved efficiency comes on the heels of a 1.4 million mile reduction in Q3 last year, and we have now had 19 consecutive months of mileage reductions. 
Now let me turn the call look over to Eddie."
300753,639074841,1840478,"Rollins, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the",1592,"Thanks, John. Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the ongoing business expenses, headwinds of employee benefits, foreign currency exchange and Clark integration items, we made tremendous improvements in all of our financial metrics for the quarter and are positioned well to end the year on a very strong note. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed exceptional growth and key to the quarter included: finalization of the Rollins' pension risk transfer; expansion of our Glympse communication to our residential customer base; and a return to margin growth year-over-year. 
Before we proceed with the review of our financial results, I hope that you've had a chance to review our press release from October 3 related to our pension risk transfer. If not, it is posted on our website to view. 
Our overfunded status grew from our original estimate of 104% to nearly 111%. As noted in the press release, we will be using these cash proceeds to fund our company 401(k) match over the next several quarters and pay other plan-related expenses. Once these steps are completed, we will anticipate bringing $6 million to $8 million in cash back to the company for additional deployment. 
The accounting adjustment was also significantly lower than our original estimate, mainly driven by lower interest rates. This accounting pension adjustment flowed through our P&L in Q3 and was approximately $50 million before tax. 
As you know, this is a onetime noncash occurrence. As Gary said, I will be discussing our GAAP metrics, and then spending time on our non-GAAP financial metrics that exclude the pension adjustment. 
For the quarter, we are only calling out the pension adjustment for our non-GAAP results. But a few other items to keep in mind with regards to our net income for the quarter related to our Clark acquisition are: depreciation of $1.4 million for the quarter for buildings and vehicles added; amortization of intangibles, up $2.9 million for customer contracts; interest expense was $2.8 million related to the borrowing of Clark; professional services up $800,000 as Clark uses a large number of subcontractors, and this is a higher percentage of revenue than our -- than in our other Rollins' brands. These categories equate to $7.9 million and as they subside or lapped will continue to improve our year-over-year margin expansion moving forward. 
As we look through our numbers, I will give you GAAP numbers that include our pension accounting adjustment and then transition to our non-GAAP numbers that reflect our true operating results, again, only with the pension loss eliminated. 
So with the pension, looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenue was $556.5 million. That was an increase of 14.1% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $487.7 million. 
Again, with the pension adjustment included, income before income taxes was $46.1 million or 48.7% below 2018. 
Net income was $44.1 million, down 33.9% compared to 2018. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. 
Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax rose 6.8% to $96 million compared to $89.9 million in 2018. 
We had a slightly higher tax rate this quarter at 26.4%, but feel that our full year rate will be in the low 20s with our Q3 pension entry. Our net income rose 6% to $70.6 million and EPS were $0.22 per diluted share, up from $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018, a 10% increase. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, our best financial measure at this time is EBITDA, which was $120.6 million compared to $106.7 million in 2018, a 13% increase. We have only had one other quarter outside of the quarter with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that eclipsed this growth since 2014. 
With the pension, revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, was $1.509 billion, an increase of 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.377 billion. 
Income before income taxes decreased 20.9% to $189.2 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 15.6% to $152.6 million and earnings per share were $0.47, down 14.5% for the 2018 number of $0.55. EBITDA was $252.1 million, down 12.9% compared to 2018. 
Without the pension adjustment, income before income tax decreased 0.01% to $239 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 0.01% to $179.2 million and earnings per share were $0.55 flat to the previous year. EBITDA was $302 million, up 4.3% compared to 2018. 
Our technology road map continues to pay healthy dividends with regards to operational efficiency improvements and an improved customer experience. 
John mentioned the improvements in miles driven for the quarter as we continue to see improvements year-over-year since the inception of our routing and scheduling initiatives, which started in 2016. 
These reductions increased the time our technicians can spend with the customers and increases the technician's capacity. 
As of September, we have added over 70% of our Orkin residential routes to Glympse. Each customer on these routes is receiving multiple proactive text or e-mail notifications from the technician, beginning days in advance and culminating when they're on their way to the customer. This technology is the best in the industry and our early results show improved customer retention for each of our mature branches that are providing this enhanced customer communication. 
We anticipate these results to continue to improve our customer retention and margin for quarters and years to come, much like we have seen from our routing and scheduling results. 
Let's take a look to the Rollins' revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase was 14.1% and included 7.7% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 6.4% was from pricing and organic growth. 
This is the strongest organic growth rate in a quarter since 2013. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 17.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 17% of our revenue, was up 15.4%. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 6.4%. From that, residential was up 8%; commercial increased 3.5%; and termite and ancillary grew 7.9%. This was the largest commercial increase in over a year. 
The revenue strength this quarter is a combination of the late season that did not materialize in Q1 or Q2, execution by our operations and a great job by our sales force. One of Gary's famous quotes is, ""The season always comes."" At some point, it does get warm and the pests do come out and the season does start. In most years, that strength is seen in May and June and impacts Q2. 
As you know, that did not occur this year, but our year-to-date revenue growth, ex currency and M&A, is moving in a direction to be in line or higher than the past 3 years. The key is that demand does not evaporate. When it gets warm, the bugs come out. This year, that did not happen until July, but it did in a really big way. 
In total, gross margin improved 51 -- to 51.7% from 51.6%, prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories such as service salaries, sales salaries, personnel-related and professional services, all related to the acquisition of Clark. 
These increases were offset by reductions in administrative salaries due to improved efficiency and reduction in materials and supplies. 
The additional Clark items that I've just mentioned, impacted the margin by almost a full percentage point. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.8 million to $21.7 million, an increase of 28.6%. 
Depreciation increased $1.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.1 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $22.1 million or 15.2% to $167.2 million or 30% of revenues, up 0.3 percentage points from $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2018. 
The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased sales competition, compensation, enhanced 401(k) plan expense, maintenance and IT contract expense. 
As for our cash position for the period ended September 30, 2019, we spent $431.2 million on acquisitions compared to $71.8 million for the same period last year, which, of course, included Clark. We paid $103.1 million on dividends and had $18.7 million of CapEx, which was up 4.8% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. We ended the period with $104.4 million in cash, of which $71 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on December 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 11, 2019. In addition, the Board declared a special dividend of $0.05, also payable when the regular dividend is paid. 
For the regular cash dividend, this is the 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% and the seventh year in a row the Board has declared a special dividend. 
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

And they'll also help to manage any claims related issues or concerns that might be out there to be able to help to minimize that in any way possible.

Jamie, no doubt, the market is frothy from that perspective in terms of the opportunity to buy these companies. And with the multiples being paid, certainly many of the smaller companies are out there and actively shopping and trying to sell their companies as well. 
We certainly go after the small ones. Just like we do the bigger ones, the -- they can provide a tremendous opportunity to tuck in to a location and really improve that -- the density -- the route density of that branch and that business. And so that's usually the approach we'll take with those. 
But from an employee perspective, we take the same approach as we do from -- with the bigger ones because as I like to say, our team -- in our business, when you buy a company, you don't buy a lot of hard assets, all you get are employees and customers and neither has to stay. And so if we don't treat the employee well and onboard them well and integrate them well, then that customer won't be there at the end of the day either. And so that's really our approach, whether it's big or small."

We know that there are other players that if you look back 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, they may not have been in the market. We're still seeing very rational pricing that is out there in most cases that are available. 
We've really concentrated on areas where we know that there's less price sensitivity. So we've really shifted our focus probably over the last 18 months from a new customer perspective, really looking at those areas. There's lots of different groups that -- companies that have their own margin pressure, and that can be pushed along to all of their vendors. And we're continuing to move away from those and continue to concentrated areas where there's less price sensitivity, and they care more about the quality and they're willing to pay for the quality of the service. 
So we're seeing some more retention from that because the quality of service that we're able to attain, and I think that's helping us to be able to continue to incrementally improve and in this case, have a pretty healthy jump as far as the commercial is concerned."

We've talked about pent-up demand. Gary talks regularly about looking at a full year as far as revenue growth because there is going to be fluctuation that's going to occur between the different quarters. Of course, this year was tremendously different than anything that we've seen in previous years, and I think Gary probably would say the same thing, in his time period it was completely different. 
But there was significant pent-up demand, but I would also say that we had great marketing initiatives and our operations executed extremely well to be able to have a higher retention rate from a customer perspective, which I think will help us from an organic revenue perspective as we're moving forward in time. 
So I think the combination of those things helped with the record that we saw this quarter, and I think are going to help us as we move forward. The technology that we put in place with Glympse, and John talked about our routing and scheduling, is making it a better job for our technician and it's making it a better customer experience from a customer's perspective.

Well, first and foremost, we're pleased with our third quarter execution and results across all of our business service lines. The warm weather finally appeared thankfully, although later than normal. As a result, we experienced a strong delayed demand for our pest control services. Following a less than satisfactory second quarter, we worked diligently to ensure that we rightsized our head count and reduced expenses that weren't essential for the quarter. We're proud that our team responded effectively. 
It's also noteworthy that many of our investments and programs continued to generate improved levels of employee retention. 
This is an important step to improving customer service in the field and in administration. 
In addition earlier this month, we completed the transition of our fully funded U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. This will provide our company with several accomplishments. We will be eliminating the annual pension contribution, insurance fees, administrative cost, pension management and other related cost of the plan. There will be ongoing cash savings. Our employees, since freezing of the plan in 2006, have enjoyed significant enhancements to their benefits, most recently to their 401(k) plan. Eddie will provide more detail on the pension discontinuation in his remarks. 
Record revenues for the quarter rose 14.1% to $556.5 million compared to revenues of $487.7 million in the third quarter of last year.
Diluted net income of $44.1 million or $0.13 per share was impacted by the noncash pension settlement cost that compares to $66.6 million or $0.20 in 2018. 
Revenues for the first 9 months rose 9.6% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.377 billion for the same period last year. 
Net income was approximately $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared to $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.56 for (sic) [ $0.55] the first 9 months of last year. Eddie will review the non-GAAP results shortly as they're very meaningful. 
We experienced strong growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 17.6%, commercial pest control rose 9.2% and termite and ancillary services grew 15.4%. We believe our third quarter results reflect both the resiliency of our company and our team's ability to respond to operational challenges. 
Before turning the call over to John, just a quick update on Clark. John and I visited again with the team in California this quarter, and the more time we spend with Clark and their employees, the more excited we are about having them as a member to our family of brands. We're making great strides with our integration as they are now live on our fleet system, fully transitioned into our 401(k) program and improving their telecom systems. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John?"

With the warmer weather experienced during the third quarter, mosquitoes, among other pests, were much more active. Even as the population is becoming more aware of the health threats of mosquitoes, there is still much to be done in this area. Eastern Equine Encephalitis, West Nile, Zika and other diseases caused by mosquito bites are becoming a greater health threat. 
We continue to work with various agencies and organizations in an effort to educate the public about these mosquito risks. In order to meet this public threat, we have worked persistently over the years to add mosquito services in all branch locations. This year, we have grown that service line by more than 30%, and this has helped greatly to propel us to our 6.4% overall organic growth rate for the quarter. 
Additionally, we know that coupling these and other service offerings together for our customers, clearly lengthens our relationship with that customer, increasing the revenue received. 
Now I'd like to share with you some exciting news regarding one of our brands. Northwest Exterminating, last week at the National Pest Management Association meetings, Northwest received the National Pest Management Association Gives Award. The NPMA Gives Award recognizes member companies that have demonstrated leadership through dedication and contribution to their community. 
Rollins has increasingly encouraged our brands to give back to their communities and Northwest has certainly led the way in this effort. We are proud of this recognition and want to congratulate our team at Northwest. 
In 2006, Northwest introduced their Green Pest Control program, which is a rather unique service offering, targeting common household pests, ants, spiders, roaches, mice, centipedes, millipedes and more, using only high-quality nontoxic products derived from botanicals, such as flowers, plants and natural elements from the earth, as well as an IPM or integrated pest management approach, utilizing exclusion techniques to keep pests out in the first place. 
Over time, this program has expanded to include a Green Elite offering as well as other Green services, such as termite, mosquito and lawn care. Northwest Green programs are continuing to grow with an increasing desire among homeowners for nonchemical treatment in pest control. Overall, these programs are greatly contributing to Northwest's impressive growth rate as this brand has produced the highest growth of any Rollins' brands during the quarter. 
Gary previously noted our strong employer retention, and I'm pleased to be able to say that we have continued our improvement in that important metric through the third quarter of this year. We talk about retention a lot in our businesses as we can't stress enough that for a service provider, the importance to ensuring our employees remain happy and motivated in their jobs is paramount. 
A happy employee translates to a happy customer. 
We have largely focused our field team efforts in 3 ways to gain this improvement. First, we conduct exit surveys to focus on why people leave as well as concerted employee engagement assessment efforts to ensure our teams feels they have a voice in making things better. 
And last is the effort to improve the onboarding and orientation experience our people undergo. We know if we can just get them past the first year or so, the likelihood to stay goes up exponentially. Our team members are the face of our brands, and we will continue to invest in training programs, technology and provide opportunities for advancement to ensure they remain with us. 
Finally, for me, just a quick update on routing and scheduling. For the third quarter, we again, had improvements in driving and route efficiency as we clocked 571,000 less miles driven. This improved efficiency comes on the heels of a 1.4 million mile reduction in Q3 last year, and we have now had 19 consecutive months of mileage reductions. 
Now let me turn the call look over to Eddie."
300753,639074841,1840532,"Rollins, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge.

Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the ongoing business expenses, headwinds of employee benefits, foreign currency exchange and Clark integration items, we made tremendous improvements in all of our financial metrics for the quarter and are positioned well to end the year on a very strong note. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed exceptional growth and key to the quarter included: finalization of the Rollins' pension risk transfer; expansion of our Glympse communication to our residential customer base; and a return to margin growth year-over-year. 
Before we proceed with the review of our financial results, I hope that you've had a chance to review our press release from October 3 related to our pension risk transfer. If not, it is posted on our website to view. 
Our overfunded status grew from our original estimate of 104% to nearly 111%. As noted in the press release, we will be using these cash proceeds to fund our company 401(k) match over the next several quarters and pay other plan-related expenses. Once these steps are completed, we will anticipate bringing $6 million to $8 million in cash back to the company for additional deployment. 
The accounting adjustment was also significantly lower than our original estimate, mainly driven by lower interest rates. This accounting pension adjustment flowed through our P&L in Q3 and was approximately $50 million before tax. 
As you know, this is a onetime noncash occurrence. As Gary said, I will be discussing our GAAP metrics, and then spending time on our non-GAAP financial metrics that exclude the pension adjustment. 
For the quarter, we are only calling out the pension adjustment for our non-GAAP results. But a few other items to keep in mind with regards to our net income for the quarter related to our Clark acquisition are: depreciation of $1.4 million for the quarter for buildings and vehicles added; amortization of intangibles, up $2.9 million for customer contracts; interest expense was $2.8 million related to the borrowing of Clark; professional services up $800,000 as Clark uses a large number of subcontractors, and this is a higher percentage of revenue than our -- than in our other Rollins' brands. These categories equate to $7.9 million and as they subside or lapped will continue to improve our year-over-year margin expansion moving forward. 
As we look through our numbers, I will give you GAAP numbers that include our pension accounting adjustment and then transition to our non-GAAP numbers that reflect our true operating results, again, only with the pension loss eliminated. 
So with the pension, looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenue was $556.5 million. That was an increase of 14.1% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $487.7 million. 
Again, with the pension adjustment included, income before income taxes was $46.1 million or 48.7% below 2018. 
Net income was $44.1 million, down 33.9% compared to 2018. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. 
Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax rose 6.8% to $96 million compared to $89.9 million in 2018. 
We had a slightly higher tax rate this quarter at 26.4%, but feel that our full year rate will be in the low 20s with our Q3 pension entry. Our net income rose 6% to $70.6 million and EPS were $0.22 per diluted share, up from $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018, a 10% increase. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, our best financial measure at this time is EBITDA, which was $120.6 million compared to $106.7 million in 2018, a 13% increase. We have only had one other quarter outside of the quarter with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that eclipsed this growth since 2014. 
With the pension, revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, was $1.509 billion, an increase of 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.377 billion. 
Income before income taxes decreased 20.9% to $189.2 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 15.6% to $152.6 million and earnings per share were $0.47, down 14.5% for the 2018 number of $0.55. EBITDA was $252.1 million, down 12.9% compared to 2018. 
Without the pension adjustment, income before income tax decreased 0.1% to $239 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 0.1% to $179.2 million and earnings per share were $0.55 flat to the previous year. EBITDA was $302 million, up 4.3% compared to 2018. 
Our technology road map continues to pay healthy dividends with regards to operational efficiency improvements and an improved customer experience. 
John mentioned the improvements in miles driven for the quarter as we continue to see improvements year-over-year since the inception of our routing and scheduling initiatives, which started in 2016. 
These reductions increased the time our technicians can spend with the customers and increases the technician's capacity. 
As of September, we have added over 70% of our Orkin residential routes to Glympse. Each customer on these routes is receiving multiple proactive text or e-mail notifications from the technician, beginning days in advance and culminating when they're on their way to the customer. This technology is the best in the industry and our early results show improved customer retention for each of our mature branches that are providing this enhanced customer communication. 
We anticipate these results to continue to improve our customer retention and margin for quarters and years to come, much like we have seen from our routing and scheduling results. 
Let's take a look to the Rollins' revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase was 14.1% and included 7.7% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 6.4% was from pricing and organic growth. 
This is the strongest organic growth rate in a quarter since 2013. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 17.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 17% of our revenue, was up 15.4%. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 6.4%. From that, residential was up 8%; commercial increased 3.5%; and termite and ancillary grew 7.9%. This was the largest commercial increase in over a year. 
The revenue strength this quarter is a combination of the late season that did not materialize in Q1 or Q2, execution by our operations and a great job by our sales force. One of Gary's famous quotes is, ""The season always comes."" At some point, it does get warm and the pests do come out and the season does start. In most years, that strength is seen in May and June and impacts Q2. 
As you know, that did not occur this year, but our year-to-date revenue growth, ex currency and M&A, is moving in a direction to be in line or higher than the past 3 years. The key is that demand does not evaporate. When it gets warm, the bugs come out. This year, that did not happen until July, but it did in a really big way. 
In total, gross margin improved 51 -- to 51.7% from 51.6%, prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories such as service salaries, sales salaries, personnel-related and professional services, all related to the acquisition of Clark. 
These increases were offset by reductions in administrative salaries due to improved efficiency and reduction in materials and supplies. 
The additional Clark items that I've just mentioned, impacted the margin by almost a full percentage point. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.8 million to $21.7 million, an increase of 28.6%. 
Depreciation increased $1.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.1 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $22.1 million or 15.2% to $167.2 million or 30% of revenues, up 0.3 percentage points from $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2018. 
The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased sales competition, compensation, enhanced 401(k) plan expense, maintenance and IT contract expense. 
As for our cash position for the period ended September 30, 2019, we spent $431.2 million on acquisitions compared to $71.8 million for the same period last year, which, of course, included Clark. We paid $103.1 million on dividends and had $18.7 million of CapEx, which was up 4.8% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. We ended the period with $104.4 million in cash, of which $71 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on December 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 11, 2019. In addition, the Board declared a special dividend of $0.05, also payable when the regular dividend is paid. 
For the regular cash dividend, this is the 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% and the seventh year in a row the Board has declared a special dividend. 
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

We have a QA group that will look on the backside to make sure that a good quality service is being done. And they'll also help to manage any claims related issues or concerns that might be out there to be able to help to minimize that in any way possible. We also take a look carefully at the contracts that we offer that are available out there, kind of based on the different type of termite and the different areas of the country to make sure that we feel like that it's the right risk to be able to take in the different areas."

Jamie, no doubt, the market is frothy from that perspective in terms of the opportunity to buy these companies.

We certainly go after the small ones. Just like we do the bigger ones, the -- they can provide a tremendous opportunity to tuck in to a location and really improve that -- the density -- the route density of that branch and that business. And so that's usually the approach we'll take with those. 
But from an employee perspective, we take the same approach as we do from -- with the bigger ones because as I like to say, our team -- in our business, when you buy a company, you don't buy a lot of hard assets, all you get are employees and customers and neither has to stay. And so if we don't treat the employee well and onboard them well and integrate them well, then that customer won't be there at the end of the day either.

We know that there are other players that if you look back 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, they may not have been in the market.

We've really concentrated on areas where we know that there's less price sensitivity. So we've really shifted our focus probably over the last 18 months from a new customer perspective, really looking at those areas. There's lots of different groups that -- companies that have their own margin pressure, and that can be pushed along to all of their vendors. And we're continuing to move away from those and continue to concentrated areas where there's less price sensitivity, and they care more about the quality and they're willing to pay for the quality of the service. 
So we're seeing some more retention from that because the quality of service that we're able to attain, and I think that's helping us to be able to continue to incrementally improve and in this case, have a pretty healthy jump as far as the commercial is concerned."

But there was significant pent-up demand, but I would also say that we had great marketing initiatives and our operations executed extremely well to be able to have a higher retention rate from a customer perspective, which I think will help us from an organic revenue perspective as we're moving forward in time. 
So I think the combination of those things helped with the record that we saw this quarter, and I think are going to help us as we move forward.

Well, first and foremost, we're pleased with our third quarter execution and results across all of our business service lines. The warm weather finally appeared thankfully, although later than normal. As a result, we experienced a strong delayed demand for our pest control services. Following a less than satisfactory second quarter, we worked diligently to ensure that we rightsized our head count and reduced expenses that weren't essential for the quarter. We're proud that our team responded effectively. 
It's also noteworthy that many of our investments and programs continued to generate improved levels of employee retention. 
This is an important step to improving customer service in the field and in administration. 
In addition earlier this month, we completed the transition of our fully funded U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. This will provide our company with several accomplishments. We will be eliminating the annual pension contribution, insurance fees, administrative cost, pension management and other related cost of the plan. There will be ongoing cash savings. Our employees, since freezing of the plan in 2006, have enjoyed significant enhancements to their benefits, most recently to their 401(k) plan. Eddie will provide more detail on the pension discontinuation in his remarks. 
Record revenues for the quarter rose 14.1% to $556.5 million compared to revenues of $487.7 million in the third quarter of last year.
Diluted net income of $44.1 million or $0.13 per share was impacted by the noncash pension settlement cost that compares to $66.6 million or $0.20 in 2018. 
Revenues for the first 9 months rose 9.6% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.377 billion for the same period last year. 
Net income was approximately $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared to $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.56 for (sic) [ $0.55] the first 9 months of last year. Eddie will review the non-GAAP results shortly as they're very meaningful. 
We experienced strong growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 17.6%, commercial pest control rose 9.2% and termite and ancillary services grew 15.4%. We believe our third quarter results reflect both the resiliency of our company and our team's ability to respond to operational challenges. 
Before turning the call over to John, just a quick update on Clark. John and I visited again with the team in California this quarter, and the more time we spend with Clark and their employees, the more excited we are about having them as a member to our family of brands. We're making great strides with our integration as they are now live on our fleet system, fully transitioned into our 401(k) program and improving their telecom systems. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John?"

With the warmer weather experienced during the third quarter, mosquitoes, among other pests, were much more active. Even as the population is becoming more aware of the health threats of mosquitoes, there is still much to be done in this area. Eastern Equine Encephalitis, West Nile, Zika and other diseases caused by mosquito bites are becoming a greater health threat. 
We continue to work with various agencies and organizations in an effort to educate the public about these mosquito risks. In order to meet this public threat, we have worked persistently over the years to add mosquito services in all branch locations. This year, we have grown that service line by more than 30%, and this has helped greatly to propel us to our 6.4% overall organic growth rate for the quarter. 
Additionally, we know that coupling these and other service offerings together for our customers, clearly lengthens our relationship with that customer, increasing the revenue received. 
Now I'd like to share with you some exciting news regarding one of our brands. Northwest Exterminating, last week at the National Pest Management Association meetings, Northwest received the National Pest Management Association Gives Award. The NPMA Gives Award recognizes member companies that have demonstrated leadership through dedication and contribution to their community. 
Rollins has increasingly encouraged our brands to give back to their communities and Northwest has certainly led the way in this effort. We are proud of this recognition and want to congratulate our team at Northwest. 
In 2006, Northwest introduced their Green Pest Control program, which is a rather unique service offering, targeting common household pests, ants, spiders, roaches, mice, centipedes, millipedes and more, using only high-quality nontoxic products derived from botanicals, such as flowers, plants and natural elements from the earth, as well as an IPM or integrated pest management approach, utilizing exclusion techniques to keep pests out in the first place. 
Over time, this program has expanded to include a Green Elite offering as well as other Green services, such as termite, mosquito and lawn care. Northwest Green programs are continuing to grow with an increasing desire among homeowners for nonchemical treatment in pest control. Overall, these programs are greatly contributing to Northwest's impressive growth rate as this brand has produced the highest growth of any Rollins' brands during the quarter. 
Gary previously noted our strong employer retention, and I'm pleased to be able to say that we have continued our improvement in that important metric through the third quarter of this year. We talk about retention a lot in our businesses as we can't stress enough that for a service provider, the importance to ensuring our employees remain happy and motivated in their jobs is paramount. 
A happy employee translates to a happy customer. 
We have largely focused our field team efforts in 3 ways to gain this improvement. First, we conduct exit surveys to focus on why people leave as well as concerted employee engagement assessment efforts to ensure our teams feels they have a voice in making things better. 
And last is the effort to improve the onboarding and orientation experience our people undergo. We know if we can just get them past the first year or so, the likelihood to stay goes up exponentially. Our team members are the face of our brands, and we will continue to invest in training programs, technology and provide opportunities for advancement to ensure they remain with us. 
Finally, for me, just a quick update on routing and scheduling. For the third quarter, we again, had improvements in driving and route efficiency as we clocked 571,000 less miles driven. This improved efficiency comes on the heels of a 1.4 million mile reduction in Q3 last year, and we have now had 19 consecutive months of mileage reductions. 
Now let me turn the call look over to Eddie."
300753,639074841,1841902,"Rollins, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge.

Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the ongoing business expenses, headwinds of employee benefits, foreign currency exchange and Clark integration items, we made tremendous improvements in all of our financial metrics for the quarter and are positioned well to end the year on a very strong note. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed exceptional growth and key to the quarter included: finalization of the Rollins' pension risk transfer; expansion of our Glympse communication to our residential customer base; and a return to margin growth year-over-year. 
Before we proceed with the review of our financial results, I hope that you've had a chance to review our press release from October 3 related to our pension risk transfer. If not, it is posted on our website to view. 
Our overfunded status grew from our original estimate of 104% to nearly 111%. As noted in the press release, we will be using these cash proceeds to fund our company 401(k) match over the next several quarters and pay other plan-related expenses. Once these steps are completed, we will anticipate bringing $6 million to $8 million in cash back to the company for additional deployment. 
The accounting adjustment was also significantly lower than our original estimate, mainly driven by lower interest rates. This accounting pension adjustment flowed through our P&L in Q3 and was approximately $50 million before tax. 
As you know, this is a onetime noncash occurrence. As Gary said, I will be discussing our GAAP metrics, and then spending time on our non-GAAP financial metrics that exclude the pension adjustment. 
For the quarter, we are only calling out the pension adjustment for our non-GAAP results. But a few other items to keep in mind with regards to our net income for the quarter related to our Clark acquisition are: depreciation of $1.4 million for the quarter for buildings and vehicles added; amortization of intangibles, up $2.9 million for customer contracts; interest expense was $2.8 million related to the borrowing of Clark; professional services up $800,000 as Clark uses a large number of subcontractors, and this is a higher percentage of revenue than our -- than in our other Rollins' brands. These categories equate to $7.9 million and as they subside or lapped will continue to improve our year-over-year margin expansion moving forward. 
As we look through our numbers, I will give you GAAP numbers that include our pension accounting adjustment and then transition to our non-GAAP numbers that reflect our true operating results, again, only with the pension loss eliminated. 
So with the pension, looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenue was $556.5 million. That was an increase of 14.1% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $487.7 million. 
Again, with the pension adjustment included, income before income taxes was $46.1 million or 48.7% below 2018. 
Net income was $44.1 million, down 33.9% compared to 2018. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. 
Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax rose 6.8% to $96 million compared to $89.9 million in 2018. 
We had a slightly higher tax rate this quarter at 26.4%, but feel that our full year rate will be in the low 20s with our Q3 pension entry. Our net income rose 6% to $70.6 million and EPS were $0.22 per diluted share, up from $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018, a 10% increase. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, our best financial measure at this time is EBITDA, which was $120.6 million compared to $106.7 million in 2018, a 13% increase. We have only had one other quarter outside of the quarter with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that eclipsed this growth since 2014. 
With the pension, revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, was $1.509 billion, an increase of 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.377 billion. 
Income before income taxes decreased 20.9% to $189.2 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 15.6% to $152.6 million and earnings per share were $0.47, down 14.5% for the 2018 number of $0.55. EBITDA was $252.1 million, down 12.9% compared to 2018. 
Without the pension adjustment, income before income tax decreased 0.1% to $239 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 0.1% to $179.2 million and earnings per share were $0.55 flat to the previous year. EBITDA was $302 million, up 4.3% compared to 2018. 
Our technology road map continues to pay healthy dividends with regards to operational efficiency improvements and an improved customer experience. 
John mentioned the improvements in miles driven for the quarter as we continue to see improvements year-over-year since the inception of our routing and scheduling initiatives, which started in 2016. 
These reductions increased the time our technicians can spend with the customers and increases the technician's capacity. 
As of September, we have added over 70% of our Orkin residential routes to Glympse. Each customer on these routes is receiving multiple proactive text or e-mail notifications from the technician, beginning days in advance and culminating when they're on their way to the customer. This technology is the best in the industry and our early results show improved customer retention for each of our mature branches that are providing this enhanced customer communication. 
We anticipate these results to continue to improve our customer retention and margin for quarters and years to come, much like we have seen from our routing and scheduling results. 
Let's take a look to the Rollins' revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase was 14.1% and included 7.7% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 6.4% was from pricing and organic growth. 
This is the strongest organic growth rate in a quarter since 2013. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 17.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 17% of our revenue, was up 15.4%. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 6.4%. From that, residential was up 8%; commercial increased 3.5%; and termite and ancillary grew 7.9%. This was the largest commercial increase in over a year. 
The revenue strength this quarter is a combination of the late season that did not materialize in Q1 or Q2, execution by our operations and a great job by our sales force. One of Gary's famous quotes is, ""The season always comes."" At some point, it does get warm and the pests do come out and the season does start. In most years, that strength is seen in May and June and impacts Q2. 
As you know, that did not occur this year, but our year-to-date revenue growth, ex currency and M&A, is moving in a direction to be in line or higher than the past 3 years. The key is that demand does not evaporate. When it gets warm, the bugs come out. This year, that did not happen until July, but it did in a really big way. 
In total, gross margin improved 51 -- to 51.7% from 51.6%, prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories such as service salaries, sales salaries, personnel-related and professional services, all related to the acquisition of Clark. 
These increases were offset by reductions in administrative salaries due to improved efficiency and reduction in materials and supplies. 
The additional Clark items that I've just mentioned, impacted the margin by almost a full percentage point. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.8 million to $21.7 million, an increase of 28.6%. 
Depreciation increased $1.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.1 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $22.1 million or 15.2% to $167.2 million or 30% of revenues, up 0.3 percentage points from $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2018. 
The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased sales competition, compensation, enhanced 401(k) plan expense, maintenance and IT contract expense. 
As for our cash position for the period ended September 30, 2019, we spent $431.2 million on acquisitions compared to $71.8 million for the same period last year, which, of course, included Clark. We paid $103.1 million on dividends and had $18.7 million of CapEx, which was up 4.8% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. We ended the period with $104.4 million in cash, of which $71 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on December 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 11, 2019. In addition, the Board declared a special dividend of $0.05, also payable when the regular dividend is paid. 
For the regular cash dividend, this is the 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% and the seventh year in a row the Board has declared a special dividend. 
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

We have a QA group that will look on the backside to make sure that a good quality service is being done. And they'll also help to manage any claims related issues or concerns that might be out there to be able to help to minimize that in any way possible. We also take a look carefully at the contracts that we offer that are available out there, kind of based on the different type of termite and the different areas of the country to make sure that we feel like that it's the right risk to be able to take in the different areas."

But from an employee perspective, we take the same approach as we do from -- with the bigger ones because as I like to say, our team -- in our business, when you buy a company, you don't buy a lot of hard assets, all you get are employees and customers and neither has to stay. And so if we don't treat the employee well and onboard them well and integrate them well, then that customer won't be there at the end of the day either.

We know that there are other players that if you look back 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, they may not have been in the market. We're still seeing very rational pricing that is out there in most cases that are available. 
We've really concentrated on areas where we know that there's less price sensitivity. So we've really shifted our focus probably over the last 18 months from a new customer perspective, really looking at those areas. There's lots of different groups that -- companies that have their own margin pressure, and that can be pushed along to all of their vendors. And we're continuing to move away from those and continue to concentrated areas where there's less price sensitivity, and they care more about the quality and they're willing to pay for the quality of the service. 
So we're seeing some more retention from that because the quality of service that we're able to attain, and I think that's helping us to be able to continue to incrementally improve and in this case, have a pretty healthy jump as far as the commercial is concerned."

We've talked about pent-up demand. Gary talks regularly about looking at a full year as far as revenue growth because there is going to be fluctuation that's going to occur between the different quarters. Of course, this year was tremendously different than anything that we've seen in previous years, and I think Gary probably would say the same thing, in his time period it was completely different. 
But there was significant pent-up demand, but I would also say that we had great marketing initiatives and our operations executed extremely well to be able to have a higher retention rate from a customer perspective, which I think will help us from an organic revenue perspective as we're moving forward in time. 
So I think the combination of those things helped with the record that we saw this quarter, and I think are going to help us as we move forward. The technology that we put in place with Glympse, and John talked about our routing and scheduling, is making it a better job for our technician and it's making it a better customer experience from a customer's perspective.

Well, first and foremost, we're pleased with our third quarter execution and results across all of our business service lines. The warm weather finally appeared thankfully, although later than normal. As a result, we experienced a strong delayed demand for our pest control services. Following a less than satisfactory second quarter, we worked diligently to ensure that we rightsized our head count and reduced expenses that weren't essential for the quarter. We're proud that our team responded effectively. 
It's also noteworthy that many of our investments and programs continued to generate improved levels of employee retention. 
This is an important step to improving customer service in the field and in administration. 
In addition earlier this month, we completed the transition of our fully funded U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. This will provide our company with several accomplishments. We will be eliminating the annual pension contribution, insurance fees, administrative cost, pension management and other related cost of the plan. There will be ongoing cash savings. Our employees, since freezing of the plan in 2006, have enjoyed significant enhancements to their benefits, most recently to their 401(k) plan. Eddie will provide more detail on the pension discontinuation in his remarks. 
Record revenues for the quarter rose 14.1% to $556.5 million compared to revenues of $487.7 million in the third quarter of last year.
Diluted net income of $44.1 million or $0.13 per share was impacted by the noncash pension settlement cost that compares to $66.6 million or $0.20 in 2018. 
Revenues for the first 9 months rose 9.6% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.377 billion for the same period last year. 
Net income was approximately $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared to $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.56 for (sic) [ $0.55] the first 9 months of last year. Eddie will review the non-GAAP results shortly as they're very meaningful. 
We experienced strong growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 17.6%, commercial pest control rose 9.2% and termite and ancillary services grew 15.4%. We believe our third quarter results reflect both the resiliency of our company and our team's ability to respond to operational challenges. 
Before turning the call over to John, just a quick update on Clark. John and I visited again with the team in California this quarter, and the more time we spend with Clark and their employees, the more excited we are about having them as a member to our family of brands. We're making great strides with our integration as they are now live on our fleet system, fully transitioned into our 401(k) program and improving their telecom systems. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John?"

With the warmer weather experienced during the third quarter, mosquitoes, among other pests, were much more active. Even as the population is becoming more aware of the health threats of mosquitoes, there is still much to be done in this area. Eastern Equine Encephalitis, West Nile, Zika and other diseases caused by mosquito bites are becoming a greater health threat. 
We continue to work with various agencies and organizations in an effort to educate the public about these mosquito risks. In order to meet this public threat, we have worked persistently over the years to add mosquito services in all branch locations. This year, we have grown that service line by more than 30%, and this has helped greatly to propel us to our 6.4% overall organic growth rate for the quarter. 
Additionally, we know that coupling these and other service offerings together for our customers, clearly lengthens our relationship with that customer, increasing the revenue received. 
Now I'd like to share with you some exciting news regarding one of our brands. Northwest Exterminating, last week at the National Pest Management Association meetings, Northwest received the National Pest Management Association Gives Award. The NPMA Gives Award recognizes member companies that have demonstrated leadership through dedication and contribution to their community. 
Rollins has increasingly encouraged our brands to give back to their communities and Northwest has certainly led the way in this effort. We are proud of this recognition and want to congratulate our team at Northwest. 
In 2006, Northwest introduced their Green Pest Control program, which is a rather unique service offering, targeting common household pests, ants, spiders, roaches, mice, centipedes, millipedes and more, using only high-quality nontoxic products derived from botanicals, such as flowers, plants and natural elements from the earth, as well as an IPM or integrated pest management approach, utilizing exclusion techniques to keep pests out in the first place. 
Over time, this program has expanded to include a Green Elite offering as well as other Green services, such as termite, mosquito and lawn care. Northwest Green programs are continuing to grow with an increasing desire among homeowners for nonchemical treatment in pest control. Overall, these programs are greatly contributing to Northwest's impressive growth rate as this brand has produced the highest growth of any Rollins' brands during the quarter. 
Gary previously noted our strong employer retention, and I'm pleased to be able to say that we have continued our improvement in that important metric through the third quarter of this year. We talk about retention a lot in our businesses as we can't stress enough that for a service provider, the importance to ensuring our employees remain happy and motivated in their jobs is paramount. 
A happy employee translates to a happy customer. 
We have largely focused our field team efforts in 3 ways to gain this improvement. First, we conduct exit surveys to focus on why people leave as well as concerted employee engagement assessment efforts to ensure our teams feels they have a voice in making things better. 
And last is the effort to improve the onboarding and orientation experience our people undergo. We know if we can just get them past the first year or so, the likelihood to stay goes up exponentially. Our team members are the face of our brands, and we will continue to invest in training programs, technology and provide opportunities for advancement to ensure they remain with us. 
Finally, for me, just a quick update on routing and scheduling. For the third quarter, we again, had improvements in driving and route efficiency as we clocked 571,000 less miles driven. This improved efficiency comes on the heels of a 1.4 million mile reduction in Q3 last year, and we have now had 19 consecutive months of mileage reductions. 
Now let me turn the call look over to Eddie."
300753,639074841,1841903,"Rollins, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge.

Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the ongoing business expenses, headwinds of employee benefits, foreign currency exchange and Clark integration items, we made tremendous improvements in all of our financial metrics for the quarter and are positioned well to end the year on a very strong note. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed exceptional growth and key to the quarter included: finalization of the Rollins' pension risk transfer; expansion of our Glympse communication to our residential customer base; and a return to margin growth year-over-year. 
Before we proceed with the review of our financial results, I hope that you've had a chance to review our press release from October 3 related to our pension risk transfer. If not, it is posted on our website to view. 
Our overfunded status grew from our original estimate of 104% to nearly 111%. As noted in the press release, we will be using these cash proceeds to fund our company 401(k) match over the next several quarters and pay other plan-related expenses. Once these steps are completed, we will anticipate bringing $6 million to $8 million in cash back to the company for additional deployment. 
The accounting adjustment was also significantly lower than our original estimate, mainly driven by lower interest rates. This accounting pension adjustment flowed through our P&L in Q3 and was approximately $50 million before tax. 
As you know, this is a onetime noncash occurrence. As Gary said, I will be discussing our GAAP metrics, and then spending time on our non-GAAP financial metrics that exclude the pension adjustment. 
For the quarter, we are only calling out the pension adjustment for our non-GAAP results. But a few other items to keep in mind with regards to our net income for the quarter related to our Clark acquisition are: depreciation of $1.4 million for the quarter for buildings and vehicles added; amortization of intangibles, up $2.9 million for customer contracts; interest expense was $2.8 million related to the borrowing of Clark; professional services up $800,000 as Clark uses a large number of subcontractors, and this is a higher percentage of revenue than our -- than in our other Rollins' brands. These categories equate to $7.9 million and as they subside or lapped will continue to improve our year-over-year margin expansion moving forward. 
As we look through our numbers, I will give you GAAP numbers that include our pension accounting adjustment and then transition to our non-GAAP numbers that reflect our true operating results, again, only with the pension loss eliminated. 
So with the pension, looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenue was $556.5 million. That was an increase of 14.1% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $487.7 million. 
Again, with the pension adjustment included, income before income taxes was $46.1 million or 48.7% below 2018. 
Net income was $44.1 million, down 33.9% compared to 2018. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. 
Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax rose 6.8% to $96 million compared to $89.9 million in 2018. 
We had a slightly higher tax rate this quarter at 26.4%, but feel that our full year rate will be in the low 20s with our Q3 pension entry. Our net income rose 6% to $70.6 million and EPS were $0.22 per diluted share, up from $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018, a 10% increase. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, our best financial measure at this time is EBITDA, which was $120.6 million compared to $106.7 million in 2018, a 13% increase. We have only had one other quarter outside of the quarter with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that eclipsed this growth since 2014. 
With the pension, revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2019, was $1.509 billion, an increase of 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.377 billion. 
Income before income taxes decreased 20.9% to $189.2 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 15.6% to $152.6 million and earnings per share were $0.47, down 14.5% for the 2018 number of $0.55. EBITDA was $252.1 million, down 12.9% compared to 2018. 
Without the pension adjustment, income before income tax decreased 0.1% to $239 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 0.1% to $179.2 million and earnings per share were $0.55 flat to the previous year. EBITDA was $302 million, up 4.3% compared to 2018. 
Our technology road map continues to pay healthy dividends with regards to operational efficiency improvements and an improved customer experience. 
John mentioned the improvements in miles driven for the quarter as we continue to see improvements year-over-year since the inception of our routing and scheduling initiatives, which started in 2016. 
These reductions increased the time our technicians can spend with the customers and increases the technician's capacity. 
As of September, we have added over 70% of our Orkin residential routes to Glympse. Each customer on these routes is receiving multiple proactive text or e-mail notifications from the technician, beginning days in advance and culminating when they're on their way to the customer. This technology is the best in the industry and our early results show improved customer retention for each of our mature branches that are providing this enhanced customer communication. 
We anticipate these results to continue to improve our customer retention and margin for quarters and years to come, much like we have seen from our routing and scheduling results. 
Let's take a look to the Rollins' revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase was 14.1% and included 7.7% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 6.4% was from pricing and organic growth. 
This is the strongest organic growth rate in a quarter since 2013. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 17.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 17% of our revenue, was up 15.4%. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 6.4%. From that, residential was up 8%; commercial increased 3.5%; and termite and ancillary grew 7.9%. This was the largest commercial increase in over a year. 
The revenue strength this quarter is a combination of the late season that did not materialize in Q1 or Q2, execution by our operations and a great job by our sales force. One of Gary's famous quotes is, ""The season always comes."" At some point, it does get warm and the pests do come out and the season does start. In most years, that strength is seen in May and June and impacts Q2. 
As you know, that did not occur this year, but our year-to-date revenue growth, ex currency and M&A, is moving in a direction to be in line or higher than the past 3 years. The key is that demand does not evaporate. When it gets warm, the bugs come out. This year, that did not happen until July, but it did in a really big way. 
In total, gross margin improved 51 -- to 51.7% from 51.6%, prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories such as service salaries, sales salaries, personnel-related and professional services, all related to the acquisition of Clark. 
These increases were offset by reductions in administrative salaries due to improved efficiency and reduction in materials and supplies. 
The additional Clark items that I've just mentioned, impacted the margin by almost a full percentage point. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.8 million to $21.7 million, an increase of 28.6%. 
Depreciation increased $1.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.1 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $22.1 million or 15.2% to $167.2 million or 30% of revenues, up 0.3 percentage points from $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2018. 
The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased sales competition, compensation, enhanced 401(k) plan expense, maintenance and IT contract expense. 
As for our cash position for the period ended September 30, 2019, we spent $431.2 million on acquisitions compared to $71.8 million for the same period last year, which, of course, included Clark. We paid $103.1 million on dividends and had $18.7 million of CapEx, which was up 4.8% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. We ended the period with $104.4 million in cash, of which $71 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on December 10, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 11, 2019. In addition, the Board declared a special dividend of $0.05, also payable when the regular dividend is paid. 
For the regular cash dividend, this is the 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% and the seventh year in a row the Board has declared a special dividend. 
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

But we've talked about, on previous calls, that we have our internal credit department that enables us to really be able to help with the closing tool for that. So it's a great quality service from a termite perspective. And we also have that ability for our customers to be able to use our internal credit department.

We have a QA group that will look on the backside to make sure that a good quality service is being done. And they'll also help to manage any claims related issues or concerns that might be out there to be able to help to minimize that in any way possible. We also take a look carefully at the contracts that we offer that are available out there, kind of based on the different type of termite and the different areas of the country to make sure that we feel like that it's the right risk to be able to take in the different areas."

We certainly go after the small ones. Just like we do the bigger ones, the -- they can provide a tremendous opportunity to tuck in to a location and really improve that -- the density -- the route density of that branch and that business. And so that's usually the approach we'll take with those. 
But from an employee perspective, we take the same approach as we do from -- with the bigger ones because as I like to say, our team -- in our business, when you buy a company, you don't buy a lot of hard assets, all you get are employees and customers and neither has to stay. And so if we don't treat the employee well and onboard them well and integrate them well, then that customer won't be there at the end of the day either.

We know that there are other players that if you look back 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, they may not have been in the market. We're still seeing very rational pricing that is out there in most cases that are available. 
We've really concentrated on areas where we know that there's less price sensitivity. So we've really shifted our focus probably over the last 18 months from a new customer perspective, really looking at those areas. There's lots of different groups that -- companies that have their own margin pressure, and that can be pushed along to all of their vendors. And we're continuing to move away from those and continue to concentrated areas where there's less price sensitivity, and they care more about the quality and they're willing to pay for the quality of the service. 
So we're seeing some more retention from that because the quality of service that we're able to attain, and I think that's helping us to be able to continue to incrementally improve and in this case, have a pretty healthy jump as far as the commercial is concerned."

We've talked about pent-up demand. Gary talks regularly about looking at a full year as far as revenue growth because there is going to be fluctuation that's going to occur between the different quarters. Of course, this year was tremendously different than anything that we've seen in previous years, and I think Gary probably would say the same thing, in his time period it was completely different. 
But there was significant pent-up demand, but I would also say that we had great marketing initiatives and our operations executed extremely well to be able to have a higher retention rate from a customer perspective, which I think will help us from an organic revenue perspective as we're moving forward in time. 
So I think the combination of those things helped with the record that we saw this quarter, and I think are going to help us as we move forward. The technology that we put in place with Glympse, and John talked about our routing and scheduling, is making it a better job for our technician and it's making it a better customer experience from a customer's perspective.
