After reducing guidance in the middle of 2018, we beat those reduced the forecast in both the third and fourth quarters on an adjusted basis. That said, we have not met our own expectations for overall performance, and we are intensely focused on improving results. We have set guidance for 2019 that is pretty well balanced for external purposes that reflects current trends early in the year and assume improvement as we move through the year at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK. 
In addition to the ongoing of the business, I would want to highlight important decisions and events, including: the closure of Henri Bendel; the sale of La Senza; reducing our regular dividend by half to normalize payout and free up funds to reduce our near-term debt levels, the appointment of Amy Hauk to run PINK and the hiring of John Mehas to lead Victoria's Secret Lingerie; the continued proactive and disciplined management of inventory, expenses, real estate and capital structure; a heightened focus on the customer and our merchandise excitement at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK; and finally, an ongoing mindset of everything is on the table for review and change.

Our thoughts on the intimate apparel category are that's it's a great category. I think 1 observation reflection I would have on others entering the category is they're doing so because it's an attractive category. It's got the opportunity for differentiation. It inherently when it's intimate apparel under underwear has emotional content, and from that a lot of economic value can be created for companies participants in the category. So we think it's a great category. In terms of recent developments, pricing pressure, commoditization, at the end of the day, it comes back to the merchandise. If the merchandise is special, unique, reflects fashion, has newness, has technical benefit, there are terrific opportunities in the category, so we feel very good about the category. And again, I would characterize the entrance of new participants frankly as a sign of that in that it's an attractive category. So with that said, we're meeting our expectations right now in the category. We are not -- we are obviously very focused on improving the trend of our business and John Mehas and Amie particularly most focused on improving the merchandise.

Our store closure plans are heightened in 2018, and we pulled back on investing in new and remodeling -- new stores and the remodeling of stores substantially over the last several years. But truly everything is on the table. Amy's been in seat since October and John's just a couple of weeks in, so you can appreciate that though I want to make sure that they have a full appreciation of the situation before they make major changes, but with that said, they're very intensely engaged in the business and again, most focused on the merchandise. But truly, everything is on the table.

But truly, everything is on the table with the dominant focus on the customer and on the merchandise. Thanks."

It's parts of L Brands, as you know. I'm sorry to have a little bit of humor here. But that important part of our business was actually able to reduce promotional activity in 2018 and particularly in the fourth quarter, so what really drives that promotional level in these businesses is the quality of the merchandise and the quality of running the business in a disciplined manner. And we get that right, compelling, fresh merchandise, promotional levels come down, AURs go up, margins are healthy, inventory turns are strong, and Bath & Body has a strong record of that and had incremental progress in 2018 in terms of reducing promotion. With respect to Victoria's Secret, the mindset of the thinking is the same, which is when you get the merchandise more right than wrong, you're able to reduce promotion. As you can appreciate, substantial change in the assortment will occur more in the back half of 2019 and in the front half of 2019, so we have the promotional than we would like over the last several years through improvement in the merchandise assortment. With ongoing disciplined management of inventory, we would expect that we'll be able to reduce promotional levels as we move forward, but it's going to take a little bit of time. Hopefully, that answers your question."

It's an important subject you're asking about. I actually would assert it's our 50th wave. And what I mean by that is we close stores every year, so that's an ongoing part of running the business. How you go about it is we look at current and projected performance, sales, profit, cash flow. We look at trade area dynamics and how store openings and closings affect nearby stores and, to a lesser extent, our online business. And based on those historic and projected results, not just for the store in question but for nearby stores, we make judgments about what the projected sales profit cash flow results would be also in relation to what it may cost to exit a store. And based on those criteria, we close stores. In fact, we close stores every year at Bath & Body Works and at Victoria's and we also open stores every year. We are closing more stores in -- we did in 2018 and expected in 2019 based on the overall performance of the Victoria's Secret business, not meeting our expectations or have a year-on-year declines. But that's how we go about it. It's detailed. It's rigorous. It's fact-based. And again, the result is we're closing more stores at Victoria's than we had over the last few years. But again, I wouldn't want you to think that we do it in ways. It's an ongoing part of the good multiunit business whether it's a restaurant business or retail business. It's a good ongoing part of the running of the business. We had a lot of flexibility in our real estate terms, so for those malls that are the most vulnerable malls, we have a lot of opportunity to exit those situations at no cost or with very little cost. So we've got a lot of flexibility. And on an overall basis, are real estate portfolio is in pretty good shape. Do we have some opportunities? We do. We recognized an impairment cost in the results this year, but on an overall basis, our real estate is in good shape, and that's because it's very actively managed as an ongoing part of the running of the business. With respect to relaunching the Victoria's website, I think that was a question. We have been working on that in the last several years. The product is in good shape. We are currently doing testing of the new online platform, a live testing, and expect to go live broadly on that conversion in probably April. But again, it will be a functional testing, which at this point is going well but likely to do that over rally in the April time frame, and we will have the ability to revert back to the legacy system if we have any challenges as we listen to them. But that product is in good shape and will create capability for us, capabilities for us to do a lot of things that we are enthused about doing over the next year or 2 in terms of customer-facing, customer-facing things that many others do today than we will be able to do.

That's the most important assumption. Separately, you're asking about Bath & Body lap tough numbers and to what extent. Bath & Body's are very well led business. It's in a very strong category of retailing in terms of personal care and beauty, and we believe it's reasonable that they can continue their success. Are we expecting the same degree fully? No, ultimately an operating income. The same degree of success in '19 in OI dollars as they produced in '18? No, there's a little bit of moderation in the OI dollar results, but we have confidence that, that business can continue to perform well. It's very well like. It it's a very good category of retailing. They've got good current results, so we think we've made reasonable assumptions with respect to Bath & Body Works, won't be easy by any stretch, but it's a very well-led business and a great category retailing in the recent results have been very good. The more fundamental assumption is the degree and rate of improvement for lingerie and PINK, and we've tried to deliver that appropriately, but as you can appreciate, that's our judgment to make."

Also as we do in our company-owned business in North America, we'll continue to close stores either based on lease expiration or as we open full assortment stores in nearby geography but good growth in terms of store count for international. It is skewed towards the partner-owned businesses because we are moderating our growth at this stage for China and we are not adding stores in the U.K., but good strong store base growth for the international business in total, again 100 and 120 stores and ongoing growth in the digital part of that business, as well as the online part of that business. We think a good growth profile overall with an adjustment in growth in China as we learn more about the appropriate store size and format there, but strong growth online in China as well in 2019.

Our thoughts on the intimate apparel category are that it's a great category. I think the one observation reflection I would have on others entering the category is they're doing so because it's an attractive category. It's got the opportunity for differentiation. It inherently -- when it's intimate apparel versus underwear has emotional content. And from that, a lot of economic value can be created for companies, participants in the category. So we think it's a great category. In terms of recent developments, pricing pressure, commoditization, I mean, at the end of the day, it comes back to the merchandise. If the merchandise is special, unique, reflects fashion, has newness, has technical benefit, there are terrific opportunities in the category. So we feel very good about the category. And again, I would characterize the entrance of new participants, frankly, as a sign of that and that it's an attractive category.

It's part of L Brands, as you know. I'm sorry, I tend to have a little bit of humor here. But that important part of our business was actually able to reduce promotional activity in 2018 and particularly in the fourth quarter. So what really drives that promotional level in these businesses is the quality of the merchandise and the quality of running the business in a disciplined manner. And when we get that right, compelling, fresh merchandise, promotional levels come down, AURs go up, margins are healthy, inventory turns are strong; and Bath & Body has a strong record of that and had incremental progress in 2018 in terms of reducing promotion. With respect to Victoria's Secret, the mindset or the thinking is the same, which is when you get the merchandise more right than wrong, you're able to reduce promotion. As you can appreciate, substantial change in the assortment will occur more in the back half of 2019 and in the front half of 2019. So we have been more promotional than we would like over the last several years through improvement in the merchandise assortment.

Thanks, Kimberly. Thanks for the question. I think the thing that I would add to your framing of what occurred and you're asking for more insight, obviously, is some of our core franchises and particularly Body by Victoria had a deceleration in front, a year-on-year pressure that gotten more significant as we moved through 2018, Kimberly. And that pressure in those core franchises, again, not limited to, but principally Body by Victoria, is really what drove the further pressure as we moved through 2018. And what that comes back to is innovation. Everything's got a life cycle. And as one gets later in life cycles, you got to innovate and update and create differentiation. And we got a bit behind on that in some of these core bra franchises. And you can be sure that John and the team there are intensely focused on that very question and that big opportunity, frankly. And that's going to be a big -- is a big priority as we move to 2019. But in terms of what drove the change in performance, it is that deceleration and some big books of business that were, what I'd call, core sub-brands that have existed for a long time that weren't sufficiently updated with fashion or innovation to continue their strength."

You asked is this the first wave, and I'd -- I'm saying this was a little bit of intended humor. It's an important subject you're asking about. I actually would assert that this is about our 50th wave. And what I mean by that is we close stores every year. So that's an ongoing part of running the business. How we go about it is we look at current and projected performance, sales, profit, cash flow. We look at trade area dynamics and how store openings and closings affect nearby stores and, to a lesser extent, our online business. And based on those historic and projected results not just for the store in question but for nearby stores, we make judgments about what the projected sales profit cash flow results would be also in relation to what it may cost to exit a store. And based on those criteria, we close stores. And in fact, we close stores every year at Bath & Body Works and at Victoria's. And we also open stores every year. We are closing more stores in -- we did in 2018 and expected in 2019 based on the overall performance of the Victoria's Secret business not meeting our expectations or having year-on-year declines. But that's how we go about it. It's detailed. It's rigorous. It's fact-based. And again, the result is we're closing more stores at Victoria's than we have over the last few years. But again, I wouldn't want you to think that we do it in waves. It's an ongoing part of a good multiunit business. Whether it's a restaurant business or a retail business, it's a good ongoing part of the running of the business. We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate terms. So for those malls that are the most vulnerable malls, we have a lot of opportunity to exit those situations with no -- at no cost or with very little cost. So we've got a lot of flexibility. And on an overall basis, our real estate portfolio is in pretty good shape. Do we have some opportunities? We do. We recognized an impairment cost in our results this year. But on an overall basis, our real estate is in good shape. And that's because it is very actively managed as an ongoing part of the running of the business. With respect to relaunching the Victoria's website, I think that was your question. We have been working on that over the last several years. The project is in good shape. We are currently doing testing of the new online platform, a live testing, and expect to go live broadly on that conversion in probably April. But again, it will be a function of testing, which, at this point, is going well, but likely to do the cutover roundly in the April time frame. And we will have the ability to revert back to the legacy system if we have any challenges as we cutover. But that project's in good shape and will create capability for us -- capabilities for us to do a lot of things that we're very enthused about doing over the next year or 2 in terms of consumer-facing -- customer-facing things that many others do today that -- than we will be able to do.

That's the most important assumption. Separately, you're asking about can Bath & Body lap tough numbers and to what extent. Bath & Body is a very well-led business. It's in a very strong category of retailing in terms of personal care and beauty. And we believe it's reasonable that they can continue their success. Are we expecting the same degree fully, ultimately, in our operating income the same degree of success in '19 in OI dollars as they produced in '18? No, there's a little bit of moderation in the OI dollar results. But we have confidence that, that business can continue to perform well. It's very well led. It's in a very good category of retailing. They've got good current results. So we think we've made reasonable assumptions with respect to Bath & Body Works. It won't be easy by any stretch, but it's a very well-led business and a great category retailing. And the recent results have been very good. The more fundamental assumption is the degree and rate of improvement for Lingerie and PINK. And we've tried to deal with that appropriately.

So Dana, first of all, there are multiple components of the International business as you can appreciate. So in terms of how we think about investment, and I would describe this first through the combination of our own company-owned businesses and then also the franchise and partner-owned businesses, we expect to grow the store count meaningfully in the International business in 2019 roundly opening between company-owned and partner-owned stores between 100 and, say, 120 stores. So that's good growth. We'll also -- as we do in our company-owned business in North America, we'll continue to close stores either based on lease expiration or as we open full assortment stores in nearby geography. But good growth in terms of store count for International. It is skewed towards the partner-owned businesses because we're moderating our growth at this stage for China, and we're not adding stores in the U.K. But good, strong store base growth for the International business in total, again, roundly between 100 and 120 stores and an ongoing growth in the digital part of that business as well, the online part of that business.

Am I, from that comment, suggesting we're going to get all of that in 2019? I am not. But through the focus on the customer and the focus on merchandise with ongoing disciplined management of inventories, there is a very substantial opportunity for margin in this business. And it starts and ends with that customer understanding and that strong management on the merchandise assortment. So that's the big-picture answer to your question or, in my view, the most important answer to your question. As we improve the merchandise assortment as we move through 2019, we would expect to see some improvement in year-on-year result on margin rate. But really, that's how I would address the question. Very substantial opportunity. Thanks, Paul."

Our thoughts on the intimate apparel category are that it's a great category. I think the one observation reflection I would have on others entering the category is they're doing so because it's an attractive category. It's got the opportunity for differentiation. It inherently -- when it's intimate apparel versus underwear has emotional content. And from that, a lot of economic value can be created for companies, participants in the category. So we think it's a great category. In terms of recent developments, pricing pressure, commoditization, I mean, at the end of the day, it comes back to the merchandise. If the merchandise is special, unique, reflects fashion, has newness, has technical benefit, there are terrific opportunities in the category. So we feel very good about the category. And again, I would characterize the entrance of new participants, frankly, as a sign of that and that it's an attractive category. So with that said, are we meeting our expectations right now in the category? We're not. And we're obviously very focused on improving the trend of our business, and John Mehas and Amie, particularly, most focused on improving the merchandise. So overall, we think it's a great category.

And we've embarked on detailed review of all those things. Specifically on real estate, our store closure plans are heightened in 2018.

It's part of L Brands, as you know. I'm sorry, I tend to have a little bit of humor here. But that important part of our business was actually able to reduce promotional activity in 2018 and particularly in the fourth quarter. So what really drives that promotional level in these businesses is the quality of the merchandise and the quality of running the business in a disciplined manner. And when we get that right, compelling, fresh merchandise, promotional levels come down, AURs go up, margins are healthy, inventory turns are strong; and Bath & Body has a strong record of that and had incremental progress in 2018 in terms of reducing promotion. With respect to Victoria's Secret, the mindset or the thinking is the same, which is when you get the merchandise more right than wrong, you're able to reduce promotion. As you can appreciate, substantial change in the assortment will occur more in the back half of 2019 than in the front half of 2019. So we have been more promotional than we would like over the last several years through improvement in the merchandise assortment. With ongoing disciplined management of inventory, we would expect that we'll be able to reduce promotional levels as we move forward. But it's going to take a little bit of time.

And that pressure in those core franchises, again, not limited to, but principally Body by Victoria, is really what drove the further pressure as we moved through 2018. And what that comes back to is innovation. Everything's got a life cycle. And as one gets later in life cycles, you got to innovate and update and create differentiation.

You asked is this the first wave, and I'd -- I'm saying this was a little bit of intended humor. It's an important subject you're asking about. I actually would assert that this is about our 50th wave. And what I mean by that is we close stores every year. So that's an ongoing part of running the business. How we go about it is we look at current and projected performance, sales, profit, cash flow. We look at trade area dynamics and how store openings and closings affect nearby stores and, to a lesser extent, our online business. And based on those historic and projected results not just for the store in question but for nearby stores, we make judgments about what the projected sales profit cash flow results would be also in relation to what it may cost to exit a store. And based on those criteria, we close stores. And in fact, we close stores every year at Bath & Body Works and at Victoria's. And we also open stores every year. We are closing more stores in -- we did in 2018 and expected in 2019 based on the overall performance of the Victoria's Secret business not meeting our expectations or having year-on-year declines. But that's how we go about it. It's detailed. It's rigorous. It's fact-based. And again, the result is we're closing more stores at Victoria's than we have over the last few years. But again, I wouldn't want you to think that we do it in waves. It's an ongoing part of a good multiunit business. Whether it's a restaurant business or a retail business, it's a good ongoing part of the running of the business. We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate terms. So for those malls that are the most vulnerable malls, we have a lot of opportunity to exit those situations with no -- at no cost or with very little cost. So we've got a lot of flexibility. And on an overall basis, our real estate portfolio is in pretty good shape. Do we have some opportunities? We do. We recognized an impairment cost in our results this year. But on an overall basis, our real estate is in good shape. And that's because it is very actively managed as an ongoing part of the running of the business. With respect to relaunching the Victoria's website, I think that was your question. We have been working on that over the last several years. The project is in good shape. We are currently doing testing of the new online platform, a live testing, and expect to go live broadly on that conversion in probably April. But again, it will be a function of testing, which, at this point, is going well, but likely to do the cutover roundly in the April time frame. And we will have the ability to revert back to the legacy system if we have any challenges as we cutover. But that project's in good shape and will create capability for us -- capabilities for us to do a lot of things that we're very enthused about doing over the next year or 2 in terms of consumer-facing -- customer-facing things that many others do today that -- than we will be able to do.

That's the most important assumption. Separately, you're asking about can Bath & Body lap tough numbers and to what extent. Bath & Body is a very well-led business. It's in a very strong category of retailing in terms of personal care and beauty. And we believe it's reasonable that they can continue their success. Are we expecting the same degree fully, ultimately, in our operating income the same degree of success in '19 in OI dollars as they produced in '18? No, there's a little bit of moderation in the OI dollar results. But we have confidence that, that business can continue to perform well. It's very well led. It's in a very good category of retailing. They've got good current results. So we think we've made reasonable assumptions with respect to Bath & Body Works. It won't be easy by any stretch, but it's a very well-led business and a great category retailing. And the recent results have been very good. The more fundamental assumption is the degree and rate of improvement for Lingerie and PINK. And we've tried to deal with that appropriately.

So Dana, first of all, there are multiple components of the International business as you can appreciate. So in terms of how we think about investment, and I would describe this first through the combination of our own company-owned businesses and then also the franchise and partner-owned businesses, we expect to grow the store count meaningfully in the International business in 2019 roundly opening between company-owned and partner-owned stores between 100 and, say, 120 stores. So that's good growth. We'll also -- as we do in our company-owned business in North America, we'll continue to close stores either based on lease expiration or as we open full assortment stores in nearby geography. But good growth in terms of store count for International. It is skewed towards the partner-owned businesses because we're moderating our growth at this stage for China, and we're not adding stores in the U.K. But good, strong store base growth for the International business in total, again, roundly between 100 and 120 stores and an ongoing growth in the digital part of that business as well, the online part of that business. So we think a good growth profile overall with an adjustment in growth in China as we learn more about the appropriate store size and format there. But strong growth online in China as well in 2019. In the U.K. right now, the opportunity is to drive more sales through the existing store footprint that we have."

Our thoughts on the intimate apparel category are that it's a great category. I think the one observation reflection I would have on others entering the category is they're doing so because it's an attractive category. It's got the opportunity for differentiation. It inherently -- when it's intimate apparel versus underwear has emotional content. And from that, a lot of economic value can be created for companies, participants in the category. So we think it's a great category. In terms of recent developments, pricing pressure, commoditization, I mean, at the end of the day, it comes back to the merchandise. If the merchandise is special, unique, reflects fashion, has newness, has technical benefit, there are terrific opportunities in the category. So we feel very good about the category. And again, I would characterize the entrance of new participants, frankly, as a sign of that and that it's an attractive category.

And again, that's where John and Amie are spending -- and Greg, the substantial majority of their time as they should, the merchandise and that deep understanding of the customer. With that said, we've -- we have and will continue to review all significant aspects of the Victoria's Secret business, whether that's how we market, how we sell online and in stores, the experience customers have in stores and online, the cost structure of the business, the real estate footprint and format of the business. And we've embarked on detailed review of all those things. Specifically on real estate, our store closure plans are heightened in 2018. And we pulled back on investing in new and remodeling -- new stores and the remodeling of stores substantially over the last several years. But truly, everything is on the table. Amy's been in seat just since October and John's just a couple of weeks in. So you can appreciate that they want to make sure that they have a full appreciation of the situation before they make major changes. But with that said, they're very intensely engaged in the business and again, most focused on the merchandise. But truly, everything is on the table. And for example, we did a deep review of all of our real estate in the fourth quarter, which solidified and gave rise to our plans about capital activity, spending activity in 2019 and again, a more active closure plan for 2019 than we've seen in prior years. But truly, everything is on the table with the dominant focus on the customer and on the merchandise. Thanks."

It's part of L Brands, as you know. I'm sorry, I tend to have a little bit of humor here. But that important part of our business was actually able to reduce promotional activity in 2018 and particularly in the fourth quarter. So what really drives that promotional level in these businesses is the quality of the merchandise and the quality of running the business in a disciplined manner. And when we get that right, compelling, fresh merchandise, promotional levels come down, AURs go up, margins are healthy, inventory turns are strong; and Bath & Body has a strong record of that and had incremental progress in 2018 in terms of reducing promotion. With respect to Victoria's Secret, the mindset or the thinking is the same, which is when you get the merchandise more right than wrong, you're able to reduce promotion. As you can appreciate, substantial change in the assortment will occur more in the back half of 2019 than in the front half of 2019. So we have been more promotional than we would like over the last several years through improvement in the merchandise assortment. With ongoing disciplined management of inventory, we would expect that we'll be able to reduce promotional levels as we move forward. But it's going to take a little bit of time. Hopefully, that answers your questions. Thanks."

Thanks, Kimberly. Thanks for the question. I think the thing that I would add to your framing of what occurred and you're asking for more insight, obviously, is some of our core franchises and particularly Body by Victoria had a deceleration in trend, a year-on-year pressure that's gotten more significant as we moved through 2018, Kimberly. And that pressure in those core franchises, again, not limited to, but principally Body by Victoria, is really what drove the further pressure as we moved through 2018. And what that comes back to is innovation. Everything's got a life cycle. And as one gets later in life cycles, you got to innovate and update and create differentiation. And we got a bit behind on that in some of these core bra franchises. And you can be sure that John and the team there are intensely focused on that very question and that big opportunity, frankly. And that's going to be a big -- is a big priority as we move to 2019.

You asked is this the first wave, and I'd -- I'm saying this was a little bit of intended humor. It's an important subject you're asking about. I actually would assert that this is about our 50th wave. And what I mean by that is we close stores every year. So that's an ongoing part of running the business. How we go about it is we look at current and projected performance, sales, profit, cash flow. We look at trade area dynamics and how store openings and closings affect nearby stores and, to a lesser extent, our online business. And based on those historic and projected results not just for the store in question but for nearby stores, we make judgments about what the projected sales profit cash flow results would be also in relation to what it may cost to exit a store. And based on those criteria, we close stores. And in fact, we close stores every year at Bath & Body Works and at Victoria's. And we also open stores every year. We are closing more stores in -- we did in 2018 and expected in 2019 based on the overall performance of the Victoria's Secret business not meeting our expectations or having year-on-year declines. But that's how we go about it. It's detailed. It's rigorous. It's fact-based. And again, the result is we're closing more stores at Victoria's than we have over the last few years. But again, I wouldn't want you to think that we do it in waves. It's an ongoing part of a good multiunit business. Whether it's a restaurant business or a retail business, it's a good ongoing part of the running of the business. We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate terms. So for those malls that are the most vulnerable malls, we have a lot of opportunity to exit those situations with no -- at no cost or with very little cost. So we've got a lot of flexibility. And on an overall basis, our real estate portfolio is in pretty good shape. Do we have some opportunities? We do. We recognized an impairment cost in our results this year. But on an overall basis, our real estate is in good shape. And that's because it is very actively managed as an ongoing part of the running of the business. With respect to relaunching the Victoria's website, I think that was your question. We have been working on that over the last several years. The project is in good shape. We are currently doing testing of the new online platform, a live testing, and expect to go live broadly on that conversion in probably April. But again, it will be a function of testing, which, at this point, is going well, but likely to do the cutover roundly in the April time frame. And we will have the ability to revert back to the legacy system if we have any challenges as we cutover. But that project's in good shape and will create capability for us -- capabilities for us to do a lot of things that we're very enthused about doing over the next year or 2 in terms of consumer-facing -- customer-facing things that many others do today that -- than we will be able to do.

That's the most important assumption. Separately, you're asking about can Bath & Body lap tough numbers and to what extent. Bath & Body is a very well-led business. It's in a very strong category of retailing in terms of personal care and beauty. And we believe it's reasonable that they can continue their success. Are we expecting the same degree fully, ultimately, in our operating income the same degree of success in '19 in OI dollars as they produced in '18? No, there's a little bit of moderation in the OI dollar results. But we have confidence that, that business can continue to perform well. It's very well led. It's in a very good category of retailing. They've got good current results. So we think we've made reasonable assumptions with respect to Bath & Body Works. It won't be easy by any stretch, but it's a very well-led business and a great category retailing. And the recent results have been very good. The more fundamental assumption is the degree and rate of improvement for Lingerie and PINK. And we've tried to deal with that appropriately.

So Dana, first of all, there are multiple components of the International business as you can appreciate. So in terms of how we think about investment, and I would describe this first through the combination of our own company-owned businesses and then also the franchise and partner-owned businesses, we expect to grow the store count meaningfully in the International business in 2019 roundly opening between company-owned and partner-owned stores between 100 and, say, 120 stores. So that's good growth. We'll also -- as we do in our company-owned business in North America, we'll continue to close stores either based on lease expiration or as we open full assortment stores in nearby geography. But good growth in terms of store count for International. It is skewed towards the partner-owned businesses because we're moderating our growth at this stage for China, and we're not adding stores in the U.K. But good, strong store base growth for the International business in total, again, roundly between 100 and 120 stores and an ongoing growth in the digital part of that business as well, the online part of that business. So we think a good growth profile overall with an adjustment in growth in China as we learn more about the appropriate store size and format there. But strong growth online in China as well in 2019.

He and his team are very capable. And the differential growth opportunity or the hindsight from '18 that's particularly shaping the agenda for 2019 is to really -- to have more success in the pursuit of the prestige business. With that said, I think by last count, we've got 4 of the top 20 fragrances -- perfume fragrance sold, either globally or in the United States. So we're starting from a strong base. And probably most people don't know that we have 4 of the top 20. So it's a good strong business with good margin profile. But in terms of growth opportunity, we see the opportunity to accelerate growth in -- particularly in that part of the business. Thanks."

Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.14 were above our initial guidance of about breakeven, principally driven by a strong performance at Bath & Body Works and some favorability in income taxes.
Performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie, PINK, Victoria's Secret Beauty and International were largely in line with our forecast. Our performance continues to be mixed, substantial growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works and an improvement in the other segments as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henry Mendel was offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. At Bath & Body Works, an aligned experienced leadership team and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments are contributing to another solid year. We also remained highly focused on improving performance in the Victoria's Secret and PINK businesses, [indiscernible] and Amy Hawk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, respectively, are focused on getting closer to our customers and improving our merchandise assortments.

So in terms of where we see strong consumer response, and what we're focused on is where we're delivering significant fashion and elevation in the assortment. And it's a big focus for us, and that's where we're seeing the strongest consumer response. The incredible bra launch did well. But as a general theme, it's where we have fashion that resonates with the consumer. And again, John is particularly focused on that. And jumped right in, frankly, he's been with our business now 13 weeks and hit the ground running in a very good and intense way in the business and he's very busy at work to impact fall assortments.
But again, for Lingerie, it's about delivering compelling fashion in the major categories of bras, panties and sleep and loungewear. In the PINK business, strong performance in intimates and a good volume result in sport bras, particularly and again at the intimate side of the business with very strong value for the consumer, and that business, PINK, is focused on really continuing to advance the assortment in bras and panties and is doing important work to reposition the apparel assortments as well, but has a real advantage in the bra and panties side of the business.
And then for Victoria's Secret Beauty, the -- and this business continues to do well. And where the business had good fashion in a better priced -- higher priced fragrance business, had strong consumer response. So  as has been the case for us for a long, long time, and the same idea applies to Bath & Body Works and in our history, when we're delivering strong fashion, differentiated merchandise with emotional content, the consumer response in a good way, and we get healthy margins, we get unit volume, we get AUR opportunity and we get the results. So that's what the Victoria's leaders John, Amie and Greg are focused on. And frankly, they're the same for the team at Bath & Body Works. When we do it well, we get paid. And when we're off the market -- or off the mark or our assortments get too basic, that's when we tend to have trouble."

We said pretty consistently now for probably roundly 6 or 9 months, certainly 6 months, that everything is on the table with respect to the evaluation of the Victoria's Secret business, and that wasn't just to throw away praise that was [indiscernible] but we are taking a fresh hard look at all aspects of the business. And that's not a onetime exercise, it will be an ongoing exercise, and starts from the place that the ultimate profit result, economic results of the business is not consistent with our expectations or the potential of the business. And thus, you get into a mindset, we're in a mindset of truly looking at everything. And again, not a onetime exercise.
As Amie and John particularly have come into the business, but Greg has done the same thing, it really does start. And it's not limited to, but it starts with fundamentally the merchandise that you're selling. And as I mentioned in a quick comment on the first question of this call, Amie is very intensely focused on understanding that target customer and reworking the assortments at PINK. And John, again now 13 weeks in, has truly hit the ground running and is bringing to our situation a lot of great experience that he had in his prior retail life. And so we're very focused, obviously, on the merchandise. And as registered in our pre-circulated comments, that impact showing up in the most clear way beginning in the fall season, and it will get more significant as we move through the fall season, but that is tangible and real.
From that, we're taking off our look at lots of other stuff. We closed more stores or announced plans to close more stores, have closed more stores, to rightsize square footage in 2019 than we had historically, as an example of taking up a hard fresh look at things.
And by the way, the business also continues to invest in real estate and opens doors where it makes sense, particularly at Bath & Body Works but also internationally. As it relates to marketing, like in the fashion show, at the end of the day, as part of that fresh hard review of everything, we're taking a hard look at the best ways to enforce to equities and the strengths of the Victoria's business and make appropriate adjustments to the positioning of the business. And then in concert with the changes in merchandise, how do we most effectively market those changes? And that work, as you would appreciate, is in process when we have specific things to share publicly, we will. In some cases, we'll do that right as consumers are experiencing it, for competitive reasons that you would understand. But there's active work going on with respect to how the business is marketed, as indicated by our announcement recently about a reevaluation of the fashion show.
So everything is on the table. Certainly, you mentioned international and how we're looking at that business, there are no constraints, only time frame. You would understand in that evaluation, one has to think about lease terms and lease flexibility and those kinds of things, but we're in a position where everything is on the table. Less [indiscernible] has always led with that mindset. It's always about looking forward and about change. And on an overall basis, certainly, he's navigated and led that well over a long, long time in specialty retail, and we're very focused on it as a management team."

On the progression of margin rates and EBIT rates, as we move through the year, while there are puts and takes, including some benefits that we got from our proprietary credit card and some sourcing related benefits that we got last year and into the first quarter this year, despite those puts and takes, we would expect a progression and improvement sequentially in margin rates and the operating income results in the Victoria's business as we move through the year. 
Again, even despite the call outs that we had in the prepared remarks and including the pressure from the list 3 tariff move from 10% to 25%. With respect to buying and occupancy dollar increases or percent growth and sales growth needed to drive leverage, in the Bath & Body business, driven by the ongoing and we think a very healthy and appropriate investment and store remodels and some pressure related to continued makeshift towards direct, again, Bath & Body's having the great outcome of growing sales in stores and online, but online is growing at a faster rate and the P&L architecture that penetration growth for direct in BBW in addition to pressure related to real estate, results in a sales growth to leverage B&O in the high single or low double range, depending upon time period.
Again, driven by the 2 factors I just mentioned, the direct business [indiscernible] is a very healthy profit business for BBW and VS for that matter, but that growth rate outstripping the total growth rate drive some geography change in that P&L. And then for Victoria's, driven by a lack of growth in square footage and our pullback on investment, the breakpoint or the leverage point for sales at VS is flat or even a little less than flat in 2019.

And that new platform will enable us to do a lot of things. Now we need to make further investment to do those things, such as buy online, pickup in store, but another key input to achieving that consumer outcome will be the RFID project that's underway for Victoria's Secret. And it's critical that we have a very good information about our specific inventories, and we have broad assortments at Victoria's, particularly in the bra category, so we want to make sure we had accurate information. And this RFID project I'm mentioning will help enable a buy online, pickup in store project that will likely get after in 2020 after we do the RFID work this year.
We are making further investments in the digital business beyond the platform, including rolling that new platform to the international side of our business and continue to enhance the consumer experience.
And then we are also making significant investment in digital fulfillment capacity for Victoria's. And while outsourced, we're adding a lot of capacity for the Bath & Body side of the business as well given the growth and further potential in that business. So a lot going on, a lot investment is happening related to the online business, which again as you know is now running $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion for L Brands, growing at a very healthy rate on an overall basis and highly profitable."

What's the opportunity if you want to look at more cost cuts? Not necessarily closing stores, but just more efficiencies to overall improve the margin? What might those be? And then also can you just talk about the path to profitability in China? You made some comments in the prepared remarks about that business getting a little bit better. Can you tell us where it stands today? And what you see going forward?"
285544,599266078,1744260,"L Brands, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 23, 2019",2019-05-23,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Yes, with respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again, beyond getting margin rates where they have been. Again, the biggest cause of",558,"Yes, with respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again, beyond getting margin rates where they have been. Again, the biggest cause of decline, profit rate and profit dollar decline at Victoria's, has been erosion of margin rates, merchandise margin rates to be specific. And that's about pricing and promotion and having merchandise with emotional content.
But that wasn't your question, you're asking about the expense side of the business. So moving down to P&L, the biggest variable expense we have is store payroll. And we believe it's important to have appropriate coverage of square footage and traffic volumes to drive the selling opportunity that exists in our stores. We also believe it's important to pay our associates. We have outstanding teams at a competitive level to ensure that we can attract and retain appropriately skilled store associates and we've gotten a lot of them given the selling opportunity in the business.
But so with respect to store payroll, not a lot of opportunity on a rate basis for reduction. With respect to occupancy cost, obviously, the action and that one can take or 2 major things that one can do beyond driving sales volume, one is to adjust investment and remodel activity or new stores, and we've done that. We've dramatically reduced almost to 0 the investment levels at Victoria's Secret, given the current state of performance.
And as leases roll off or where there's opportunity to close doors, and again, we closed more stores this year than we had probably a factor of between 2 and 3x we've done previously, so that's the other action that one can take. And then there are other 2 big categories of expense to consider, and we have, one is the marketing investment in the business to drive sales. Generally people invest in marketing because they believe it does drive top line growth, which is obviously important to any business.
But we have heavily scrutinized the marketing spend at Victoria's. And over the last 9 to 12 months, particularly we've taken meaningful dollars out of the marketing spend at Victoria's. And then lastly, is the home office spending in the business. And in connection with all the changes that were made in the business, in 2016, the business let go in round numbers about 300 people, and made a substantial reduction on home office workforce at that time. And we've tried to manage any growth since that time. 
But all the expenses are being evaluated, they have been evaluated and we've taken significant action on those expenses at Victoria's. But the biggest opportunity is about top line growth at a healthy margin rate and then we would get reasonable leverage on the expense lines.
With respect to China, in terms of improving the profitability there, it will be volume in existing stores, volume related to new store activity, which we have planned in 2019 and then a continued focus on, consistent with your earlier question, a continued focus on the expense levels in that business to make sure that we're getting appropriate return on the various forms of expense structure in the China business. But it is largely a volume story in China to get to the profit we expect. Thanks."

As I mentioned in an earlier comment, we believe we have our greatest competitive advantage and strong attributes around customer consumer loyalty in the intimate apparel business, and so it's our intention, Amie's intention, Les' intention, the team's intention to grow the intimate business faster than the apparel business. So I would expect that, that mix of about 50-50 will SKU to intimates being obviously greater than 50% over the next year or 2. That's our focus for the reasons I mentioned.
With respect to the apparel part of the business, and Amie will comment on all of this on September 10 when we have our time together. She's relooking at all of it in terms of price points, good, better, best opportunities, fabric and fabrication, surface design, various logo treatments, et cetera, she's looking at all of it, testing a lot of things, seeing some positive consumer reaction to some of the things that have been tested. And as we've mentioned consistently and Kimberly, you're familiar with one of the additional advantages that PINK has and its operating model, its business model, our short lead times and a mindset around speed and agility, so they are chasing hard.
I'm not going to sit here and tell you that she's got all the answers because she doesn't, but she's working and seeing -- working very actively and applying the BBW and other retail playbook to this business. And we're encouraged, based on what we're seeing, but the results of her work will show up most in the fall season. You know that we've got campus reps that we have very active dialogue with, and she's certainly making good use of that resource in ensuring that and that resource is truly telling us what we need to hear, and I think they are.

We believe that there is a very significant opportunity with respect to fashion, with respect to an elevation of the merchandise, with respect to not selling as much what we would call commodity or commonly available merchandise in the bra, panty and sleep and loungewear categories.
And based on early work but substantial work, John is on it and has a very strong point of view that makes a lot of intuitive sense. We've done a lot of consumer research over the years, as you would expect us to. It's inherent in running a business. And certainly, the attributes around comfort and other things that you mentioned in your report, we understand well. And I believe that we have leadership positions in many of those attributes or those characteristics that consumers are looking for.
But John is on it. He brings good experience. His team is on it with him, he's leading. He's got a clear point of view, and substantial changes to the assortment are coming. You'll see that beginning in August. John will be with investors with the balance of the team on September 10 to more fully articulate his assessment and his game plan.

And I realized there's chatter out there with commentary about the good, better, best pricing.

One, they've got strong growth at healthy margins in all of their major books of business. So that's really good. The metaphor of firing on all cylinders, they are, in terms of the home fragrance business, the hand soap business and the body care business. So that's got them excited.
What leads to that is the regular introduction of newness and fashion in those categories. If we take some examples, recent examples, the launch of gingham in their body care business and fragrance categories has -- had a very strong positive consumer response. It's sophisticated, it's elevated and their customer and new customers both have responded very well to it.
So what's got them excited is they're not -- they don't back 100%, they don't get it right every time, but their major books of business are performing well and where they've introduced compelling new fashion and newness in their key items, key categories, they've got an a strong consumer response, so that's got them excited. And they leverage a very fast supply chain to manage the risk of that. They do a good job of it.
With respect to inventory, and we commented about inventories, some inventory investment at Bath & Body Works. Obviously, the top line trend in the business is very good. But we missed some business in 2018 because we got very lean on inventory. And so the last thing you want to do is literally not be able to fulfill your sales potential because you got to lean. So learning from that and doing it in a balanced way, we're making a little more investment ahead of key holiday periods to ensure that we've got the appropriate in-stock positions to maximize the business. So that's what's going on.
That team has managed inventory in an extraordinary way over the last 10 years, improving turn to beyond 4x a year and driving strong sales and margin result, consumer experience as part of that. And so our confidence level, and that team are working with our vendor partners to manage the supply chain, inventory flow, all of that, is very, very high based on a lot of strong results over the years. So not concerned about it. Thank you."

Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.14 were above our initial guidance of about breakeven, principally driven by a strong performance at Bath & Body Works and some favorability in income taxes.
Performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie, PINK, Victoria's Secret Beauty and International were largely in line with our forecast. Our performance continues to be mixed. Substantial growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works and an improvement in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. At Bath & Body Works, an aligned experienced leadership team and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments are contributing to another solid year. We also remain highly focused on improving performance in the Victoria's Secret and PINK businesses. John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, respectively, are focused on getting closer to our customers and improving our merchandise assortments. We look forward to our assortments benefiting from their input beginning in the fall season, and our earnings guidance assumes gradual improvement in the Victoria's Secret segment performance as we move through the remainder of 2019. You will hear more from John and Amy as well as other business leaders at our Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 10.

So in terms of where we see strong consumer response and what we're focused on is where we're delivering significant fashion and elevation in the assortment. And it's a big focus for us, and that's where we're seeing the strongest consumer response. The incredible bra launch did well. But as a general theme, it's where we have fashion that resonates with the consumer. And again, John is particularly focused on that and jumped right in. Frankly, he's been with our business now 13 weeks and hit the ground running in a very good and intense way in the business and is very busy at work to impact fall assortments. But again, for Lingerie, it's about delivering compelling fashion in the major categories of bras, panties and sleep and loungewear. 
In the PINK business, strong performance in intimates and a good volume result in sport bras, particularly and in -- again the intimate side of the business with very strong value for the consumer. And that business, PINK, is focused on really continuing to advance the assortment in bras and panties and is doing important work to reposition the apparel assortments as well, but has a real advantage in the bra and panties side of the business.
And then for Victoria's Secret Beauty, the -- this business continues to do well. And where the business had good fashion in a better priced -- or higher-priced fragrance business, we've had strong consumer response. So as has been the case for us for a long, long time, and the same idea applies to Bath & Body Works and in our history, when we're delivering strong fashion, differentiated merchandise with emotional content, the consumer responds in a good way and we get healthy margins, we get unit volume, we get AUR opportunity and we get the results. So that's what the Victoria's leaders, John, Amy and Greg, are focused on. And frankly, the same for the team at Bath & Body Works. When we do it well, we get paid. And when we're off the market -- or off the mark or our assortments get too basic, that's when we tend to have trouble."

So thanks, Ike, for the question and your research on the business.

That was
[Audio Gap]
we are taking a fresh hard look at all aspects of the business. And that's not a onetime exercise. It will be an ongoing exercise and starts from the place that the ultimate profit result, economic results of the business is not consistent with our expectations or the potential of the business. And thus, you get into a mindset -- we're in a mindset of truly looking at everything. And again, not a onetime exercise.
As Amy and John particularly have come into the business, but Greg has done the same thing, it really does start. And it's not limited to, but it starts with fundamentally the merchandise that you're selling. And as I mentioned in a quick comment on the first question on this call, Amy is very intensely focused on understanding that target customer and reworking the assortments at PINK. And John, again now 13 weeks in, has truly hit the ground running and is bringing to our situation a lot of great experience that he had in his prior retail life. And so we're very focused, obviously, on the merchandise. And as registered in our pre-circulated comments, that impact is showing up in the most clear way beginning in the fall season, and it will get more significant as we move through the fall season. But that is tangible and real.
From that, we're taking our look at lots of other stuff. We closed more stores or announced plans to close more stores, have closed more stores, to rightsize square footage in 2019 than we had historically, as an example of taking up a hard fresh look at things. And by the way, the business also continues to invest in real estate and opens doors where it makes sense, particularly at Bath & Body Works, but also internationally. 
As it relates to marketing, Ike, in the fashion show, at the end of the day, as part of that fresh hard review of everything, we're taking a hard look at the best ways to reinforce the equities and the strengths of the Victoria's business and make appropriate adjustment to the positioning of the business. And then in concert with the changes in merchandise, how do we most effectively market those changes? And that work, as you would appreciate, is in process. When we have specific things to share publicly, we will. In some cases, we'll do that right as consumers are experiencing it for competitive reasons that you would understand. But there's active work going on with respect to how the business is marketed, as indicated by our announcement recently about a reevaluation of the fashion show.
So everything is on the table. Certainly, you mentioned international and how we're looking at that business. There are no constraints, only time frame. You would understand in that evaluation, one has to think about lease terms and lease flexibility and those kinds of things, but we're in a position where everything is on the table. Les Wexner has always led with that mindset, that it's always about looking forward and about change. And on an overall basis, certainly, he's navigated and led that well over a long, long time in specialty retail, and we're very focused on it as a management team."

But as we lap some of those other benefits, and then it sound like maybe we're baking in some incremental tariff headwinds, just how should we think about the EBIT margin rate progression through the year for Victoria's Secret relative to that 300 basis point decline in Q1? And then kind of as a follow-up, clearly, some greater divergence this year with the investment plans at Victoria's Secret versus BBW. I was hoping you could just help us understand the run rate of buying and occupancy growth at each of these concepts so we can have a better understanding of the leverage points today."

So thanks, Mark. On the progression of margin rates and EBIT rates as we move through the year, while there are puts and takes, including some benefit that we got from our proprietary credit card and some sourcing-related benefits that we got last year and into the first quarter of this year, despite those puts and takes, we would expect a progression and improvement sequentially in margin rates and the operating income result in the Victoria's business as we move through the year. Again, even despite the callouts that we had in the prepared remarks and including the pressure from the list 3 tariff moved from 10% to 25%. 
With respect to buying and occupancy dollar increases or percent growth and sales growth needed to drive leverage, in the Bath & Body business, driven by the ongoing and we think a very healthy and appropriate investment and store remodels and some pressure related to continued mix shift towards direct, again, Bath & Body is having the great outcome of growing sales in stores and online, but online is growing at a faster rate. And the P&L architecture, that penetration growth for direct in BBW in addition to the pressure related to real estate, results in a sales growth to leverage B&O in the high single or low double range, depending upon time period, again, driven by the 2 factors I just mentioned, the direct business as an aside is a very healthy profit business for BBW and VS for that matter. But that growth rate outstripping the total growth rate drives some geography change in that P&L. 
And then for Victoria's, driven by the lack of growth in square footage and our pullback on investment, the breakpoint or the leverage point for sales at VS is flat or even a little less than flat in 2019. Thanks."

And I'm knocking on wood or a hard surface anyway, but it is up and running. And there hasn't been any significant adverse set of startup issues related to that, and that's a big deal.
And that new platform will enable us to do a lot of things. Now we need to make further investment to do those things, such as buy online, pickup in store. But another key input to achieving that consumer outcome will be the RFID project that's underway for Victoria's Secret. And it's critical that we have a very good information about our specific inventories. And we have broad assortments at Victoria's, particularly in the bra category, and so we want to make sure that we have accurate information. And this RFID project I'm mentioning will help enable a buy online, pickup in store project that we'll likely get after in 2020 after we do the RFID work this year.
We are making further investments in the digital business beyond the platform, including rolling that new platform to the international side of our business and continuing to enhance the consumer experience.
And then we are also making a significant investment in digital fulfillment capacity for Victoria's. And while outsourced, we're adding a lot of capacity for the Bath & Body side of the business as well given the growth and further potential in that business. So a lot going on, a lot of investment happening related to the online business, which again, as you know, is now running $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion for L Brands, growing at a very healthy rate on an overall basis and highly profitable."

From a big picture perspective, the company has done a great job cutting costs. You mentioned La Senza, Henri Bendel. But Victoria's Secret North America is still doing over $7 billion in sales like -- but obviously the margins have come down. What's the opportunity if you wanted to look at more cost cuts?

You made some comments in the prepared remarks about that business getting a little bit better. Can you just tell us where it stands today and what you see going forward?"

So With respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again, beyond getting margin rates where they had been. Again, the biggest cause",568,"Yes. So With respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again, beyond getting margin rates where they had been. Again, the biggest cause of decline, profit rate and profit dollar decline, at Victoria's has been erosion of margin rates, merchandise margin rates to be specific. And that's about pricing and promotion and having merchandise with emotional content. But that wasn't your question. You're asking about the expense side of the business. 
So moving down the P&L, the biggest variable expense we have is store payroll. And we believe that it's important to have appropriate coverage of square footage and of traffic volumes to drive the selling opportunity that exists in our stores. We also believe it's important to pay our associates. We have outstanding teams at a competitive level to ensure that we can attract and retain appropriately skilled store associates, and we got a lot of them given the selling opportunity in the business. But -- so with respect to store payroll, not a lot of opportunity on a rate basis for a reduction. 
With respect to occupancy cost, obviously, the action that one can take, there are 2 major things that one can do beyond driving sales volume. One is to adjust investment and remodel activity or new stores, and we've done that. We've dramatically reduced almost to 0 the investment levels at Victoria's Secret given the current state of performance.
And as leases roll off or where there's opportunity to close doors, and again, we closed more stores this year than we had probably a factor of between 2 and 3x we had done previously, so that's the other action that one can take. And then there are other -- 2 other big categories of expense to consider, and we have. One is the marketing investment in the business to drive sales. Generally, people invest in marketing because they believe it does drive top line growth, which is obviously important to any business.
But we have heavily scrutinized the marketing spend at Victoria's. And over the last 9 to 12 months, particularly, we've taken meaningful dollars out of the marketing spend at Victoria's. 
And then lastly is the home office spending in the business. And in connection with all the changes that were made in the business, in 2016, the business let go in round numbers about 300 people and made a substantial reduction in the home office workforce at that time. And we've tried to manage any growth since that time. But all the expenses are being evaluated. They have been evaluated, and we've taken significant action on those expenses at Victoria's. But the biggest opportunity is about top line growth at a healthy margin rate, and then we would get reasonable leverage on the expense lines.
With respect to China, in terms of improving the profitability there, it will be volume in existing stores; volume related to new store activity, which we have planned in 2019; and then a continued focus on -- consistent with your earlier question, a continued focus on the expense levels in that business to make sure that we're getting appropriate return on the various forms of expense structure in the China business. But it is largely a volume story in China to get to the profit we expect. Thanks."

At present, it's about 50-50. So bras and panties together, about 50%. And the balance of the business, largely apparel, about 50%. 
As I mentioned in an earlier comment, we believe we have our greatest competitive advantage and strong attributes around customer or consumer loyalty in the intimate apparel business. And so it's our intention, Amy's intention, Les' intention, the team's intention, to grow the intimate business faster than the apparel business. So I would expect that, that mix of about 50-50 will skew to intimates being obviously greater than 50% over the next year or 2. That's our focus for the reasons I mentioned.
With respect to the apparel part of the business, and Amy will comment on all of this on September 10 when we have our time together, she's relooking at all of it in terms of price points, good, better, best opportunities, fabric and fabrication, surface design, various logo treatments, et cetera. She's looking at all of it, testing a lot of things, seeing some positive consumer reaction to some of the things that have been tested. And as we've mentioned consistently -- and Kimberly, you're familiar with one of the additional advantages that PINK has in its operating model, its business model, our short lead times and a mindset around speed and agility, so they are chasing hard. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that she's got all the answers because she doesn't. But she's working and seeing some -- working very actively and applying the BBW and other retail playbook to this business. And we're encouraged based on what we're seeing, but the results of her work will show up most in the fall season. You know that we've got campus reps that we have very active dialogue with, and she's certainly making good use of that resource in ensuring that, that resource is truly telling us what we need to hear, and I think they are. So a lot going on.
And we're optimistic that, certainly, as we move through the year and particularly in the fall season, that we'll stabilize and then get back to positive growth in sales and margin in PINK."

The first thing I would say is that the subjects that you researched and wrote about are -- is what John and his team are most focused on, which is how to evolve the assortment to ensure that the merchandise offering best addresses her needs. As you know, from all the consumer work you do, sometimes she's able to clearly express what she's looking for. And there other times, where a leading consumer brand, and we have our examples of this, is able to drive the market through our own innovation. And again, that's what you're asking about.
We believe that there is a very significant opportunity with respect to fashion, with respect to an elevation of the merchandise, with respect to not selling as much, what we would call, commodity or commonly available merchandise in the bra, panty and sleep and loungewear categories. And based on early work but substantial work, John is on it and has a very strong point of view that makes a lot of intuitive sense. 
We've done a lot of consumer research over the years, as you would expect us to. It's inherent in running a business. And certainly, the attributes around comfort and other things that you mentioned in your report, we understand well and believe that we have leadership positions in many of those attributes or those characteristics that consumers are looking for.
But John is on it. He brings good experience. His team is on it with him. He's leading. He's got a clear point of view, and substantial changes to the assortment are coming. You'll see that beginning in August. John will be with investors with the balance of the team on the 10th of September to more fully articulate his assessment and his game plan. And we've got strong reasons for optimism about the progression in 2019 for the Lingerie business. Thank you, Oliver."

The financial outcome to date and expected for the balance of the season is in line with our expectations, so it's doing well and meeting our expectation.
It's not having a material impact on the overall business because it was a reentry and a test. What we have learned, despite what may be out there on the Internet, is that there has been strong positive reaction to the assortment generally, including at higher price points. And I realized there's chatter out there with commentary about the good, better, best pricing. But what I'm conveying in response to your question is we've had a strong positive reaction to all of the price points we have offered in a good way.
Certainly, there's some learning that we're achieving through the test. But again, overall, it's gone well, it's meeting our expectations. The business will get substantially larger a year from now. It remains focused as an online business, but one of the very positive aspects of the test has been the positive consumer response to the swim offering at higher price points, in addition to the more moderate price points that we had historically been in. So that's where we stand on it, and we're encouraged about the test and will be expanding our business there over the next several years. Thank you."

But that's not what our company has done for more than 55 years. We're about fashion. And when we lack fashion, lack newness, lack innovation, where it's not interesting, the result becomes apparent. 
And so in answer to your question about is John focused on that or what's his assessment, again, he'll, for himself, articulate all that in early September. But our observation, his observation is that there is a substantial opportunity to remix the assortment, and that's not just words on a PowerPoint chart or my comment on an earnings call. He's doing real work on that with the team, and it's substantial work. And he's working with our sourcing partners and our vendor partners, which we have strong relationship and good capability. And there's a lot happening.
Will it all be perfect and all work right out of the box? I'm sure it won't. But he's making substantial change. We believe it's positive change that makes sense. And that -- the specifics of that will become apparent as we move through the fall season. And again, he'll share his thinking in September with you and the investment community.

With respect to the potential for additional or different third-party brands in the swim business, absolutely.

One, they've got strong growth at healthy margins in all of their major books of business. So that's really good. The metaphor of firing on all cylinders, they are in terms of the home fragrance business, the hand soap business and the body care business. So that's got them excited.
What leads to that is the regular introduction of newness and fashion in those categories. If we take some examples, recent examples, the launch of gingham in their body care business and fragrance categories has -- had a very strong positive consumer response. It's sophisticated, it's elevated and their customer and new customers both have responded very well to it.
So what's got them excited is -- and they don't -- they're not -- they don't bat 1,000%. They don't get it right every time, but their major books of business are performing well. And where they've introduced compelling new fashion and newness in their key items, key categories, they've gotten a strong consumer response, so that's got them excited. And they leveraged a very fast supply chain to manage the risk of that. They do a good job of it.
With respect to inventory, and we commented about inventories, some inventory investment at Bath & Body Works. Obviously, the top line trend in the business is very good. But we missed some business in 2018 because we got very lean on inventory. And so the last thing you want to do is literally not be able to fulfill your sales potential because you got too lean. So learning from that and doing it in a balanced way, we're making a little bit more investment ahead of key holiday periods to ensure that we've got the appropriate in-stock positions to maximize the business. So that's what's going on.
That team has managed inventory in an extraordinary way over the last 10 years, improving turn to beyond 4x a year and driving strong sales and margin result, consumer experience as part of that. And so our confidence level, and that team working with our vendor partners to manage the supply chain, inventory flow, all of that, is very, very high based on a lot of strong results over the years. So not concerned about it. Thank you."

          Performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie, PINK, Victoria's Secret Beauty and International were largely in line with our forecast. Our performance continues to be mixed. Substantial growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works and an improvement in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret.
          
          Turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. At Bath & Body Works, an aligned experienced leadership team and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments are contributing to another solid year. We also remain highly focused on improving performance in the Victoria's Secret and PINK businesses.

But again, for Lingerie, it's about delivering compelling fashion in the major categories of bras, panties and sleep and loungewear. 
          
          In the PINK business, strong performance in intimates and a good volume result in sport bras, particularly and in -- again the intimate side of the business with very strong value for the consumer. And that business, PINK, is focused on really continuing to advance the assortment in bras and panties and is doing important work to reposition the apparel assortments as well, but has a real advantage in the bra and panties side of the business.
          
          And then for Victoria's Secret Beauty, the -- this business continues to do well. And where the business had good fashion in a better priced -- or higher-priced fragrance business, we've had strong consumer response. So as has been the case for us for a long, long time, and the same idea applies to Bath & Body Works and in our history, when we're delivering strong fashion, differentiated merchandise with emotional content, the consumer responds in a good way and we get healthy margins, we get unit volume, we get AUR opportunity and we get the results. So that's what the Victoria's leaders, John, Amy and Greg, are focused on. And frankly, the same for the team at Bath & Body Works. When we do it well, we get paid. And when we're off the market -- or off the mark or our assortments get too basic, that's when we tend to have trouble."

So thanks, Ike, for the question and your research on the business. We've said pretty consistently now for probably around like 6 or 9 months, certainly 6 months, that everything is on the table with respect to the evaluation of the Victoria's Secret",599,"Yes. So thanks, Ike, for the question and your research on the business. We've said pretty consistently now for probably around like 6 or 9 months, certainly 6 months, that everything is on the table with respect to the evaluation of the Victoria's Secret business, and that wasn't just a throw away phrase. That was
          
          [Audio Gap]
          
          we are taking a fresh hard look at all aspects of the business. And that's not a onetime exercise. It will be an ongoing exercise and starts from the place that the ultimate profit result, economic results of the business is not consistent with our expectations or the potential of the business. And thus, you get into a mindset -- we're in a mindset of truly looking at everything. And again, not a onetime exercise.
          
          As Amy and John particularly have come into the business, but Greg has done the same thing, it really does start. And it's not limited to, but it starts with fundamentally the merchandise that you're selling. And as I mentioned in a quick comment on the first question on this call, Amy is very intensely focused on understanding that target customer and reworking the assortments at PINK. And John, again now 13 weeks in, has truly hit the ground running and is bringing to our situation a lot of great experience that he had in his prior retail life. And so we're very focused, obviously, on the merchandise. And as registered in our pre-circulated comments, that impact is showing up in the most clear way beginning in the fall season, and it will get more significant as we move through the fall season. But that is tangible and real.
          
          From that, we're taking our look at lots of other stuff. We closed more stores or announced plans to close more stores, have closed more stores, to rightsize square footage in 2019 than we had historically, as an example of taking up a hard fresh look at things. And by the way, the business also continues to invest in real estate and opens doors where it makes sense, particularly at Bath & Body Works, but also internationally. 
          
          As it relates to marketing, Ike, in the fashion show, at the end of the day, as part of that fresh hard review of everything, we're taking a hard look at the best ways to reinforce the equities and the strengths of the Victoria's business and make appropriate adjustment to the positioning of the business. And then in concert with the changes in merchandise, how do we most effectively market those changes? And that work, as you would appreciate, is in process. When we have specific things to share publicly, we will. In some cases, we'll do that right as consumers are experiencing it for competitive reasons that you would understand. But there's active work going on with respect to how the business is marketed, as indicated by our announcement recently about a reevaluation of the fashion show.
          
          So everything is on the table. Certainly, you mentioned international and how we're looking at that business. There are no constraints, only time frame. You would understand in that evaluation, one has to think about lease terms and lease flexibility and those kinds of things, but we're in a position where everything is on the table. Les Wexner has always led with that mindset, that it's always about looking forward and about change. And on an overall basis, certainly, he's navigated and led that well over a long, long time in specialty retail, and we're very focused on it as a management team."

You mentioned you would expect merchandise margin to improve throughout the year. But as we lap some of those other benefits, and then it sounds like maybe we're baking in some incremental tariff headwinds, just how should we think about the EBIT margin rate progression through the year for Victoria's Secret relative to that 300 basis point decline in Q1? And then kind of as a follow-up, clearly some greater divergence this year with the investment plans at Victoria's Secret versus BBW. I was hoping you could just help us understand the run rate of buying and occupancy growth at each of these concepts so we can have a better understanding of the leverage points today."

So thanks, Mark. On the progression of margin rates and EBIT rates as we move through the year, while there are puts and takes, including some benefit that we got from our proprietary credit card and some sourcing-related benefits that we got last year and into the first quarter of this year, despite those puts and takes, we would expect a progression and improvement sequentially in margin rates and the operating income result in the Victoria's business as we move through the year. Again, even despite the callouts that we had in the prepared remarks and including the pressure from the list 3 tariff moved from 10% to 25%. 
          
          With respect to buying and occupancy dollar increases or percent growth and sales growth needed to drive leverage, in the Bath & Body business, driven by the ongoing and we think a very healthy and appropriate investment in store remodels and some pressure related to continued mix shift towards direct, again, Bath & Body is having the great outcome of growing sales in stores and online, but online is growing at a faster rate. And the P&L architecture, that penetration growth for direct in BBW in addition to the pressure related to real estate, results in a sales growth to leverage B&O in the high single or low double range, depending upon time period, again, driven by the 2 factors I just mentioned, the direct business as an aside is a very healthy profit business for BBW and VS for that matter. But that growth rate outstripping the total growth rate drives some geography change in that P&L. 
          
          And then for Victoria's, driven by the lack of growth in square footage and our pullback on investment, the breakpoint or the leverage point for sales at VS is flat or even a little less than flat in 2019. Thanks."

          And that new platform will enable us to do a lot of things. Now we need to make further investment to do those things, such as buy online, pickup in store. But another key input to achieving that consumer outcome will be the RFID project that's underway for Victoria's Secret. And it's critical that we have a very good information about our specific inventories. And we have broad assortments at Victoria's, particularly in the bra category, and so we want to make sure that we have accurate information. And this RFID project I'm mentioning will help enable a buy online, pickup in store project that we'll likely get after in 2020 after we do the RFID work this year.
          
          We are making further investments in the digital business beyond the platform, including rolling that new platform to the international side of our business and continuing to enhance the consumer experience.
          
          And then we are also making a significant investment in digital fulfillment capacity for Victoria's. And while outsourced, we're adding a lot of capacity for the Bath & Body side of the business as well given the growth and further potential in that business.

From a big picture perspective, the company has done a great job cutting costs. You mentioned La Senza, Henri Bendel. But Victoria's Secret North America is still doing over $7 billion in sales like -- but obviously the margins have come down. What's the opportunity if you wanted to look at more cost cuts? Not necessarily closing stores, but just more efficiencies to overall improve the margin, what might those be? And then also, can you just talk about the path to profitability in China?

So With respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again, beyond getting margin rates where they had been. Again, the biggest cause",568,"Yes. So With respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again, beyond getting margin rates where they had been. Again, the biggest cause of decline, profit rate and profit dollar decline, at Victoria's has been erosion of margin rates, merchandise margin rates to be specific. And that's about pricing and promotion and having merchandise with emotional content. But that wasn't your question. You're asking about the expense side of the business. 
          
          So moving down the P&L, the biggest variable expense we have is store payroll. And we believe that it's important to have appropriate coverage of square footage and of traffic volumes to drive the selling opportunity that exists in our stores. We also believe it's important to pay our associates. We have outstanding teams at a competitive level to ensure that we can attract and retain appropriately skilled store associates, and we got a lot of them given the selling opportunity in the business. But -- so with respect to store payroll, not a lot of opportunity on a rate basis for a reduction. 
          
          With respect to occupancy cost, obviously, the action that one can take, there are 2 major things that one can do beyond driving sales volume. One is to adjust investment in remodel activity or new stores, and we've done that. We've dramatically reduced almost to 0 the investment levels at Victoria's Secret given the current state of performance.
          
          And as leases roll off or where there's opportunity to close stores, and again, we closed more stores this year than we had probably a factor of between 2 and 3x we had done previously, so that's the other action that one can take. And then there are other -- 2 other big categories of expense to consider, and we have. One is the marketing investment in the business to drive sales. Generally, people invest in marketing because they believe it does drive top line growth, which is obviously important to any business.
          
          But we have heavily scrutinized the marketing spend at Victoria's. And over the last 9 to 12 months, particularly, we've taken meaningful dollars out of the marketing spend at Victoria's. 
          
          And then lastly is the home office spending in the business. And in connection with all the changes that were made in the business, in 2016, the business let go in round numbers about 300 people and made a substantial reduction in the home office workforce at that time. And we've tried to manage any growth since that time. But all the expenses are being evaluated. They have been evaluated, and we've taken significant action on those expenses at Victoria's. But the biggest opportunity is about top line growth at a healthy margin rate, and then we would get reasonable leverage on the expense lines.
          
          With respect to China, in terms of improving the profitability there, it will be volume in existing stores; volume related to new store activity, which we have planned in 2019; and then a continued focus on -- consistent with your earlier question, a continued focus on the expense levels in that business to make sure that we're getting appropriate return on the various forms of expense structure in the China business. But it is largely a volume story in China to get to the profit we expect. Thanks."

And so it's our intention, Amy's intention, Les' intention, the team's intention, to grow the intimate business faster than the apparel business. So I would expect that, that mix of about 50-50 will skew to intimates being obviously greater than 50% over the next year or 2. That's our focus for the reasons I mentioned.
          
          With respect to the apparel part of the business, and Amy will comment on all of this on September 10 when we have our time together, she's relooking at all of it in terms of price points, good, better, best opportunities, fabric and fabrication, surface design, various logo treatments, et cetera. She's looking at all of it, testing a lot of things, seeing some positive consumer reaction to some of the things that have been tested.

You know that we've got campus reps that we have very active dialogue with, and she's certainly making good use of that resource and ensuring that, that resource is truly telling us what we need to hear, and I think they are. So a lot going on.

And based on early work but substantial work, John is on it and has a very strong point of view that makes a lot of intuitive sense. 
          
          We've done a lot of consumer research over the years, as you would expect us to. It's inherent in running a business. And certainly, the attributes around comfort and other things that you mentioned in your report, we understand well and believe that we have leadership positions in many of those attributes or those characteristics that consumers are looking for.
          
          But John is on it. He brings good experience. His team is on it with him. He's leading. He's got a clear point of view, and substantial changes to the assortment are coming. You'll see that beginning in August. John will be with investors with the balance of the team on the 10th of September to more fully articulate his assessment and his game plan. And we've got strong reasons for optimism about the progression in 2019 for the Lingerie business. Thank you, Oliver."

          It's not having a material impact on the overall business because it was a reentry and a test. What we have learned, despite what may be out there on the Internet, is that there has been strong positive reaction to the assortment generally, including at higher price points. And I realized there's chatter out there with commentary about the good, better, best pricing. But what I'm conveying in response to your question is we've had a strong positive reaction to all of the price points we have offered in a good way.
          
          Certainly, there's some learning that we're achieving through the test. But again, overall, it's gone well, it's meeting our expectations. The business will get substantially larger a year from now. It remains focused as an online business, but one of the very positive aspects of the test has been the positive consumer response to the swim offering at higher price points, in addition to the more moderate price points that we had historically been in. So that's where we stand on it, and we're encouraged about the test and will be expanding our business there over the next several years. Thank you."

And when we lack fashion, lack newness, lack innovation, where it's not interesting, the result becomes apparent. 
          
          And so in answer to your question about is John focused on that or what's his assessment, again, he'll, for himself, articulate all that in early September. But our observation, his observation is that there is a substantial opportunity to remix the assortment, and that's not just words on a PowerPoint chart or my comment on an earnings call. He's doing real work on that with the team, and it's substantial work. And he's working with our sourcing partners and our vendor partners, which we have strong relationship and good capability. And there's a lot happening.
          
          Will it all be perfect and all work right out of the box? I'm sure it won't. But he's making substantial change. We believe it's positive change that makes sense.

          With respect to the potential for additional or different third-party brands in the swim business, absolutely.

But we'll continue to look at our offering in swim, including the offerings from various third-party brands.

One, they've got strong growth at healthy margins in all of their major books of business. So that's really good. The metaphor of firing on all cylinders, they are in terms of the home fragrance business, the hand soap business and the body care business. So that's got them excited.
          
          What leads to that is the regular introduction of newness and fashion in those categories. If we take some examples, recent examples, the launch of gingham in their body care business and fragrance categories has -- had a very strong positive consumer response. It's sophisticated, it's elevated and their customer and new customers both have responded very well to it.
          
          So what's got them excited is -- and they don't -- they're not -- they don't bat 1,000%. They don't get it right every time, but their major books of business are performing well. And where they've introduced compelling new fashion and newness in their key items, key categories, they've gotten a strong consumer response, so that's got them excited. And they leveraged a very fast supply chain to manage the risk of that. They do a good job of it.
          
          With respect to inventory, and we commented about inventories, some inventory investment at Bath & Body Works. Obviously, the top line trend in the business is very good. But we missed some business in 2018 because we got very lean on inventory. And so the last thing you want to do is literally not be able to fulfill your sales potential because you got too lean. So learning from that and doing it in a balanced way, we're making a little bit more investment ahead of key holiday periods to ensure that we've got the appropriate in-stock positions to maximize the business. So that's what's going on.
          
          That team has managed inventory in an extraordinary way over the last 10 years, improving turn to beyond 4x a year and driving strong sales and margin result, consumer experience as part of that. And so our confidence level in that team working with our vendor partners to manage the supply chain, inventory flow, all of that, is very, very high based on a lot of strong results over the years. So not concerned about it. Thank you."

Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.14 were above our initial guidance of about breakeven, principally driven by a strong performance at Bath & Body Works and some favorability in income taxes.
Performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie, PINK, Victoria's Secret Beauty and International were largely in line with our forecast. Our performance continues to be mixed. Substantial growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works and an improvement in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. At Bath & Body Works, an aligned experienced leadership team and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments are contributing to another solid year. We also remain highly focused on improving performance in the Victoria's Secret and PINK businesses. John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, respectively, are focused on getting closer to our customers and improving our merchandise assortments. We look forward to our assortments benefiting from their input beginning in the fall season, and our earnings guidance assumes gradual improvement in the Victoria's Secret segment performance as we move through the remainder of 2019.

So in terms of where we see strong consumer response and what we're focused on is where we're delivering significant fashion and elevation in the assortment. And it's a big focus for us, and that's where we're seeing the strongest consumer response. The incredible bra launch did well. But as a general theme, it's where we have fashion that resonates with the consumer. And again, John is particularly focused on that and jumped right in. Frankly, he's been with our business now 13 weeks and hit the ground running in a very good and intense way in the business and is very busy at work to impact fall assortments. But again, for Lingerie, it's about delivering compelling fashion in the major categories of bras, panties and sleep and loungewear. 
In the PINK business, strong performance in intimates and a good volume result in sport bras, particularly and in -- again the intimate side of the business with very strong value for the consumer. And that business, PINK, is focused on really continuing to advance the assortment in bras and panties and is doing important work to reposition the apparel assortments as well, but has a real advantage in the bra and panties side of the business.
And then for Victoria's Secret Beauty, the -- this business continues to do well. And where the business had good fashion in a better priced -- or higher-priced fragrance business, we've had strong consumer response. So as has been the case for us for a long, long time, and the same idea applies to Bath & Body Works and in our history, when we're delivering strong fashion, differentiated merchandise with emotional content, the consumer responds in a good way and we get healthy margins, we get unit volume, we get AUR opportunity and we get the results. So that's what the Victoria's leaders, John, Amy and Greg, are focused on. And frankly, the same for the team at Bath & Body Works. When we do it well, we get paid. And when we're off the market -- or off the mark or our assortments get too basic, that's when we tend to have trouble."

That was
[Audio Gap]
we are taking a fresh hard look at all aspects of the business. And that's not a onetime exercise. It will be an ongoing exercise and starts from the place that the ultimate profit result, economic results of the business is not consistent with our expectations or the potential of the business. And thus, you get into a mindset -- we're in a mindset of truly looking at everything. And again, not a onetime exercise.
As Amy and John particularly have come into the business, but Greg has done the same thing, it really does start. And it's not limited to, but it starts with fundamentally the merchandise that you're selling. And as I mentioned in a quick comment on the first question on this call, Amy is very intensely focused on understanding that target customer and reworking the assortments at PINK. And John, again now 13 weeks in, has truly hit the ground running and is bringing to our situation a lot of great experience that he had in his prior retail life. And so we're very focused, obviously, on the merchandise. And as registered in our pre-circulated comments, that impact is showing up in the most clear way beginning in the fall season, and it will get more significant as we move through the fall season. But that is tangible and real.
From that, we're taking our look at lots of other stuff. We closed more stores or announced plans to close more stores, have closed more stores, to rightsize square footage in 2019 than we had historically, as an example of taking up a hard fresh look at things. And by the way, the business also continues to invest in real estate and opens doors where it makes sense, particularly at Bath & Body Works, but also internationally. 
As it relates to marketing, Ike, in the fashion show, at the end of the day, as part of that fresh hard review of everything, we're taking a hard look at the best ways to reinforce the equities and the strengths of the Victoria's business and make appropriate adjustment to the positioning of the business. And then in concert with the changes in merchandise, how do we most effectively market those changes? And that work, as you would appreciate, is in process. When we have specific things to share publicly, we will. In some cases, we'll do that right as consumers are experiencing it for competitive reasons that you would understand. But there's active work going on with respect to how the business is marketed, as indicated by our announcement recently about a reevaluation of the fashion show.
So everything is on the table. Certainly, you mentioned international and how we're looking at that business. There are no constraints, only time frame. You would understand in that evaluation, one has to think about lease terms and lease flexibility and those kinds of things, but we're in a position where everything is on the table. Les Wexner has always led with that mindset, that it's always about looking forward and about change. And on an overall basis, certainly, he's navigated and led that well over a long, long time in specialty retail, and we're very focused on it as a management team."

You mentioned you would expect merchandise margin to improve throughout the year. But as we lap some of those other benefits, and then it sounds like maybe we're baking in some incremental tariff headwinds, just how should we think about the EBIT margin rate progression through the year for Victoria's Secret relative to that 300 basis point decline in Q1? And then kind of as a follow-up, clearly some greater divergence this year with the investment plans at Victoria's Secret versus BBW. I was hoping you could just help us understand the run rate of buying and occupancy growth at each of these concepts so we can have a better understanding of the leverage points today."

So thanks, Mark. On the progression of margin rates and EBIT rates as we move through the year, while there are puts and takes, including some benefit that we got from our proprietary credit card and some sourcing-related benefits that we got last year and into the first quarter of this year, despite those puts and takes, we would expect a progression and improvement sequentially in margin rates and the operating income result in the Victoria's business as we move through the year. Again, even despite the callouts that we had in the prepared remarks and including the pressure from the list 3 tariff moved from 10% to 25%. 
With respect to buying and occupancy dollar increases or percent growth and sales growth needed to drive leverage, in the Bath & Body business, driven by the ongoing and we think a very healthy and appropriate investment in store remodels and some pressure related to continued mix shift towards direct, again, Bath & Body is having the great outcome of growing sales in stores and online, but online is growing at a faster rate. And the P&L architecture, that penetration growth for direct in BBW in addition to the pressure related to real estate, results in a sales growth to leverage B&O in the high single or low double range, depending upon time period, again, driven by the 2 factors I just mentioned, the direct business as an aside is a very healthy profit business for BBW and VS for that matter. But that growth rate outstripping the total growth rate drives some geography change in that P&L. 
And then for Victoria's, driven by the lack of growth in square footage and our pullback on investment, the breakpoint or the leverage point for sales at VS is flat or even a little less than flat in 2019. Thanks."

And that was a result of more than a year's work and a substantial IT project to replatform that website. So that is a new base platform and was a very significant technology project. And I'm knocking on wood or a hard surface anyway, but it is up and running. And there hasn't been any significant adverse set of startup issues related to that, and that's a big deal.
And that new platform will enable us to do a lot of things. Now we need to make further investment to do those things, such as buy online, pickup in store. But another key input to achieving that consumer outcome will be the RFID project that's underway for Victoria's Secret. And it's critical that we have a very good information about our specific inventories. And we have broad assortments at Victoria's, particularly in the bra category, and so we want to make sure that we have accurate information. And this RFID project I'm mentioning will help enable a buy online, pickup in store project that we'll likely get after in 2020 after we do the RFID work this year.
We are making further investments in the digital business beyond the platform, including rolling that new platform to the international side of our business and continuing to enhance the consumer experience.
And then we are also making a significant investment in digital fulfillment capacity for Victoria's. And while outsourced, we're adding a lot of capacity for the Bath & Body side of the business as well given the growth and further potential in that business. So a lot going on, a lot of investment happening related to the online business, which again, as you know, is now running $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion for L Brands, growing at a very healthy rate on an overall basis and highly profitable."

From a big picture perspective, the company has done a great job cutting costs. You mentioned La Senza, Henri Bendel. But Victoria's Secret North America is still doing over $7 billion in sales like -- but obviously the margins have come down. What's the opportunity if you wanted to look at more cost cuts? Not necessarily closing stores, but just more efficiencies to overall improve the margin, what might those be? And then also, can you just talk about the path to profitability in China? You made some comments in the prepared remarks about that business getting a little bit better. Can you just tell us where it stands today and what you see going forward?"
285544,599266078,1751264,"L Brands, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 23, 2019",2019-05-23,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So With respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again, beyond getting margin rates where they had been. Again, the biggest cause",568,"Yes. So With respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again, beyond getting margin rates where they had been. Again, the biggest cause of decline, profit rate and profit dollar decline, at Victoria's has been erosion of margin rates, merchandise margin rates to be specific. And that's about pricing and promotion and having merchandise with emotional content. But that wasn't your question. You're asking about the expense side of the business. 
So moving down the P&L, the biggest variable expense we have is store payroll. And we believe that it's important to have appropriate coverage of square footage and of traffic volumes to drive the selling opportunity that exists in our stores. We also believe it's important to pay our associates. We have outstanding teams at a competitive level to ensure that we can attract and retain appropriately skilled store associates, and we got a lot of them given the selling opportunity in the business. But -- so with respect to store payroll, not a lot of opportunity on a rate basis for a reduction. 
With respect to occupancy cost, obviously, the action that one can take, there are 2 major things that one can do beyond driving sales volume. One is to adjust investment in remodel activity or new stores, and we've done that. We've dramatically reduced almost to 0 the investment levels at Victoria's Secret given the current state of performance.
And as leases roll off or where there's opportunity to close stores, and again, we closed more stores this year than we had probably a factor of between 2 and 3x we had done previously, so that's the other action that one can take. And then there are other -- 2 other big categories of expense to consider, and we have. One is the marketing investment in the business to drive sales. Generally, people invest in marketing because they believe it does drive top line growth, which is obviously important to any business.
But we have heavily scrutinized the marketing spend at Victoria's. And over the last 9 to 12 months, particularly, we've taken meaningful dollars out of the marketing spend at Victoria's. 
And then lastly is the home office spending in the business. And in connection with all the changes that were made in the business, in 2016, the business let go in round numbers about 300 people and made a substantial reduction in the home office workforce at that time. And we've tried to manage any growth since that time. But all the expenses are being evaluated. They have been evaluated, and we've taken significant action on those expenses at Victoria's. But the biggest opportunity is about top line growth at a healthy margin rate, and then we would get reasonable leverage on the expense lines.
With respect to China, in terms of improving the profitability there, it will be volume in existing stores; volume related to new store activity, which we have planned in 2019; and then a continued focus on -- consistent with your earlier question, a continued focus on the expense levels in that business to make sure that we're getting appropriate return on the various forms of expense structure in the China business. But it is largely a volume story in China to get to the profit we expect. Thanks."

At present, it's about 50-50. So bras and panties together, about 50%. And the balance of the business, largely apparel, about 50%. 
As I mentioned in an earlier comment, we believe we have our greatest competitive advantage and strong attributes around customer or consumer loyalty in the intimate apparel business. And so it's our intention, Amy's intention, Les' intention, the team's intention, to grow the intimate business faster than the apparel business. So I would expect that, that mix of about 50-50 will skew to intimates being obviously greater than 50% over the next year or 2. That's our focus for the reasons I mentioned.
With respect to the apparel part of the business, and Amy will comment on all of this on September 10 when we have our time together, she's relooking at all of it in terms of price points, good, better, best opportunities, fabric and fabrication, surface design, various logo treatments, et cetera. She's looking at all of it, testing a lot of things, seeing some positive consumer reaction to some of the things that have been tested. And as we've mentioned consistently -- and Kimberly, you're familiar with one of the additional advantages that PINK has in its operating model, its business model, our short lead times and a mindset around speed and agility, so they are chasing hard.

That's not the business that we're in. Others are in that business and that's fine, and they have operating models and all kinds of things that make that work for them. But that's not what our company has done for more than 55 years. We're about fashion. And when we lack fashion, lack newness, lack innovation, where it's not interesting, the result becomes apparent. 
And so in answer to your question about is John focused on that or what's his assessment, again, he'll, for himself, articulate all that in early September. But our observation, his observation is that there is a substantial opportunity to remix the assortment, and that's not just words on a PowerPoint chart or my comment on an earnings call. He's doing real work on that with the team and it's substantial work. And he's working with our sourcing partners and our vendor partners, which we have strong relationship and good capability. And there's a lot happening.
Will it all be perfect and all work right out of the box? I'm sure it won't. But he's making substantial change. We believe it's positive change that makes sense. And that -- the specifics of that will become apparent as we move through the fall season. And again, he'll share his thinking in September with you and the investment community. So -- but a substantial change, a substantial opportunity for more fashion in the business. Thank you."

With respect to the potential for additional or different third-party brands in the swim business, absolutely. We've been pleased, as I mentioned in prior commentary, been pleased with the overall result. But we'll continue to look at our offering in swim, including the offerings from various third-party brands. And I'm confident that there'll be a change there, and that's not a negative comment about who we're doing with -- business with today. We've been, again, pleased on an overall basis. But again, like with anything, you want to continue to evolve it, advance it, change it and I'm sure it'll be an ongoing change in the lineup, if you will, of third-party brands.

We believe there's some potential there in our business through collaborations of various types and we're actively working in that space as well.

One, they've got strong growth at healthy margins in all of their major books of business. So that's really good. The metaphor of firing on all cylinders, they are in terms of the home fragrance business, the hand soap business and the body care business. So that's got them excited.
What leads to that is the regular introduction of newness and fashion in those categories. If we take some examples, recent examples, the launch of gingham in their body care business and fragrance categories has -- had a very strong positive consumer response. It's sophisticated, it's elevated and their customer and new customers both have responded very well to it.
So what's got them excited is -- and they don't -- they're not -- they don't bat 1,000%. They don't get it right every time, but their major books of business are performing well. And where they've introduced compelling new fashion and newness in their key items, key categories, they've gotten a strong consumer response, so that's got them excited. And they leveraged a very fast supply chain to manage the risk of that. They do a good job of it.
With respect to inventory, and we commented about inventories, some inventory investment at Bath & Body Works. Obviously, the top line trend in the business is very good. But we missed some business in 2018 because we got very lean on inventory. And so the last thing you want to do is literally not be able to fulfill your sales potential because you got too lean. So learning from that and doing it in a balanced way, we're making a little bit more investment ahead of key holiday periods to ensure that we've got the appropriate in-stock positions to maximize the business. So that's what's going on.
That team has managed inventory in an extraordinary way over the last 10 years, improving turn to beyond 4x a year and driving strong sales and margin result, consumer experience as part of that. And so our confidence level in that team working with our vendor partners to manage the supply chain, inventory flow, all of that, is very, very high based on a lot of strong results over the years. So not concerned about it. Thank you."

Our second quarter earnings per share results of $0.24 was above our initial guidance of $0.15 to $0.20 with upside driven by favorability in income taxes. Bath & Body Works continues to deliver strong results with an 8% comp increase and a 7% increase in operating income. The operating income increased at Bath & Body Works and improvement in the international business and in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
Looking to the second half of the year. Our #1 priority continues to be improving performance at Victoria's Secret. As we noted in the commentary that we released last night, John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, respectively, have made significant changes to our fall assortments. The significant amount of change in our fall merchandise assortments and promotional plans as well as the current trade environment and tariff uncertainty inherently result in a greater level of uncertainty in forecasting our results for the third and fourth quarters than is typical. That said, we believe the customers will react positively to our new merchandise. And therefore, as we said consistently, we have assumed in our guidance that Victoria's Secret trends will improve versus recent performance and that Bath & Body Works will continue to deliver strong results. You'll hear more from John and Amy as well as other business leaders at our Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 10.

So as it relates to the new lingerie assortment, modern lingerie, as we refer to it, and initial results as we provided commentary in our pre-released remarks, the consumer reaction, Kimberly, to the new assortment and the new items in the assortment has been favorable and positive and consumers reacting well. But as you point out in your question. And I can report to you is what we've observed so far and how things will progress as we see it based on what we believe for fall, the reaction to the new stuff has been very good. With that said, it hasn't been to date sufficient to overcome weakness in the balance of the lingerie assortment, including the effect of heavy promotions from a year ago that will continue through the fall season. 
Importantly, there will be additional new merchandise flowing through the fall season. So the full fall assortment was not in stores in the first few weeks of August, so we're reading a partial result. Additionally, we're very optimistic about our offering and the potential for growth in the sleep and lounge business that, as you appreciate SKUs in terms of its proportion to the total to a greater percentage of that total as we move through the fall season, given its giftability and just general seasonality for sleep and lounge, we've got more work that we're doing on marketing. And we believe that our marketing effectiveness will improve as we move through the fall season. So qualitatively, that would be the additional perspective that we have in answer to your question. So consumer reaction, again strong and favorable to the new offerings yet not sufficient to deliver an overall result that changes the trend so far. More new merchandise flowing through the balance of fall and a lot of work going on in marketing to more effectively market the changes and drive traffic in the stores."

We made that decision relatively late in 2018 into early 2019. So our reentry into that business happened in the latter part of March, as I recall it. So we missed a little bit of the natural season for swim. It generated, in round numbers, about $30 million of volume, $40 million of volume versus what it had been in the past. We do believe that there is substantial additional growth opportunity in swim. Our focus, as we've conveyed previously, is to pursue that business online and generally, with a more elevated assortment than what we had offered in the past. And consumer reaction to that, while there was a little bit of commentary at there about price points, overall, the reaction to what we put in front of customers was positive. So it was a good start, particularly given the timing of our decision. There is meaningful additional growth opportunity in that category. Again, I'm repeating but I'm trying to make sure I'm being clear. We intend to pursue that at this time online and not in stores. 
With respect to lingerie inventory, the first thing, Paul, I want to register, and you know this having followed us for a long, long time, is that we're working very hard to maintain a lot -- as much flexibility as possible, particularly for the fourth quarter, and through our focus on reducing lead times and ordering frequently and adjusting regularly. John Mehas and his team are working the assortment, literally almost every week in terms of adjusting the on-order. We are making important investments in the new parts of the assortment. And with that said, we've got a lot of flexibility, in particular for the fourth quarter to read and react to the overall trend and to adjust the on-order, obviously, to maximize our chase in pursuit of the items that are doing best and to cancel or adjust out of items that aren't doing as well. So we're making important investments. Again, optimistic in terms of the reaction to the new offering, certainly in total. And we've got a lot of flexibility.

And the reason you're asking about marketing for Victoria's is it's an important part of that business.

He spent his initial focus on the merchandise because that is the longest lead-time item in the business, and he's done substantial work in that space, frankly, extraordinary amounts of work in terms of change in a short period of time since he joined us. And he's now shifting his time not to the exclusion of merchandising. That's a core ongoing responsibility, obviously. But he's getting more and more involved in marketing.

So in terms of that traffic of Bath & Body Works in the second quarter, it was about flat, store-level traffic flat year-on-year. And the growth in the business came through transaction increases driven by conversion. 
With respect to the refresh program, as we've commented on consistently and updated in our script, we're very pleased with the results of it. The refresh activity has not been limited to A malls, but it's also happened in other mall tiers. We are seeing strong results in almost every situation, whether it's an A or a B mall or a C mall or an outlet center. We're seeing strong results broad-based, very, very few exceptions to that. And we'll keep pursuing the program. Obviously, as we move down into the fleet, we'll continue to watch the ROIs, but again they've been good so far. And we're very optimistic about continuing to pursue this program over the next several years. 
With respect to the ROI on the program and just the unit-level economics for Bath & Body Works, frankly, they're just outstanding. They're very solid. That said, as you can see in our information that we share externally, the fleet is actively managed. So even if Bath & Body Works we closed a few stores every year, and we're also opening stores as well. We're expanding square footage modestly, I think, carefully. But the fleet is in great shape. And the most important thing about that remodel program is, in addition to the financial profile almost immediately being strong, it really sets the business up very well for the next 7 to 10 years with a very current store design that consumers respond well to. So we won't be in with some retailers can get into, which is kind of a deferred CapEx situation. So it's a very good outcome for the business."

As Amie came into the business, and she will comment on this further when we're together in September, she assessed a lot of things, as you would expect that she would. And based on that assessment, she believed that there was opportunity to drive engagement in terms of transactions and unit volume in lower price points. She has been careful to not go -- working hard to not to go ditch to ditch on that. But she's just trying to make sure that she's got what we would call a balanced assortment pyramid or assortment architecture between good, better and best and felt that the business had gotten a little tilted towards higher price points.

With respect to China, it's a multiyear situation. We do have some flagship stores there that play an important role in marketing the business, but they are generating some losses.

Susan, so I think, as you would know, but it's important just to reiterate, the most important thing we've done in the digital business is the project that we went live with in the last few months, which was a replatforming -- a full replatforming of victoriassecret.com. It had been running on systems and hardware that were more than 25 years old. And it served that legacy system, homegrown system, by the way, served the business very, very well for a long time. But it was time to upgrade that platform, which is a big deal, obviously, in terms of getting that right and doing it well. And again, the business -- the domestic business has been running on that new platform now for a couple of months. So that's the most important thing. It will enable us to pursue a number of customer-facing benefits that we are now moving forward to. And those would be things like buy online, pick up in store. 
Another foundational element that we're working on now before we roll with buy online, pickup in store and other similar things is we want to make sure that we have appropriate accuracy in our inventory. And obviously, we have that for financial statement purposes, but I'm talking about at the item level at a specific location on a particular day. And with a very broad assortment, with so many choices and the broad business, particularly at Victoria's, that inventory accuracy is critical, which is why we're in 2019 pursuing on RFID initiative and rolling out an RFID initiative for Victoria's Secret. So with the foundation of the new domestic what we call the domestic order management system and accurate inventories that are sufficient to make reasonable promises to customers, it will be able to do a lot of things that many other retailers can do today. 
One of the other things that the new system allows us to do is to have a broader distribution network for Victoria's in the United States, which will allow us to add capacity and have more flexibility with capacity. So that's another benefit that we're getting now. So that's the biggest thing that -- those are the biggest things, I should say, that we've been working on. 
Bath & Body, as you know, it wasn't implicit in your question, has a terrific online business in addition to  Victoria's growing at a very healthy rate, and they're regularly looking at ways to upgrade the customer experience in that part of the business as well. Thanks."

So it's something we have renewed our capabilities in. And today, we would judge our capabilities in that area in terms of speed and agility in our supply chain as among the best in retailing based on what we know. 
With respect to the use of airfreight, frankly, substantially everything that we have produced outside the United States is on an airplane, other than some gift and accessory business. And it's because the value in our judgment of speed and agility is the question you're asking about economic value of that far outstrips the incremental cost of moving stuff on a boat. And as we like to say around here, you can't sell it if it's on a boat, by the way. So our agility is good.

And the balance point, which you recognize in the question is that it tends to be that the broader-based promotions to drive more consumer response and more traffic in an overall sense. So we're trying to strike that balance. The variable that's different from a year or 2 ago, and this is what makes the business interesting and fun, particularly when you largely figure it out, is that the assortment's different. So you could look at a promotional strategy in isolation and say, ""Hey, didn't I try this a few years ago, and it didn't work. So like, what I might thinking, right?"" I'm again trying to make a point. But the dynamic has to include an evaluation of the strength of the assortment. It all starts with that.

The other aspect of what John and Amie have done is to have a clear demarcation between the Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK businesses.

We have taken, what I call, targeted actions to reduce expenses in connection with a lot of the change at Victoria's Secret. In 2016 and 2017, we have -- we took substantial home office cost reductions. And in more recent periods, over the last year to 18 months, we've taken a lot of expense out of the business in terms of variable expenses and selling certain selling areas and in marketing as examples. 
But there's always more that you can do, but it comes we trade-offs. And you've got to be thoughtful about not getting into an ongoing cost-cutting exercise that can hurt the near-term and longer-term prospects for the business. So we're trying to strike the right balance, and we'll continue to monitor that as time progresses. If retail selling trends don't improve, margin trends don't improve at Victoria's Secret, you would expect us to take another hard fundamental look at expenses. And what we're focused on to the greatest extent right now is getting the results at retail in terms of sales and margin. But there are other things that we could look at but they again come with trade-offs. Thanks."

Could you -- I know we've talked about the outlook for promotions and how you're working on the mix as targeted versus more broad-based. Can you tell us how you thought about the expectations for the promotional environment outside of your business as we head into the fourth quarter? I'm really -- I'm trying to reconcile the guidance for inventory should be up in the mid-teens with the comp items you baked in for fourth quarter. And I guess merch margins plan to be down a little bit but since I know a lot of the year, a lot of the annual earnings happens in the fourth quarter, I'm trying to think about how much room you might have left yourself given what we've heard so far in second quarter is a fairly volatile outlook for the rest of the year as far as where the peer group and promotional levels would be for the holiday."

So a couple of thoughts and reactions to your questions or response to your questions. The first is in the lingerie part of Victoria's particularly, the -- what we would call the initial markup or the inherent markup in the goods is substantially greater than what it had been. And so that provides the opportunity for higher-margin rate results and more flexibility or room, if needed, to promote the business. Again, that's not our going-in plan. But as we've talked about, we needed to balance volume with rate. And again, the point I'm trying to register is that there is higher markup in the goods in terms of their initial retails and their cost. So that gives us more flexibility than we've had over the last few years. 
With respect to the promotional environment, there are others in the industry and in our company that have been doing this longer than I have. I've been doing this for a while. And going into every holiday, there's commentary about how it's going to be more promotional than ever. I am aware that we're in our 10th year of economic recovery, and there's is greater discussion understandably about the potential for a recession. But the truth is, absent a dramatic change in the environment like we saw in '08 and '09, we sell relatively affordable things. They are discretionary, but they're relatively affordable break. And I would say, as a close to home data point, we look at Bath & Body's results in what folks might say is a promotional retail environment, and they're very strong results. And again, where those come from is a compelling brand position, a compelling merchandise assortment, well executed in the most complete sense. And we think that Victoria's has that opportunity. So there's nothing about the promotional environment per se that I would say is uniquely different versus most typical years. And it's really in our hands to deliver compelling assortments, again, well delivered in stores and online to get to a good result. And we have higher inherent markup to work with. Thanks."

Our second quarter earnings per share result of $0.24 was above our initial guidance of $0.15 to $0.20 with upside driven by favorability in income taxes. Bath & Body Works continues to deliver strong results with an 8% comp increase and a 7% increase in operating income. The operating income increased at Bath & Body Works and improvement in the international business and in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
Looking to the second half of the year. Our #1 priority continues to be improving performance at Victoria's Secret. As we noted in the commentary that we released last night, John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, respectively, have made significant changes to our fall assortments. The significant amount of change in our fall merchandise assortments and promotional plans as well as the current trade environment and tariff uncertainty inherently result in a greater level of uncertainty in forecasting our results for the third and fourth quarters than is typical. That said, we believe the customers will react positively to our new merchandise. And therefore, as we said consistently, we have assumed in our guidance that Victoria's Secret trends will improve versus recent performance and that Bath & Body Works will continue to deliver strong results. You'll hear more from John and Amy as well as other business leaders at our Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 10.

So as it relates to the new lingerie assortment, modern lingerie, as we refer to it, and initial results as we provided commentary in our pre-released remarks, the consumer reaction, Kimberly, to the new assortment and the new items in the assortment has been favorable and positive and consumers reacting well. 
But as you point out in your question, and it -- and all I can report to you is what we've observed so far and how things will progress as we see it based on what we believe for fall, the reaction to the new stuff has been very good. With that said, it hasn't been to date sufficient to overcome weakness in the balance of the lingerie assortment, including the effect of heavy promotions from a year ago that will continue through the fall season. Importantly, there will be additional new merchandise flowing through the fall season. So the full fall assortment was not in stores in the first few weeks of August, so we're reading a partial result. 
Additionally, we're very optimistic about our offering and the potential for growth in the sleep and lounge business that, as you appreciate, SKUs in terms of its proportion to the total to a greater percentage of that total as we move through the fall season, given its giftability and just general seasonality for sleep and lounge, we've got more work that we're doing on marketing. And we believe that our marketing effectiveness will improve as we move through the fall season. 
So qualitatively, that would be the additional perspective that we have in answer to your question. So consumer reaction, again, strong and favorable to the new offerings yet not sufficient to deliver an overall result that changes the trend so far, more new merchandise flowing through the balance of fall and a lot of work going on in marketing to more effectively market the changes and drive traffic in the stores.

We made that decision relatively late in 2018 into early 2019. So our reentry into that business happened in the latter part of March, as I recall it. So we missed a little bit of the natural season for swim. It generated, in round numbers, about $30 million of volume, $40 million of volume versus what it had been in the past. We do believe that there is substantial additional growth opportunity in swim. Our focus, as we've conveyed previously, is to pursue that business online and generally with a more elevated assortment than what we had offered in the past. And consumer reaction to that, while there was a little bit of commentary out there about price points, overall, the reaction to what we put in front of customers was positive. So it was a good start particularly given the timing of our decision. There is meaningful additional growth opportunity in that category. Again, I'm repeating, but I'm trying to make sure I'm being clear. We intend to pursue that at this time online and not in stores. 
With respect to lingerie inventory, the first thing, Paul, I'd want to register, and you know this having followed us for a long, long time, is that we're working very hard to maintain a lot -- as much flexibility as possible, particularly for the fourth quarter, and through our focus on reducing lead times and ordering frequently and adjusting regularly. John Mehas and his team are working the assortment literally almost every week in terms of adjusting the on-order. We are making important investments in the new parts of the assortment. And with that said, we've got a lot of flexibility in particular for the fourth quarter to read and react to the overall trend and to adjust the on-order obviously to maximize our chase and pursuit of the items that are doing best and to cancel or adjust out of items that aren't doing as well. 
So we're making important investments. Again, optimistic in terms of the reaction to the new offering certainly in total, and we got a lot of flexibility. Was there a third part to Paul's question?"

And that's an all-in definition, including GWPs and all forms of marketing. The most important thing I would want to register about marketing, and we've been pretty consistent in this mindset now for as long as maybe 12 months, certainly 6 to 9 months, is that everything is on the table. And what's meant by that is we're taking a fresh hard look at almost every material aspect of our business. 
And the reason you're asking about marketing for Victoria's is it's an important part of that business. So in terms of the messaging, the imagery, the photography, the words, the pricing, promotional aspects of it, the medium of communication, the integration of marketing between stores and digital and social channels, John is getting more and more involved in it. He spent his initial focus on the merchandise because that is the longest lead-time item in the business, and he's done substantial work in that space, frankly, extraordinary amounts of work in terms of change in a short period of time since he joined us. And he's now shifting his time -- not to the exclusion of merchandising. That's a core ongoing responsibility obviously, but he's getting more and more involved in marketing. 
You've read that we've had changes in senior leadership in marketing. And I expect that there will be meaningful and hopefully thoughtful change in our marketing approach as we move through fall and into 2020. John will comment further on that, I would expect, when we're together in September."

And the growth in the business came through transaction increases driven by conversion. 
With respect to the refresh program, as we've commented on consistently and updated in our script, we're very pleased with the results of it. The refresh activity has not been limited to A malls but has also happened in other mall tiers. We are seeing strong results in almost every situation. Whether it's an A or a B mall or a C mall or an outlet center, we're seeing strong results broad-based, very, very few exceptions to that. And we'll keep pursuing the program. Obviously, as we move down into the fleet, we'll continue to watch the ROIs. But again, they've been good so far, and we're very optimistic about continuing to pursue this program over the next several years. 
With respect to the ROI on the program and just the unit-level economics for Bath & Body Works, frankly, they're just outstanding. They're very solid. That said, as you can see in our information that we share externally, the fleet is actively managed. So even at Bath & Body Works, we close a few stores every year, and we're also opening stores as well. We're expanding square footage modestly or, I think, carefully. But the fleet is in great shape. And the most important thing about that remodel program is, in addition to the financial profile almost immediately being strong, it really sets the business up very well for the next 7 to 10 years with a very current store design that consumers respond well to. So we won't be in what some retailers can get into, which is a kind of a deferred CapEx situation. So it's a very good outcome for the business."

She's been careful to not go -- working hard to -- not to go ditch to ditch on that. But she's just trying to make sure that she's got what we would call a balanced assortment pyramid or assortment architecture between good, better and best and felt that the business had gotten a little tilted towards higher price points.

So simple answer to your question, is there an opportunity to make meaningful change in our marketing message and approach for the fourth quarter, the answer is yes. 
With respect to China, it's a multiyear situation, Ike. We do have some flagship stores there that play an important role in marketing the business, but they are generating some losses.

Thanks, Susan. So I think as you would know, but it's important just to reiterate, the most important thing we've done in the digital business is a project that we went live with in the last few months, which was a replatforming -- a full replatforming of victoriassecret.com. It had been running on systems and hardware that were more than 25 years old. And it served that legacy system, homegrown system, by the way, served the business very, very well for a long time. But it was time to upgrade that platform, which is a big deal obviously in terms of getting that right and doing it well. And again, the business -- the domestic business has been running on that new platform now for a couple of months. So that's the most important thing. It will enable us to pursue a number of customer-facing benefits that we're now moving forward to. And those would be things like buy online, pick up in store. 
Another foundational element that we're working on now before we roll with buy online, pickup in store and other similar things is we want to make sure that we have appropriate accuracy in our inventory. And obviously, we have that for financial statement purposes, but I'm talking about at the item level at a specific location on a particular day. And with a very broad assortment, with so many choices in the broad business, particularly at Victoria's, that inventory accuracy is critical, which is why we're in 2019 pursuing on RFID initiative and rolling out an RFID initiative for Victoria's Secret. So with the foundation of the new domestic -- what we call the domestic order management system and accurate inventories that are sufficient to make reasonable promises to customers, we will be able to do a lot of things that many other retailers can do today. 
One of the other things that the new system allows us to do is to have a broader distribution network for Victoria's in the United States, which will allow us to add capacity and have more flexibility with capacity. So that's another benefit that we're getting now. So that's the biggest thing that -- those are the biggest things, I should say, that we've been working on. 
Bath & Body, as you know, it wasn't implicit in your question, has a terrific online business in addition to Victoria's growing at a very healthy rate. And they're regularly looking at ways to upgrade the customer experience in that part of the business as well. Thanks."

And so we've got a number of things going on that we think will move the business in a favorable way and should represent a lot of upside in what is already a very sound business.

And then with respect to speed and agility in the supply chain, it's been -- it's a legacy part of our business in a positive way. It's something that less focused on as long ago as the late '70s and early '80s. And we renewed our work in that area beginning now 7 or 8 years ago, both on the apparel -- the intimate apparel side of the business and in the personal care and beauty side of the business. So it's something we have renewed our capabilities in. And today, we would judge our capabilities in that area in terms of speed and agility in our supply chain as among the best in retailing based on what we know. 
With respect to the use of airfreight, frankly, substantially everything that we have produced outside the United States is on an airplane, other than some gift and accessory business. And it's because the value in our judgment of speed and agility, the question you're asking about, the economic value of that far outstrips the incremental cost of moving stuff on a boat. And as we like to say around here, ""You can't sell it if it's on a boat, by the way."" So our agility is good. And our standard model, if you will, with respect to things that are produced outside of the United States is, in fact, to move it by air. So the speed part of the businesses are fundamental, as we see it, and we're in good shape."

So in terms of targeted versus broad-based promos, Omar, we continue to pursue the right balance between those 2 things. And the considerations in that is if you have a very broad-based promo, then you're essentially discounting the whole assortment, if you will, if it's very broad-based. I'm exaggerating a little bit to make a point. Whereas if you have targeted promos, obviously, you're not discounting large portions of the entire assortment, and you can get more full-price selling on particularly strong choices within the assortment. 
And the balance point, which you recognize in the question, is that it tends to be that the broader-based promotions drive more consumer response and more traffic in an overall sense. So we're trying to strike that balance. The variable that's different from a year or 2 ago, and this is what makes the business interesting and fun, particularly when you largely figure it out, is that the assortment's different. So you could look at a promotional strategy in isolation and say, ""Hey, didn't I try this a few years ago, and it didn't work? So like what are they thinking, right?"" I'm again trying to make a point. But the dynamic has to include an evaluation of the strength of the assortment. It all starts with that. And with the work that Amy and John have been doing, we're optimistic that we can get reasonable result without having to do a substantial number of broad-based promotions. 
All that said, we've got a lot of flexibility there. And we will continue to test and learn and make trade-offs. And we'll be reevaluating the promotional strategy as we move through the fall season to get to the right customer response, get the right traffic, get the right margin dollars to work hard to deliver the results that are embedded in the forecast. 
The second part of the question was about trends within the months. So June was the strongest of the months, as I recall, and July was the weakest of the months, Omar, in the quarter -- second quarter for Victoria's, yes."

So with respect to an evaluation of good, better, best pricing and opportunities in the lingerie part of Victoria's, it's one of the most fundamental things that any merchant leader in any retail leadership team would evaluate. And so John has made that assessment for Victoria's Secret Lingerie. And the number of offerings at the better and best price points for Victoria's Secret Lingerie is up meaningfully versus what it had been. And that's based on -- if you've seen the merchandise online or in stores, you would see more sophisticated merchandise with a lot more, we believe, emotional content. And as we talked about at the start of the call, initial response from consumers to those new offerings has been good. 
The other aspect of what John and Amy have done is to have a clearer demarcation between the Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK businesses. Again, PINK is targeted towards a college-aged customer, and lingerie, more typically, somebody that would be postcollege and at higher price points and with a greater degree of sophistication. So that's another aspect of the good, better, best pricing work that both leaders have done to properly segment and position their respective businesses."

And the company has worked hard to be efficient over its long history and including at our -- in our record result of 2015 when we had an overall company 18% operating income rate that -- one of the contributors to that was the highly efficient business. 
With that said, we've had a lot of sales pressure and margin rate pressure in the business. We have taken what I'd call targeted actions to reduce expenses in connection with a lot of the change at Victoria's Secret. In 2016 and 2017, we have -- we took substantial home office cost reductions. And in more recent periods, over the last year to 18 months, we've taken a lot of expense out of the business in terms of variable expenses in selling -- certain selling areas and in marketing as examples. But there's always more that you can do, but it comes with trade-offs. And you've got to be thoughtful about not getting into an ongoing cost-cutting exercise that can hurt the near-term and longer-term prospects for the business. 
So we're trying to strike the right balance, and we'll continue to monitor that as time progresses. If retail selling trends don't improve, margin trends don't improve at Victoria's Secret, you would expect us to take another hard fundamental look at expenses. And what we're focused on to the greatest extent right now is getting the results at retail in terms of sales and margin. But there are other things that we could look at, but they again come with trade-offs. Thanks."

Could you -- I know we've talked about the outlook for promotions and how you're working on the mix of targeted versus more broad-based. Can you tell us how you thought about the expectations for the promotional environment outside of your business as we head into the fourth quarter? I'm really -- I'm trying to reconcile the guidance for inventories to be up in the mid-teens with the comp items that you baked in for fourth quarter and, I guess, merch margins planned to be down a little bit. But since I know a lot of the year, a lot of the annual earnings happens in the fourth quarter, I'm trying to think about how much room you might have left for yourself given what we've heard so far in second quarter is a fairly volatile outlook for the rest of the year as far as where the peer group's promotional levels will be for the holiday."
285544,599266339,1809809,"L Brands, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 22, 2019",2019-08-22,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So a couple of thoughts in reaction to your question or in response to your question.

So a couple of thoughts in reaction to your question or in response to your question. The first is, in the lingerie part of Victoria's particularly, the -- what we would call the initial markup or the inherent markup in the goods is substantially greater than what it had been. And so that provides the opportunity for higher-margin rate results and more flexibility or room, if needed, to promote the business. Again, that's not our going-in plan, but as we've talked about, we needed to balance volume with rate. And again, the point I'm trying to register is there's higher markup in the goods in terms of their initial retails and their costs. So that gives us more flexibility than we've had over the last few years. 
With respect to the promotional environment, there are others in the industry and in our company that have been doing this longer than I have, and I've been doing it for a while. And going into every holiday, there's commentary about how it's going to be more promotional than ever. I am aware that we're in our 10th year of an economic recovery, and there's greater discussion understandably about the potential for a recession. But the truth is, absent a dramatic change in the environment like we saw in '08 and '09, we sell relatively affordable things. They are discretionary, but they're relatively affordable. And I would say, as a close-to-home data point, we look at Bath & Body's results in what folks might say is a promotional retail environment, and they're very strong results. And again, what those come from is a compelling brand position, a compelling merchandise assortment, well executed in the most complete sense. And we think that Victoria's has that opportunity. 
So there's nothing about the promotional environment per se that I would say is uniquely different versus most typical years. And it's really in our hands to deliver compelling assortments, again, well delivered in stores and online to get to a good result. And we have higher inherent markup to work with. Thanks."

The operating income increased at Bath & Body Works and improvement in the international business and in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
Looking to the second half of the year. Our #1 priority continues to be improving performance at Victoria's Secret. As we noted in the commentary that we released last night, John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, respectively, have made significant changes to our fall assortments. The significant amount of change in our fall merchandise assortments and promotional plans as well as the current trade environment and tariff uncertainty inherently result in a greater level of uncertainty in forecasting our results for the third and fourth quarters than is typical. That said, we believe the customers will react positively to our new merchandise. And therefore, as we said consistently, we have assumed in our guidance that Victoria's Secret trends will improve versus recent performance and that Bath & Body Works will continue to deliver strong results.

So as it relates to the new lingerie assortment, modern lingerie, as we refer to it, and initial results as we provided commentary in our pre-released remarks, the consumer reaction, Kimberly, to the new assortment and the new items in the assortment has been favorable and positive and consumers reacting well. 
But as you point out in your question, and it -- and all I can report to you is what we've observed so far and how things will progress as we see it based on what we believe for fall, the reaction to the new stuff has been very good. With that said, it hasn't been to date sufficient to overcome weakness in the balance of the lingerie assortment, including the effect of heavy promotions from a year ago that will continue through the fall season. Importantly, there will be additional new merchandise flowing through the fall season. So the full fall assortment was not in stores in the first few weeks of August, so we're reading a partial result. 
Additionally, we're very optimistic about our offering and the potential for growth in the sleep and lounge business that, as you appreciate, SKUs in terms of its proportion to the total to a greater percentage of that total as we move through the fall season, given its giftability and just general seasonality for sleep and lounge, we've got more work that we're doing on marketing. And we believe that our marketing effectiveness will improve as we move through the fall season. 
So qualitatively, that would be the additional perspective that we have in answer to your question. So consumer reaction, again, strong and favorable to the new offerings yet not sufficient to deliver an overall result that changes the trend so far, more new merchandise flowing through the balance of fall and a lot of work going on in marketing to more effectively market the changes and drive traffic in the stores.

We made that decision relatively late in 2018 into early 2019. So our reentry into that business happened in the latter part of March, as I recall it. So we missed a little bit of the natural season for swim. It generated, in round numbers, about $30 million of volume, $40 million of volume versus what it had been in the past. We do believe that there is substantial additional growth opportunity in swim. Our focus, as we've conveyed previously, is to pursue that business online and generally with a more elevated assortment than what we had offered in the past. And consumer reaction to that, while there was a little bit of commentary out there about price points, overall, the reaction to what we put in front of customers was positive. So it was a good start particularly given the timing of our decision. There is meaningful additional growth opportunity in that category. Again, I'm repeating, but I'm trying to make sure I'm being clear. We intend to pursue that at this time online and not in stores. 
With respect to lingerie inventory, the first thing, Paul, I'd want to register, and you know this having followed us for a long, long time, is that we're working very hard to maintain a lot -- as much flexibility as possible, particularly for the fourth quarter, and through our focus on reducing lead times and ordering frequently and adjusting regularly. John Mehas and his team are working the assortment literally almost every week in terms of adjusting the on-order. We are making important investments in the new parts of the assortment. And with that said, we've got a lot of flexibility in particular for the fourth quarter to read and react to the overall trend and to adjust the on-order obviously to maximize our chase and pursuit of the items that are doing best and to cancel or adjust out of items that aren't doing as well. 
So we're making important investments. Again, optimistic in terms of the reaction to the new offering certainly in total, and we got a lot of flexibility. Was there a third part to Paul's question?"

And that's an all-in definition, including GWPs and all forms of marketing. The most important thing I would want to register about marketing, and we've been pretty consistent in this mindset now for as long as maybe 12 months, certainly 6 to 9 months, is that everything is on the table. And what's meant by that is we're taking a fresh hard look at almost every material aspect of our business. 
And the reason you're asking about marketing for Victoria's is it's an important part of that business. So in terms of the messaging, the imagery, the photography, the words, the pricing, promotional aspects of it, the medium of communication, the integration of marketing between stores and digital and social channels, John is getting more and more involved in it. He spent his initial focus on the merchandise because that is the longest lead-time item in the business, and he's done substantial work in that space, frankly, extraordinary amounts of work in terms of change in a short period of time since he joined us. And he's now shifting his time -- not to the exclusion of merchandising. That's a core ongoing responsibility obviously, but he's getting more and more involved in marketing. 
You've read that we've had changes in senior leadership in marketing. And I expect that there will be meaningful and hopefully thoughtful change in our marketing approach as we move through fall and into 2020. John will comment further on that, I would expect, when we're together in September."

So in terms of the traffic at Bath & Body Works in the second quarter, it was about flat, store-level traffic flat year-on-year. And the growth in the business came through transaction increases driven by conversion. 
With respect to the refresh program, as we've commented on consistently and updated in our script, we're very pleased with the results of it. The refresh activity has not been limited to A malls but has also happened in other mall tiers. We are seeing strong results in almost every situation. Whether it's an A or a B mall or a C mall or an outlet center, we're seeing strong results broad-based, very, very few exceptions to that. And we'll keep pursuing the program. Obviously, as we move down into the fleet, we'll continue to watch the ROIs. But again, they've been good so far, and we're very optimistic about continuing to pursue this program over the next several years. 
With respect to the ROI on the program and just the unit-level economics for Bath & Body Works, frankly, they're just outstanding. They're very solid. That said, as you can see in our information that we share externally, the fleet is actively managed. So even at Bath & Body Works, we close a few stores every year, and we're also opening stores as well. We're expanding square footage modestly or, I think, carefully. But the fleet is in great shape. And the most important thing about that remodel program is, in addition to the financial profile almost immediately being strong, it really sets the business up very well for the next 7 to 10 years with a very current store design that consumers respond well to. So we won't be in what some retailers can get into, which is a kind of a deferred CapEx situation. So it's a very good outcome for the business."

So simple answer to your question, is there an opportunity to make meaningful change in our marketing message and approach for the fourth quarter, the answer is yes. 
With respect to China, it's a multiyear situation, Ike. We do have some flagship stores there that play an important role in marketing the business, but they are generating some losses. And I -- our view at this point would be it's a 3- or 4-year journey in China to get to the -- to a profit profile in that business, 3- or 4-year journey."

Thanks, Susan. So I think as you would know, but it's important just to reiterate, the most important thing we've done in the digital business is a project that we went live with in the last few months, which was a replatforming -- a full replatforming of victoriassecret.com. It had been running on systems and hardware that were more than 25 years old. And it served that legacy system, homegrown system, by the way, served the business very, very well for a long time. But it was time to upgrade that platform, which is a big deal obviously in terms of getting that right and doing it well. And again, the business -- the domestic business has been running on that new platform now for a couple of months. So that's the most important thing. It will enable us to pursue a number of customer-facing benefits that we're now moving forward to. And those would be things like buy online, pick up in store. 
Another foundational element that we're working on now before we roll with buy online, pickup in store and other similar things is we want to make sure that we have appropriate accuracy in our inventory. And obviously, we have that for financial statement purposes, but I'm talking about at the item level at a specific location on a particular day. And with a very broad assortment, with so many choices in the broad business, particularly at Victoria's, that inventory accuracy is critical, which is why we're in 2019 pursuing on RFID initiative and rolling out an RFID initiative for Victoria's Secret. So with the foundation of the new domestic -- what we call the domestic order management system and accurate inventories that are sufficient to make reasonable promises to customers, we will be able to do a lot of things that many other retailers can do today. 
One of the other things that the new system allows us to do is to have a broader distribution network for Victoria's in the United States, which will allow us to add capacity and have more flexibility with capacity. So that's another benefit that we're getting now. So that's the biggest thing that -- those are the biggest things, I should say, that we've been working on. 
Bath & Body, as you know, it wasn't implicit in your question, has a terrific online business in addition to Victoria's growing at a very healthy rate. And they're regularly looking at ways to upgrade the customer experience in that part of the business as well. Thanks."

So the last part of that question, we're essentially almost fully open for the fourth quarter in terms of open-to-buy. So take that part of it first. 
And then with respect to speed and agility in the supply chain, it's been -- it's a legacy part of our business in a positive way. It's something that less focused on as long ago as the late '70s and early '80s. And we renewed our work in that area beginning now 7 or 8 years ago, both on the apparel -- the intimate apparel side of the business and in the personal care and beauty side of the business. So it's something we have renewed our capabilities in. And today, we would judge our capabilities in that area in terms of speed and agility in our supply chain as among the best in retailing based on what we know. 
With respect to the use of airfreight, frankly, substantially everything that we have produced outside the United States is on an airplane, other than some gift and accessory business. And it's because the value in our judgment of speed and agility, the question you're asking about, the economic value of that far outstrips the incremental cost of moving stuff on a boat. And as we like to say around here, ""You can't sell it if it's on a boat, by the way."" So our agility is good. And our standard model, if you will, with respect to things that are produced outside of the United States is, in fact, to move it by air. So the speed part of the businesses are fundamental, as we see it, and we're in good shape."

So in terms of targeted versus broad-based promos, Omar, we continue to pursue the right balance between those 2 things.

So in terms of targeted versus broad-based promos, Omar, we continue to pursue the right balance between those 2 things. And the considerations in that is if you have a very broad-based promo, then you're essentially discounting the whole assortment, if you will, if it's very broad-based. I'm exaggerating a little bit to make a point. Whereas if you have targeted promos, obviously, you're not discounting large portions of the entire assortment, and you can get more full-price selling on particularly strong choices within the assortment. 
And the balance point, which you recognize in the question, is that it tends to be that the broader-based promotions drive more consumer response and more traffic in an overall sense. So we're trying to strike that balance. The variable that's different from a year or 2 ago, and this is what makes the business interesting and fun, particularly when you largely figure it out, is that the assortment's different. So you could look at a promotional strategy in isolation and say, ""Hey, didn't I try this a few years ago, and it didn't work? So like what are they thinking, right?"" I'm again trying to make a point. But the dynamic has to include an evaluation of the strength of the assortment. It all starts with that. And with the work that Amy and John have been doing, we're optimistic that we can get reasonable result without having to do a substantial number of broad-based promotions. 
All that said, we've got a lot of flexibility there. And we will continue to test and learn and make trade-offs. And we'll be reevaluating the promotional strategy as we move through the fall season to get to the right customer response, get the right traffic, get the right margin dollars to work hard to deliver the results that are embedded in the forecast. 
The second part of the question was about trends within the months. So June was the strongest of the months, as I recall, and July was the weakest of the months, Omar, in the quarter -- second quarter for Victoria's, yes."

So with respect to an evaluation of good, better, best pricing and opportunities in the lingerie part of Victoria's, it's one of the most fundamental things that any merchant leader in any retail leadership team would evaluate. And so John has made that assessment for Victoria's Secret Lingerie. And the number of offerings at the better and best price points for Victoria's Secret Lingerie is up meaningfully versus what it had been. And that's based on -- if you've seen the merchandise online or in stores, you would see more sophisticated merchandise with a lot more, we believe, emotional content. And as we talked about at the start of the call, initial response from consumers to those new offerings has been good. 
The other aspect of what John and Amy have done is to have a clearer demarcation between the Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK businesses. Again, PINK is targeted towards a college-aged customer, and lingerie, more typically, somebody that would be postcollege and at higher price points and with a greater degree of sophistication. So that's another aspect of the good, better, best pricing work that both leaders have done to properly segment and position their respective businesses."

With that said, we've had a lot of sales pressure and margin rate pressure in the business. We have taken what I'd call targeted actions to reduce expenses in connection with a lot of the change at Victoria's Secret. In 2016 and 2017, we have -- we took substantial home office cost reductions. And in more recent periods, over the last year to 18 months, we've taken a lot of expense out of the business in terms of variable expenses in selling -- certain selling areas and in marketing as examples. But there's always more that you can do, but it comes with trade-offs. And you've got to be thoughtful about not getting into an ongoing cost-cutting exercise that can hurt the near-term and longer-term prospects for the business. 
So we're trying to strike the right balance, and we'll continue to monitor that as time progresses. If retail selling trends don't improve, margin trends don't improve at Victoria's Secret, you would expect us to take another hard fundamental look at expenses. And what we're focused on to the greatest extent right now is getting the results at retail in terms of sales and margin.

I'm really -- I'm trying to reconcile the guidance for inventories to be up in the mid-teens with the comp items that you baked in for fourth quarter and, I guess, merch margins planned to be down a little bit. But since I know a lot of the year, a lot of the annual earnings happens in the fourth quarter, I'm trying to think about how much room you might have left for yourself given what we've heard so far in second quarter is a fairly volatile outlook for the rest of the year as far as where the peer group's promotional levels will be for the holiday."

So a couple of thoughts in reaction to your question or in response to your question. The first is, in the lingerie part of Victoria's particularly, the -- what we would call the initial markup or the inherent markup in the goods is substantially greater than what it had been. And so that provides the opportunity for higher-margin rate results and more flexibility or room, if needed, to promote the business. Again, that's not our going-in plan, but as we've talked about, we needed to balance volume with rate. And again, the point I'm trying to register is there's higher markup in the goods in terms of their initial retails and their costs. So that gives us more flexibility than we've had over the last few years. 
With respect to the promotional environment, there are others in the industry and in our company that have been doing this longer than I have, and I've been doing it for a while. And going into every holiday, there's commentary about how it's going to be more promotional than ever. I am aware that we're in our 10th year of an economic recovery, and there's greater discussion understandably about the potential for a recession. But the truth is, absent a dramatic change in the environment like we saw in '08 and '09, we sell relatively affordable things. They are discretionary, but they're relatively affordable. And I would say, as a close-to-home data point, we look at Bath & Body's results in what folks might say is a promotional retail environment, and they're very strong results. And again, what those come from is a compelling brand position, a compelling merchandise assortment, well executed in the most complete sense. And we think that Victoria's has that opportunity. 
So there's nothing about the promotional environment per se that I would say is uniquely different versus most typical years. And it's really in our hands to deliver compelling assortments, again, well delivered in stores and online to get to a good result. And we have higher inherent markup to work with. Thanks."

The operating income increased at Bath & Body Works and improvement in the international business and in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret. 
Looking to the second half of the year. Our #1 priority continues to be improving performance at Victoria's Secret. As we noted in the commentary that we released last night, John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, respectively, have made significant changes to our fall assortments. The significant amount of change in our fall merchandise assortments and promotional plans as well as the current trade environment and tariff uncertainty inherently result in a greater level of uncertainty in forecasting our results for the third and fourth quarters than is typical. That said, we believe the customers will react positively to our new merchandise. And therefore, as we said consistently, we have assumed in our guidance that Victoria's Secret trends will improve versus recent performance and that Bath & Body Works will continue to deliver strong results.

So as it relates to the new lingerie assortment, modern lingerie, as we refer to it, and initial results as we provided commentary in our pre-released remarks, the consumer reaction, Kimberly, to the new assortment and the new items in the assortment has been favorable and positive and consumers reacting well. 
But as you point out in your question, and it -- and all I can report to you is what we've observed so far and how things will progress as we see it based on what we believe for fall, the reaction to the new stuff has been very good. With that said, it hasn't been to date sufficient to overcome weakness in the balance of the lingerie assortment, including the effect of heavy promotions from a year ago that will continue through the fall season. Importantly, there will be additional new merchandise flowing through the fall season. So the full fall assortment was not in stores in the first few weeks of August, so we are reading a partial result. 
Additionally, we're very optimistic about our offering and the potential for growth in the sleep and lounge business that, as you appreciate, SKUs in terms of its proportion to the total to a greater percentage of that total as we move through the fall season, given its giftability and just general seasonality for sleep and lounge, we've got more work that we're doing on marketing. And we believe that our marketing effectiveness will improve as we move through the fall season. 
So qualitatively, that would be the additional perspective that we have in answer to your question. So consumer reaction, again, strong and favorable to the new offerings yet not sufficient to deliver an overall result that changes the trend so far, more new merchandise flowing through the balance of fall and a lot of work going on in marketing to more effectively market the changes and drive traffic in the stores.

We made that decision relatively late in 2018 into early 2019. So our reentry into that business happened in the latter part of March, as I recall it. So we missed a little bit of the natural season for swim. It generated, in round numbers, about $30 million of volume, $40 million of volume versus what it had been in the past. We do believe that there is substantial additional growth opportunity in swim. Our focus, as we've conveyed previously, is to pursue that business online and generally with a more elevated assortment than what we had offered in the past. And consumer reaction to that, while there was a little bit of commentary out there about price points, overall, the reaction to what we put in front of customers was positive. So it was a good start particularly given the timing of our decision. There is meaningful additional growth opportunity in that category. Again, I'm repeating, but I'm trying to make sure I'm being clear. We intend to pursue that at this time online and not in stores. 
With respect to lingerie inventory, the first thing, Paul, I'd want to register, and you know this having followed us for a long, long time, is that we're working very hard to maintain a lot -- as much flexibility as possible, particularly for the fourth quarter, and through our focus on reducing lead times and ordering frequently and adjusting regularly. John Mehas and his team are working the assortment literally almost every week in terms of adjusting the on-order. We are making important investments in the new parts of the assortment. And with that said, we've got a lot of flexibility in particular for the fourth quarter to read and react to the overall trend and to adjust the on-order obviously to maximize our chase and pursuit of the items that are doing best and to cancel or adjust out of items that aren't doing as well. 
So we're making important investments. Again, optimistic in terms of the reaction to the new offering certainly in total, and we got a lot of flexibility. Was there a third part to Paul's question?"

And that's an all-in definition, including GWPs and all forms of marketing. The most important thing I would want to register about marketing, and we've been pretty consistent in this mindset now for as long as maybe 12 months, certainly 6 to 9 months, is that everything is on the table. And what's meant by that is we're taking a fresh hard look at almost every material aspect of our business. 
And the reason you're asking about marketing for Victoria's is it's an important part of that business. So in terms of the messaging, the imagery, the photography, the words, the pricing, promotional aspects of it, the medium of communication, the integration of marketing between stores and digital and social channels, John is getting more and more involved in it. He spent his initial focus on the merchandise because that is the longest lead-time item in the business, and he's done substantial work in that space, frankly, extraordinary amounts of work in terms of change in a short period of time since he joined us. And he's now shifting his time -- not to the exclusion of merchandising. That's a core ongoing responsibility obviously, but he's getting more and more involved in marketing. 
You've read that we've had changes in senior leadership in marketing. And I expect that there will be meaningful and hopefully thoughtful change in our marketing approach as we move through fall and into 2020. John will comment further on that, I would expect, when we're together in September."

So in terms of the traffic at Bath & Body Works in the second quarter, it was about flat, store-level traffic flat year-on-year. And the growth in the business came through transaction increases driven by conversion. 
With respect to the refresh program, as we've commented on consistently and updated in our script, we're very pleased with the results of it. The refresh activity has not been limited to A malls but has also happened in other mall tiers. We are seeing strong results in almost every situation. Whether it's an A or a B mall or a C mall or an outlet center, we're seeing strong results broad-based, very, very few exceptions to that. And we'll keep pursuing the program. Obviously, as we move down into the fleet, we'll continue to watch the ROIs. But again, they've been good so far, and we're very optimistic about continuing to pursue this program over the next several years. 
With respect to the ROI on the program and just the unit-level economics for Bath & Body Works, frankly, they're just outstanding. They're very solid. That said, as you can see in our information that we share externally, the fleet is actively managed. So even at Bath & Body Works, we close a few stores every year, and we're also opening stores as well. We're expanding square footage modestly or, I think, carefully. But the fleet is in great shape. And the most important thing about that remodel program is, in addition to the financial profile almost immediately being strong, it really sets the business up very well for the next 7 to 10 years with a very current store design that consumers respond well to. So we won't be in what some retailers can get into, which is a kind of a deferred CapEx situation. So it's a very good outcome for the business."

With respect to China, it's a multiyear situation, Ike. We do have some flagship stores there that play an important role in marketing the business, but they are generating some losses.

Thanks, Susan. So I think as you would know, but it's important just to reiterate, the most important thing we've done in the digital business is a project that we went live with in the last few months, which was a replatforming -- a full replatforming of victoriassecret.com. It had been running on systems and hardware that were more than 25 years old. And it served that legacy system, homegrown system, by the way, served the business very, very well for a long time. But it was time to upgrade that platform, which is a big deal obviously in terms of getting that right and doing it well. And again, the business -- the domestic business has been running on that new platform now for a couple of months. So that's the most important thing. It will enable us to pursue a number of customer-facing benefits that we're now moving forward to. And those would be things like buy online, pick up in store. 
Another foundational element that we're working on now before we roll with buy online, pickup in store and other similar things is we want to make sure that we have appropriate accuracy in our inventory. And obviously, we have that for financial statement purposes, but I'm talking about at the item level at a specific location on a particular day. And with a very broad assortment, with so many choices in the broad business, particularly at Victoria's, that inventory accuracy is critical, which is why we're in 2019 pursuing on RFID initiative and rolling out an RFID initiative for Victoria's Secret. So with the foundation of the new domestic -- what we call the domestic order management system and accurate inventories that are sufficient to make reasonable promises to customers, we will be able to do a lot of things that many other retailers can do today. 
One of the other things that the new system allows us to do is to have a broader distribution network for Victoria's in the United States, which will allow us to add capacity and have more flexibility with capacity. So that's another benefit that we're getting now. So that's the biggest thing that -- those are the biggest things, I should say, that we've been working on. 
Bath & Body, as you know, it wasn't implicit in your question, has a terrific online business in addition to Victoria's growing at a very healthy rate. And they're regularly looking at ways to upgrade the customer experience in that part of the business as well. Thanks."

And just -- I'm again speaking about the last year, 1.5 years, and okay results in the fine fragrance business. 
As we -- with that said, as we look at very recent results -- and they just had their most successful, what they would call, sister launch in fine fragrance over the last few weeks. So Greg and his team recognize the opportunity in the fine fragrance business. As -- you've followed us a long time. As you know, they've got 3 or 4 of the top 20 fine fragrances literally in the industry, which is a terrific place to be. 
In addition to continued work on the assortment itself, Greg is very focused and team very focused on improving the selling within our stores. And so we've got a number of things going on that we think will move the business in a favorable way and should represent a lot of upside in what is already a very sound business. 
With respect to the CapEx, you recognize that in the formation of your question, we have pulled back on CapEx for -- store-related CapEx, real estate-related CapEx for Victoria's Secret and international. And as was mentioned in an earlier question, we continue to invest in technology particularly pointed towards the online or digital part of our business. And we are also investing some in distribution and fulfillment assets as well. And so that's tilting the mix a bit from what it had typically been, again, representing some pullback in store-related driven by Victoria's and international just based on current trend, results, performance. But we're trying to maintain, if not increase, our investment in the online digital part of our business and again some work in distribution logistics as well. Thanks."

Just with more volatility in the wake of the trade tensions, and it sounds like you're making some changes on the supplier side, can you speak to how your ability to chase product on the PINK and VS side is evolving into the back half?

So the last part of that question, we're essentially almost fully open for the fourth quarter in terms of open-to-buy. So take that part of it first. 
And then with respect to speed and agility in the supply chain, it's been -- it's a legacy part of our business in a positive way. It's something that less focused on as long ago as the late '70s and early '80s. And we renewed our work in that area beginning now 7 or 8 years ago, both on the apparel -- the intimate apparel side of the business and in the personal care and beauty side of the business. So it's something we have renewed our capabilities in. And today, we would judge our capabilities in that area in terms of speed and agility in our supply chain as among the best in retailing based on what we know. 
With respect to the use of airfreight, frankly, substantially everything that we have produced outside the United States is on an airplane, other than some gift and accessory business. And it's because the value in our judgment of speed and agility, the question you're asking about, the economic value of that far outstrips the incremental cost of moving stuff on a boat. And as we like to say around here, ""You can't sell it if it's on a boat, by the way."" So our agility is good. And our standard model, if you will, with respect to things that are produced outside of the United States is, in fact, to move it by air. So the speed part of the businesses are fundamental, as we see it, and we're in good shape."

So in terms of targeted versus broad-based promos, Omar, we continue to pursue the right balance between those 2 things. And the considerations in that is if you have a very broad-based promo, then you're essentially discounting the whole assortment, if you will, if it's very broad-based. I'm exaggerating a little bit to make a point. Whereas if you have targeted promos, obviously, you're not discounting large portions of the entire assortment, and you can get more full-price selling on particularly strong choices within the assortment. 
And the balance point, which you recognize in the question, is that it tends to be that the broader-based promotions drive more consumer response and more traffic in an overall sense. So we're trying to strike that balance. The variable that's different from a year or 2 ago, and this is what makes the business interesting and fun, particularly when you largely figure it out, is that the assortment's different. So you could look at a promotional strategy in isolation and say, ""Hey, didn't I try this a few years ago, and it didn't work? So like what are they thinking, right?"" I'm again trying to make a point. But the dynamic has to include an evaluation of the strength of the assortment. It all starts with that. And with the work that Amy and John have been doing, we're optimistic that we can get reasonable result without having to do a substantial number of broad-based promotions. 
All that said, we've got a lot of flexibility there. And we will continue to test and learn and make trade-offs. And we'll be reevaluating the promotional strategy as we move through the fall season to get to the right customer response, get the right traffic, get the right margin dollars to work hard to deliver the results that are embedded in the forecast. 
The second part of the question was about trends within the months. So June was the strongest of the months, as I recall, and July was the weakest of the months, Omar, in the quarter -- second quarter for Victoria's, yes."

So with respect to an evaluation of good, better, best pricing and opportunities in the lingerie part of Victoria's, it's one of the most fundamental things that any merchant leader in any retail leadership team would evaluate. And so John has made that assessment for Victoria's Secret Lingerie. And the number of offerings at the better and best price points for Victoria's Secret Lingerie is up meaningfully versus what it had been. And that's based on -- if you've seen the merchandise online or in stores, you would see more sophisticated merchandise with a lot more, we believe, emotional content. And as we talked about at the start of the call, initial response from consumers to those new offerings has been good. 
The other aspect of what John and Amy have done is to have a clearer demarcation between the Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK businesses. Again, PINK is targeted towards a college-aged customer, and lingerie, more typically, somebody that would be postcollege and at higher price points and with a greater degree of sophistication. So that's another aspect of the good, better, best pricing work that both leaders have done to properly segment and position their respective businesses."

With that said, we've had a lot of sales pressure and margin rate pressure in the business. We have taken what I'd call targeted actions to reduce expenses in connection with a lot of the change at Victoria's Secret. In 2016 and 2017, we have -- we took substantial home office cost reductions. And in more recent periods, over the last year to 18 months, we've taken a lot of expense out of the business in terms of variable expenses in selling -- certain selling areas and in marketing as examples. But there's always more that you can do, but it comes with trade-offs. And you've got to be thoughtful about not getting into an ongoing cost-cutting exercise that can hurt the near-term and longer-term prospects for the business. 
So we're trying to strike the right balance, and we'll continue to monitor that as time progresses. If retail selling trends don't improve, margin trends don't improve at Victoria's Secret, you would expect us to take another hard fundamental look at expenses. And what we're focused on to the greatest extent right now is getting the results at retail in terms of sales and margin.

I'm really -- I'm trying to reconcile the guidance for inventories to be up in the mid-teens with the comp items that you baked in for fourth quarter and, I guess, merch margins planned to be down a little bit. But since I know a lot of the year, a lot of the annual earnings happens in the fourth quarter, I'm trying to think about how much room you might have left for yourself given what we've heard so far in second quarter is a fairly volatile outlook for the rest of the year as far as where the peer group's promotional levels will be for the holiday."

So a couple of thoughts in reaction to your question or in response to your question. The first is, in the lingerie part of Victoria's particularly, the -- what we would call the initial markup or the inherent markup in the goods is substantially greater than what it had been. And so that provides the opportunity for higher-margin rate results and more flexibility or room, if needed, to promote the business. Again, that's not our going-in plan, but as we've talked about, we needed to balance volume with rate. And again, the point I'm trying to register is there's higher markup in the goods in terms of their initial retails and their costs. So that gives us more flexibility than we've had over the last few years. 
With respect to the promotional environment, there are others in the industry and in our company that have been doing this longer than I have, and I've been doing it for a while. And going into every holiday, there's commentary about how it's going to be more promotional than ever. I am aware that we're in our 10th year of an economic recovery, and there's greater discussion understandably about the potential for a recession. But the truth is, absent a dramatic change in the environment like we saw in '08 and '09, we sell relatively affordable things. They are discretionary, but they're relatively affordable. And I would say, as a close-to-home data point, we look at Bath & Body's results in what folks might say is a promotional retail environment, and they're very strong results. And again, what those come from is a compelling brand position, a compelling merchandise assortment, well executed in the most complete sense. And we think that Victoria's has that opportunity. 
So there's nothing about the promotional environment per se that I would say is uniquely different versus most typical years. And it's really in our hands to deliver compelling assortments, again, well delivered in stores and online to get to a good result. And we have higher inherent markup to work with. Thanks."

As we noted in the commentary that we released last night, John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, respectively, have made significant changes to our fall assortments. The significant amount of change in our fall merchandise assortments and promotional plans as well as the current trade environment and tariff uncertainty inherently result in a greater level of uncertainty in forecasting our results for the third and fourth quarters than is typical. That said, we believe the customers will react positively to our new merchandise. And therefore, as we said consistently, we have assumed in our guidance that Victoria's Secret trends will improve versus recent performance and that Bath & Body Works will continue to deliver strong results. You'll hear more from John and Amy as well as other business leaders at our Investor Day, which is scheduled for September 10. 
Thanks, and over to you, Amie."

So as it relates to the new lingerie assortment, modern lingerie, as we refer to it, and initial results as we provided commentary in our pre-released remarks, the consumer reaction, Kimberly, to the new assortment and the new items in the assortment has been favorable and positive and consumers reacting well. 
But as you point out in your question, and it -- and all I can report to you is what we've observed so far and how things will progress as we see it based on what we believe for fall, the reaction to the new stuff has been very good. With that said, it hasn't been to date sufficient to overcome weakness in the balance of the lingerie assortment, including the effect of heavy promotions from a year ago that will continue through the fall season. Importantly, there will be additional new merchandise flowing through the fall season. So the full fall assortment was not in stores in the first few weeks of August, so we are reading a partial result. 
Additionally, we are very optimistic about our offering and the potential for growth in the sleep and lounge business that, as you appreciate, SKUs in terms of its proportion to the total to a greater percentage of that total as we move through the fall season, given its giftability and just general seasonality for sleep and lounge, we've got more work that we're doing on marketing. And we believe that our marketing effectiveness will improve as we move through the fall season. 
So qualitatively, that would be the additional perspective that we have in answer to your question. So consumer reaction, again, strong and favorable to the new offerings yet not sufficient to deliver an overall result that changes the trend so far, more new merchandise flowing through the balance of fall and a lot of work going on in marketing to more effectively market the changes and drive traffic in the stores. Thanks."

We made that decision relatively late in 2018 into early 2019. So our reentry into that business happened in the latter part of March, as I recall it. So we missed a little bit of the natural season for swim. It generated, in round numbers, about $30 million of volume, $40 million of volume versus what it had been in the past. We do believe that there is substantial additional growth opportunity in swim. Our focus, as we've conveyed previously, is to pursue that business online and generally with a more elevated assortment than what we had offered in the past. And consumer reaction to that, while there was a little bit of commentary out there about price points, overall, the reaction to what we put in front of customers was positive. So it was a good start particularly given the timing of our decision. There is meaningful additional growth opportunity in that category. Again, I'm repeating, but I'm trying to make sure I'm being clear. We intend to pursue that at this time online and not in stores. 
With respect to lingerie inventory, the first thing, Paul, I'd want to register, and you know this having followed us for a long, long time, is that we're working very hard to maintain a lot -- as much flexibility as possible, particularly for the fourth quarter, and through our focus on reducing lead times and ordering frequently and adjusting regularly. John Mehas and his team are working the assortment literally almost every week in terms of adjusting the on-order. We are making important investments in the new parts of the assortment. And with that said, we've got a lot of flexibility in particular for the fourth quarter to read and react to the overall trend and to adjust the on-order obviously to maximize our chase and pursuit of the items that are doing best and to cancel or adjust out of items that aren't doing as well. 
So we're making important investments. Again, optimistic in terms of the reaction to the new offering certainly in total, and we got a lot of flexibility. Was there a third part to Paul's question?"

And that's an all-in definition, including GWPs and all forms of marketing. The most important thing I would want to register about marketing, and we've been pretty consistent in this mindset now for as long as maybe 12 months, certainly 6 to 9 months, is that everything is on the table. And what's meant by that is we're taking a fresh hard look at almost every material aspect of our business. 
And the reason you're asking about marketing for Victoria's is it's an important part of that business. So in terms of the messaging, the imagery, the photography, the words, the pricing, promotional aspects of it, the medium of communication, the integration of marketing between stores and digital and social channels, John is getting more and more involved in it. He spent his initial focus on the merchandise because that is the longest lead-time item in the business, and he's done substantial work in that space, frankly, extraordinary amounts of work in terms of change in a short period of time since he joined us. And he's now shifting his time -- not to the exclusion of merchandising. That's a core ongoing responsibility obviously, but he's getting more and more involved in marketing. 
You've read that we've had changes in senior leadership in marketing. And I expect that there will be meaningful and hopefully thoughtful change in our marketing approach as we move through fall and into 2020. John will comment further on that, I would expect, when we're together in September."

So in terms of the traffic at Bath & Body Works in the second quarter, it was about flat, store-level traffic flat year-on-year. And the growth in the business came through transaction increases driven by conversion. 
With respect to the refresh program, as we've commented on consistently and updated in our script, we're very pleased with the results of it. The refresh activity has not been limited to A malls but has also happened in other mall tiers. We are seeing strong results in almost every situation. Whether it's an A or a B mall or a C mall or an outlet center, we're seeing strong results broad-based, very, very few exceptions to that. And we'll keep pursuing the program. Obviously, as we move down into the fleet, we'll continue to watch the ROIs. But again, they've been good so far, and we're very optimistic about continuing to pursue this program over the next several years. 
With respect to the ROI on the program and just the unit-level economics for Bath & Body Works, frankly, they're just outstanding. They're very solid. That said, as you can see in our information that we share externally, the fleet is actively managed. So even at Bath & Body Works, we close a few stores every year, and we're also opening stores as well. We're expanding square footage modestly or, I think, carefully. But the fleet is in great shape. And the most important thing about that remodel program is, in addition to the financial profile almost immediately being strong, it really sets the business up very well for the next 7 to 10 years with a very current store design that consumers respond well to. So we won't be in what some retailers can get into, which is a kind of a deferred CapEx situation. So it's a very good outcome for the business."

With respect to China, it's a multiyear situation, Ike. We do have some flagship stores there that play an important role in marketing the business, but they are generating some losses.

Thanks, Susan. So I think as you would know, but it's important just to reiterate, the most important thing we've done in the digital business is a project that we went live with in the last few months, which was a replatforming -- a full replatforming of victoriassecret.com. It had been running on systems and hardware that were more than 25 years old. And it served that legacy system, homegrown system, by the way, served the business very, very well for a long time. But it was time to upgrade that platform, which is a big deal obviously in terms of getting that right and doing it well. And again, the business -- the domestic business has been running on that new platform now for a couple of months. So that's the most important thing. It will enable us to pursue a number of customer-facing benefits that we're now moving forward to. And those would be things like buy online, pick up in store. 
Another foundational element that we're working on now before we roll with buy online, pickup in store and other similar things is we want to make sure that we have appropriate accuracy in our inventory. And obviously, we have that for financial statement purposes, but I'm talking about at the item level at a specific location on a particular day. And with a very broad assortment, with so many choices in the broad business, particularly at Victoria's, that inventory accuracy is critical, which is why we're in 2019 pursuing on RFID initiative and rolling out an RFID initiative for Victoria's Secret. So with the foundation of the new domestic -- what we call the domestic order management system and accurate inventories that are sufficient to make reasonable promises to customers, we will be able to do a lot of things that many other retailers can do today. 
One of the other things that the new system allows us to do is to have a broader distribution network for Victoria's in the United States, which will allow us to add capacity and have more flexibility with capacity. So that's another benefit that we're getting now. So that's the biggest thing that -- those are the biggest things, I should say, that we've been working on. 
Bath & Body, as you know, it wasn't implicit in your question, has a terrific online business in addition to Victoria's growing at a very healthy rate. And they're regularly looking at ways to upgrade the customer experience in that part of the business as well. Thanks."

So Greg and his team recognize the opportunity in the fine fragrance business. As -- you've followed us a long time. As you know, they've got 3 or 4 of the top 20 fine fragrances literally in the industry, which is a terrific place to be. 
In addition to continued work on the assortment itself, Greg is very focused and team very focused on improving the selling within our stores. And so we've got a number of things going on that we think will move the business in a favorable way and should represent a lot of upside in what is already a very sound business. 
With respect to the CapEx, you recognize that in the formation of your question, we have pulled back on CapEx for -- store-related CapEx, real estate-related CapEx for Victoria's Secret and international. And as was mentioned in an earlier question, we continue to invest in technology particularly pointed towards the online or digital part of our business.

Just with more volatility in the wake of the trade tensions, and it sounds like you're making some changes on the supplier side, can you speak to how your ability to chase product on the PINK and VS side is evolving into the back half?

And then with respect to speed and agility in the supply chain, it's been -- it's a legacy part of our business in a positive way. It's something that less focused on as long ago as the late '70s and early '80s. And we renewed our work in that area beginning now 7 or 8 years ago, both on the apparel -- the intimate apparel side of the business and in the personal care and beauty side of the business. So it's something we have renewed our capabilities in. And today, we would judge our capabilities in that area in terms of speed and agility in our supply chain as among the best in retailing based on what we know. 
With respect to the use of airfreight, frankly, substantially everything that we have produced outside the United States is on an airplane, other than some gift and accessory business. And it's because the value in our judgment of speed and agility, the question you're asking about, the economic value of that far outstrips the incremental cost of moving stuff on a boat. And as we like to say around here, ""You can't sell it if it's on a boat, by the way."" So our agility is good. And our standard model, if you will, with respect to things that are produced outside of the United States is, in fact, to move it by air. So the speed part of the businesses are fundamental, as we see it, and we're in good shape."

So in terms of targeted versus broad-based promos, Omar, we continue to pursue the right balance between those 2 things. And the considerations in that is if you have a very broad-based promo, then you're essentially discounting the whole assortment, if you will, if it's very broad-based. I'm exaggerating a little bit to make a point. Whereas if you have targeted promos, obviously, you're not discounting large portions of the entire assortment, and you can get more full-price selling on particularly strong choices within the assortment. 
And the balance point, which you recognize in the question, is that it tends to be that the broader-based promotions drive more consumer response and more traffic in an overall sense. So we're trying to strike that balance. The variable that's different from a year or 2 ago, and this is what makes the business interesting and fun, particularly when you largely figure it out, is that the assortment's different. So you could look at a promotional strategy in isolation and say, ""Hey, didn't I try this a few years ago, and it didn't work? So like what are they thinking, right?"" I'm again trying to make a point. But the dynamic has to include an evaluation of the strength of the assortment. It all starts with that. And with the work that Amy and John have been doing, we're optimistic that we can get reasonable result without having to do a substantial number of broad-based promotions. 
All that said, we've got a lot of flexibility there. And we will continue to test and learn and make trade-offs. And we'll be reevaluating the promotional strategy as we move through the fall season to get to the right customer response, get the right traffic, get the right margin dollars to work hard to deliver the results that are embedded in the forecast. 
The second part of the question was about trends within the months. So June was the strongest of the months, as I recall, and July was the weakest of the months, Omar, in the quarter -- second quarter for Victoria's, yes."

So with respect to an evaluation of good, better, best pricing and opportunities in the lingerie part of Victoria's, it's one of the most fundamental things that any merchant leader in any retail leadership team would evaluate. And so John has made that assessment for Victoria's Secret Lingerie. And the number of offerings at the better and best price points for Victoria's Secret Lingerie is up meaningfully versus what it had been. And that's based on -- if you've seen the merchandise online or in stores, you would see more sophisticated merchandise with a lot more, we believe, emotional content. And as we talked about at the start of the call, initial response from consumers to those new offerings has been good. 
The other aspect of what John and Amy have done is to have a clearer demarcation between the Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK businesses. Again, PINK is targeted towards a college-aged customer, and lingerie, more typically, somebody that would be postcollege and at higher price points and with a greater degree of sophistication. So that's another aspect of the good, better, best pricing work that both leaders have done to properly segment and position their respective businesses."

With that said, we've had a lot of sales pressure and margin rate pressure in the business. We have taken what I'd call targeted actions to reduce expenses in connection with a lot of the change at Victoria's Secret. In 2016 and 2017, we have -- we took substantial home office cost reductions. And in more recent periods, over the last year to 18 months, we've taken a lot of expense out of the business in terms of variable expenses in selling -- certain selling areas and in marketing as examples. But there's always more that you can do, but it comes with trade-offs. And you've got to be thoughtful about not getting into an ongoing cost-cutting exercise that can hurt the near-term and longer-term prospects for the business. 
So we're trying to strike the right balance, and we'll continue to monitor that as time progresses. If retail selling trends don't improve, margin trends don't improve at Victoria's Secret, you would expect us to take another hard fundamental look at expenses.

But since I know a lot of the year, a lot of the annual earnings happens in the fourth quarter, I'm trying to think about how much room you might have left for yourself given what we've heard so far in second quarter is a fairly volatile outlook for the rest of the year as far as where the peer group's promotional levels will be for the holiday."

So a couple of thoughts in reaction to your question or in response to your question. The first is, in the lingerie part of Victoria's particularly, the -- what we would call the initial markup or the inherent markup in the goods is substantially greater than what it had been. And so that provides the opportunity for higher-margin rate results and more flexibility or room, if needed, to promote the business. Again, that's not our going-in plan, but as we've talked about, we needed to balance volume with rate. And again, the point I'm trying to register is there's higher markup in the goods in terms of their initial retails and their costs. So that gives us more flexibility than we've had over the last few years. 
With respect to the promotional environment, there are others in the industry and in our company that have been doing this longer than I have, and I've been doing it for a while. And going into every holiday, there's commentary about how it's going to be more promotional than ever. I am aware that we're in our 10th year of an economic recovery, and there's greater discussion understandably about the potential for a recession. But the truth is, absent a dramatic change in the environment like we saw in '08 and '09, we sell relatively affordable things. They are discretionary, but they're relatively affordable. And I would say, as a close-to-home data point, we look at Bath & Body's results in what folks might say is a promotional retail environment, and they're very strong results. And again, what those come from is a compelling brand position, a compelling merchandise assortment, well executed in the most complete sense. And we think that Victoria's has that opportunity. 
So there's nothing about the promotional environment per se that I would say is uniquely different versus most typical years. And it's really in our hands to deliver compelling assortments, again, well delivered in stores and online to get to a good result. And we have higher inherent markup to work with. Thanks."

We're about as urgent as we could be. And what the merchant leaders are focused on, John and Amy, is improving the merchandise offerings and then, again, executing those well in terms of all of the aspects of delivering that well to consumers in stores and online. We're aware of the time frame under which the Victoria's segment has had year-on-year declines in sales. It started in 2016, so this has been a multiyear situation. 
With that said, we think that the assets that the business has in terms of brand awareness, brand regard, footfall in stores, visits online, sourcing and logistics capabilities, strong management certainly on an overall basis, that there's a lot of assets that this business has that, when well led and executed, we believe we're going to make substantial progress this fall and that there's a lot of opportunity for this business over the next several years. So -- and we're pursuing all that, trust me, with a lot of urgency. Thanks."

Our third quarter earnings per share result of $0.02 was in our forecasted range of between a loss of $0.05 and earnings of $0.05. Bath & Body Works exceeded our expectations for the quarter and continues to deliver strong results, with a 9% comp increase and a 10% increase in operating income. 
Outperformance at Bath & Body Works was offset by Victoria's Secret result that was at the low end of our expectations. Looking to the fourth quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share of about $2. New CEOs, John Mehas and Amy Hauk are very focused on getting close to our customers and making improvements to our merchandise assortments, marketing and customer experiences in stores and online. We have more work to do, and we recognize that it will take some time to see improvement in the business. Also, as mentioned earlier, we are up against aggressive promotions from last year and the time period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is 6 days shorter than last year. Therefore, our fourth quarter guidance assumes a Victoria's secret merchandise margin dollar decline in the high single-digit range, which is consistent with our third quarter result. We expect continued strong performance from Bath & Body Works. We're very focused on executing a successful holiday. We will continue to rely on the strength of our agility, and we will continue to test pricing and promotion strategies, react to customer preferences. And Chase into proven product winners to drive results. Thanks, and over to you, Amie."

Positioning for intimates in PINK, and the consumer has reacted well to that. And it's driving a strong overall result. With respect to improvements that the team is making in apparel and, particularly in the tops business. Obviously, there are adjustments happening. On an ongoing basis. There is some strength in the apparel assortment, as was called out in our pre-circulated remarks. The business will continue to advance the assortment in the fourth quarter.

So there's some cross currents on the merchandise margin line with AUR being planned up with lingerie, but down at PINK, given the the different strategies there.

Just overall, how are you thinking about the balance of capturing your fair share of traffic during the competitive holiday period versus holding firm on the product and AUR elevation strategy?"

So in terms of the AUR positioning for lingerie and for PINK. It starts with a point of view that John and Amy communicated back at the Analyst Day in September, which is the businesses are going after different target customers. That are in different stages of their life and otherwise just have some distinction. And so as a result of that, as you know, John is pursuing, developing, pursuing offering more elevated products, more glamor, more fashion, a lot of emotional content. And over time, we expect that we'll get paid for that work through AUR and margin rates. Amy has and team have also done customer work, consumer work. And one of the things that they have assessed is that they really want to make sure that our offering to that customer, again, a younger customer. That the offerings are highly accessible from a pricing standpoint. So there's a natural delineation in average unit retails. As it relates to margin rate with the context I just provided. And over time or as a target. We would expect that both the businesses, including in the Bra business should earn healthy margin rates, consistent with those strategies. And so again, over time, I don't start with a point of view that the margin rates would necessarily be different between the 2. Again, the price levels are different. But I'm not sure that the margin rates would be different. Second part of your question was about promotion and how will we manage through the holiday period, given the significant promotions from a year ago. Obviously, we're trying to get paid for our work to have an appropriate amount of promotion, but there are a couple of things that I would just reinforce. One is we need to -- and we will, and inventories with a clean position, so that we start 2020 in a healthy inventory standpoint, both financially and numerically, and also in terms of the freshness and the quality of the assortment that we carry over into the spring season. So ensuring that, that happens, depending upon how things go. Obviously, will be an important input to the degree or level of promotion through the holiday period. The other is, as you recognize in your question, it's a key time for our consumers. We have a lot of traffic in our stores and online. And we'll be balancing promotional levels to drive volume, engagement with customers, profit in the management of inventory flow and sell downs. So we're not overly principled about it. We certainly are pursuing a strategy it paid for our work and to reduce the level of promotion, but it is dynamic. We do a lot of testing, as you're familiar with. And we'll try to strike the right balance considering the factors that I've mentioned."

There will be some pressure on units. But again, our intent in total would be to drive revenue growth as a result of these strategies."

So in terms of promotional approach, Oliver, segmentation, customer file. We engage with our customers in lots of way through lots of ways through e-mail, through direct traditional mail communication through social media, et cetera. We certainly employ different views of segmentation in each of those and other contact strategy. So we have done that historically. We obviously work to get better at that over time. In terms of our general views about promotion and promotion key periods, I would say, apart from not anniversary-ing some very significant intimate apparel promotions or at least going in, not expecting to anniversary some of those. Otherwise, I would say, our promotional strategy is largely consistent with the prior year with some evolution to fewer, simpler, more impactful offers. So that would be, I guess, the main point that I would want to register on promotion. And obviously, we utilize various segmentation approaches in our contact strategies. With respect to the store base part of our business. It's a critical part of our business, obviously, as we've registered very consistently now for many years, and I think was remarked on in our precirculated commentary. We opened a lot of stores every year and we close stores every year. And on a net basis, we have opened more stores than we've closed. And that is just the natural, proactive, healthy management of a multi-unit store base. We believe strongly in the relevance and the opportunities associated with the store-based business. And at the same time, as you also know, this is an either/or we have a very significant online business at both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's secret. So we're pursuing appropriate growth and customer experiences in both channels. We actively manage our real estate. The real estate outcomes are a function of overall business performance. So obviously, we pulled back on investment in the Victoria's business over the last 2 or 3 years, given its overall performance. And conversely, we've increased our investment in Bath & Body over the last 5 or 6 years, given the quality of overall result and the specific results that we get from remodeling stores or opening new stores that include the White Barn shop-in-shop treatment or over white Barn store design, as we refer to it. So it's dynamic. But overall, we're a strong believer in the store-based part of our business. We're making important investments in it, where there's a result, and we proactively manage it."

And with regard to the core lingerie business, it seems at least like the initial reception to the new strategic direction that John has laid out has not been received well. So I'm wondering if he is course correcting, understanding that he hasn't affected the full assortment at this point. Just the initial flows that came in, in the third quarter.

So on PINK, Kimberly, we've recognized in the question, the progress made in the intimate apparel side of the business,  bras and panties and the overall sequential trend improvement, still not where we want it to be margin dollars in the third quarter for PINK overall were down, but up in  bras and panties. And down in the apparel categories, driven by tops, as mentioned, in terms of what is Amy doing about that. She and her team are leveraging our testing and speed and agility capabilities to provide more new offerings to the consumer in that space, and also doing more work in sport and seamless and outfitting with respect to sport and seamless in that part of the apparel part of the business. So it's not just how do we go back and try to do what we've done historically better, but rather really mining for, including a real emphasis on sport and seamless, what is the new positioning for apparel and, particularly apparel tops in PINK, again, leveraging our design and fast supply chain capabilities that the business has. So our work in process, some signs of success, but the overall result, not what we want it to be in apparel, and it's a big part of the business, as you appreciate. So the team is very focused on it. But it's right to be curious about it. The team very, very focused on continued improvement in that part of the business. With respect to an assessment of Victoria's Secret Lingerie and the initial offerings of that John has introduced into the assortment. I really believe it's substantially too early to come to any conclusion on it, and I'll elaborate on that. There certainly are offerings that have been introduced into the assortment that have had strong positive customer response, meaning new stuff, customer bought a lot of it indication that glamor and elevation and product at higher price points when executed well get a strong customer response. Examples of that, more specifically, would include the matchback panty categories that come at substantially higher AURs, and then have a real fashion content to them. Along with sexy sleep and lounge offerings that have gotten a strong customer response. 
All that said, Kimberly, the progress and it's why you're asking your question, the progress made those examples being provided has not been sufficient to overcome the year-on-year declines in other very significant categories within the intimate apparel and sleep and loungewear businesses. So we're very clear minded about where we are on an overall basis, with a lot more work to do. John is working smart and very hard building a new team, focused on improving execution in stores and online, along with some evolution on the marketing of the business. And there are signs of progress, for sure. But as again, commented on in our pre-released information, lapping a lot of promotion. And some weakness in legacy core frames that are big books of business. And what's happening there, as you would expect us to be doing is a lot of development work where we think we will have significant relaunch activity in 2020 in some of those early 2020 in some of those core frames that are big books of business that have meaningful year-on-year declines that we're not able to overcome with the progress we're seeing in some of the new items introduced. So that would be my overview of it. This is a business that's had challenges, lingerie now for 3 or 4 years. And it's going to take some time to stabilize it and get it back to where it should be. I absolutely believe John and his team are working on the right stuff, signs of progress, but it's going to take some time. And all that said, shouldn't be interpreted as any sense of complacency or we'll get to it when we get to it, the team couldn't be working harder and with more energy to get the results that we're all looking for."

So it's a booking of a noncash reserve for potential cash exposure that we may have in future periods. Related to, again, leases and credit support associated with sourcing. So that's what that is about. With respect to Carla, our leverage and credit ratings. As we announced a year ago. The company is taking steps to reduce its leverage. We made a bit of progress in terms of debt reduction this year. And those steps include reductions of capital expenditures. We made a change in the dividend announced a year ago, taking effect in January that freed up a bit more than $300 million. So management with the board will continue to evaluate those things. The most important aspect of any of that is improving the cash flow of the business, which is associated with, as you appreciate, the operating improvements that we're pursuing in lingerie and PINK particularly. But at the end of the day, we have -- we expect to end the year with about $1.4 billion of cash. We generate significant free cash flow. Our debt maturity profile is healthy and well spaced out. And so those are all aspects of our capital structure that certainly we consider and any outside party would naturally consider."

As a general matter, the answer to that question is no.

The first thing I would say, Paul, and again, it may seem my problem, but I think it's important because it's really important is an operating income rate for Bath & Body Works. In the low 20s. We believe, believes, that the business believes is appropriate. And the business has consistently delivered very healthy top line growth and very healthy bottom line growth with a little bit of deleverage in the rate over the last few years, largely reflecting the impact on depreciation and occupancy of the White Barn Remodel program that we believe is a very positive thing for the business. So that's the overarching point. With respect to movement in the merchandise margin rate, 3 or 4 things to know. There is some inflation in the supply chain. There is some impact of tariffs. There is some impact of channel shift given the outpacing growth is very dramatic and healthy, frankly, remarkable growth. In the direct side of that business, where the merchandise margin rate profile is a little different than the store profile. Again, that channel very profitable at the bottom line, but the geography of rate different. So that puts a little pressure on things. And promotion is up slightly and largely due to consumers responding in a very significant way when the business does offer promotion versus the business offering a lot more promotion in terms of days or depth. So that really is, Paul, the big picture on the margin architecture for Bath & Body, and that's how we think about it, and that's certainly what we would hope investors would appreciate and understand. And then separately, on the management of expenses, the team, Nick, Andrew Meslow, the management team at Bath & Body is, frankly, extraordinary at balancing expense management in the business. So investing in things where it makes sense and being top minded and disciplined where it doesn't. So not just cutting ours and having bad customer experiences that the business offers terrific experiences for consumers. The business invest in product quality, et cetera. So the expense management and the business, the inventory discipline in the business is very, very strong, and those capabilities, that mindset, that stability in that management team is really what drives the overall result. With respect to the impairment and what geographies were included in the impairment. China was the greatest amount of impairment, but there was also Paul impairment. We impaired stores, and there was a charge associated with the U.K. and Ireland. And a little -- and some in the United States as well. But China was the biggest component, followed by the U.K. and Ireland, and then a little bit more in the United States beyond the impairments we took a year ago. And answer your question, does it save depreciation? Yes, it does. And that's not -- some people think that's why you take impairments. That's it's actually a required accounting evaluation. So it's not to save depreciation, but in fact, it does have the result of reducing depreciation in forward periods. Obviously, Paul, part of the China evaluation relates to our business in Hong Kong. So circumstances there, as you would appreciate."

Our third quarter earnings per share result of $0.02 was within our forecasted range of between a loss of $0.05 and earnings of $0.05. Bath & Body Works exceeded our expectations for the quarter and continues to deliver strong results, with a 9% comp increase and a 10% increase in operating income. 
Outperformance at Bath & Body Works was offset by Victoria's Secret result that was at the low end of our expectations. Looking to the fourth quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share of about $2. New CEOs, John Mehas and Amy Hauk are very focused on getting close to our customers and making improvements to our merchandise assortments, marketing and customer experiences in stores and online. We have more work to do, and we recognize that it will take some time to see improvement in the business. 
Also, as mentioned earlier, we are up against aggressive promotions from last year and the time period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is 6 days shorter than last year. Therefore, our fourth quarter guidance assumes a Victoria's Secret merchandise margin dollar decline in the high single-digit range, which is consistent with our third quarter result. We expect continued strong performance from Bath & Body Works. 
We're very focused on executing a successful holiday. We will continue to rely on the strength of our agility, and we will continue to test pricing and promotion strategies, react to customer preferences. And Chase into proven product winners to drive results. Thanks, and over to you, Amie."

So in terms of the PINK results in intimates. Amy and her team have made product improvements and have also developed an assortment architecture that has very sharp price points that make the intimate offerings very accessible to the PINK consumer. So very strong unit growth results, a strong sales result. Again, a rebalancing of the mix there to really distort to sharp price points and highly accessible from a retail price positioning for intimates in PINK, and the consumer has reacted well to that. And it's driving a strong overall result. 
With respect to improvements that the team is making in apparel and, particularly in the tops business, obviously, there are adjustments happening on an ongoing basis. There is some strength in the apparel assortment, as was called out in our pre-circulated remarks. The business will continue to advance the assortment in the fourth quarter. But as you recognize in your question, more to come in 2020, in terms of change in the assortment -- the apparel assortment to drive the results we're looking for there. Thanks."

So there are some cross-currents on the merchandise margin line with AUR being planned up with lingerie, but down at PINK, given the different strategies there. To the extent that you hit your plans for each division. How should we think about kind of the net impact on merchandise margin in the near term? 
And then kind of separately, you cautioned that VS lingerie is up against a heavier promotional period from last year. Just overall, how are you thinking about the balance of capturing your fair share of traffic during the competitive holiday period versus holding firm on the product and AUR elevation strategy?"

So in terms of the AUR positioning for lingerie and for PINK, it starts with a point of view that John and Amy communicated back at the Analyst Day in September, which is the businesses are going after different target customers. That are in different stages of their life and otherwise just have some distinction. And so as a result of that, as you know, John is pursuing developing, pursuing offering more elevated products, more glamor, more fashion, a lot of emotional content. And over time, we expect that we'll get paid for that work through AUR and margin rates. Amy has and team have also done customer work, consumer work. And one of the things that they have assessed is that they really want to make sure that our offerings to that customer, again, a younger customer, that the offerings are highly accessible from a pricing standpoint. So there's a natural delineation in average unit retails. 
As it relates to margin rate with the context I just provided and over time or as a target, we would expect that both of the businesses, including in the bra business should earn healthy margin rates, consistent with those strategies. And so again, over time, I don't start with a point of view that the margin rates would necessarily be different between the 2. Again, the price levels are different. But I'm not sure that the margin rates would be different. 
Second part of your question was about promotion and how will we manage through the holiday period, given the significant promotions from a year ago. Obviously, we're trying to get paid for our work to have an appropriate amount of promotion, but there are a couple of things that I would just reinforce. One is we need to -- and we will, and inventories with a clean position, so that we start 2020 in a healthy inventory standpoint, both financially and numerically, and also in terms of the freshness and the quality of the assortment that we carry over into the spring season. So ensuring that, that happens, depending upon how things go, obviously, we'll be an important input to the degree or level of promotion through the holiday period. 
The other is, as you recognize in your question, it's a key time for our consumers. We have a lot of traffic in our stores and online. And we'll be balancing promotional levels to drive volume, engagement with customers, profit -- again the management of inventory flow and sell downs. So we're not overly principled about it. We certainly are pursuing a strategy it paid for our work and to reduce the level of promotion, but it is dynamic. We do a lot of testing, as you're familiar with. And we'll try to strike the right balance considering the factors that I've mentioned. Thanks."

With respect to pricing in panties and apparel for lingerie, John is also in those categories, given the quality of the brand and what we believe is our opportunity in offering differentiated merchandise that has significantly more emotional content. He's shifting the panty business to include a lot more single ticket panties that are matched back panties that come at higher average unit retails. And separately in the sleep and lounge business, a significant investment in the product in terms of quality of fabrics, hand feel, quality of fashion and design aesthetic.

So in terms of promotional approach, Oliver, segmentation, customer file. We engage with our customers in lots of ways -- lots of ways through e-mail, through direct traditional mail communication, through social media, et cetera. We certainly employ different views of segmentation in each of those and other contact strategy. So we have done that historically, we obviously work to get better at that over time. 
In terms of our general views about promotion and promotion in key periods, I would say, apart from not anniversarying some very significant intimate apparel promotions or at least going in, not expecting to anniversary some of those. Otherwise, I would say, our promotional strategy is largely consistent with the prior year with some evolution to fewer, simpler, more impactful offers. So that would be, I guess, the main point that I would want to register on promotion. And obviously, we utilize various segmentation approaches in our contact strategies. 
With respect to the store base part of our business. It's a critical part of our business, obviously, as we've registered very consistently now for many years, and I think was remarked on in our pre-circulated commentary, we opened a lot of stores every year and we close stores every year. And on a net basis, we have opened more stores than we've closed. And that is just the natural, proactive, healthy management of a multi-unit store base. 
We believe strongly in relevance and the opportunities associated with the store-based business. And at the same time, as you also know, this isn't either/or, we have a very significant online business at both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. So we're pursuing appropriate growth and customer experiences in both channels. We actively manage our real estate. The real estate outcomes are a function of overall business performance. So obviously, we've pulled back on investment in the Victoria's business over the last 2 or 3 years, given its overall performance. And conversely, we've increased our investment in Bath & Body over the last 5 or 6 years, given the quality of overall result and the specific results that we get from remodeling stores or opening new stores that include the White Barn shop-in-shop treatment or over White Barn store design, as we refer to it. So it's dynamic, but overall, we're a strong believer in the store-based part of our business. We're making important investments in it, where there's a result, and we proactively manage it. Thank you."

It seems like merchandise margin also got better relative to the second quarter. And the last piece is the tops business, it seems like that needs to turn. So I'm wondering if you can talk about Amy's strategies in tops. And with regard to the core lingerie business, it seems at least like the initial reception to the new strategic direction that John has laid out has not been received well. So I'm wondering if he is course-correcting, understanding that he hasn't affected the full assortment at this point. Just the sort of initial flows that came in, in the third quarter. It just -- it doesn't seem like the reception that has been favorable. So I'm wondering what sort of course- correcting measures he might be taking?"
285544,599266374,1871570,"L Brands, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2019",2019-11-21,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So on PINK, Kimberly, we recognized in the question, the progress made in the intimate apparel side of the business, bras and panties and the overall sequential trend improvement, still not where we want it to be. Margin dollars in the third quarter",673,"Yes. So on PINK, Kimberly, we recognized in the question, the progress made in the intimate apparel side of the business, bras and panties and the overall sequential trend improvement, still not where we want it to be. Margin dollars in the third quarter for PINK overall were down, but up in bras and panties, and down in the apparel categories, driven by tops, as mentioned. 
In terms of what is Amy doing about that. She and her team are leveraging our testing and speed and agility capabilities to provide more new offerings to the consumer in that space. And also doing more work in sport and seamless and outfitting with respect to sport and seamless in that part of the apparel part of the business. So it's not just how do we go back and try to do what we've done historically better, but rather really mining for, including a real emphasis on sport and seamless, what is the new positioning for apparel and, particularly apparel tops in PINK, again, leveraging our design and fast supply chain capabilities that the business has. 
So a work in process, some signs of success, but the overall result, not what we want it to be in apparel, and it's a big part of the business, as you appreciate. So the team is very focused on it. But it's right to be curious about it, the team very, very focused on continued improvement in that part of the business. 
With respect to an assessment of Victoria's Secret Lingerie and the initial offerings of that John has introduced into the assortment, I really believe it's substantially too early to come to any conclusion on it, and I'll elaborate on that. There certainly are offerings that have been introduced into the assortment that have had strong positive customer response, meaning new stuff, customer bought a lot of it, indication that glamor and elevation and product at higher price points, when executed well, get a strong customer response. Examples of that, more specifically, would include the match-back panty categories that come at substantially higher AURs, and that have a real fashion content to them along with sexy sleep and lounge offerings that have gotten a strong customer response. 
All that said, Kimberly, the progress, since why you're asking your question, the progress made those examples being provided has not been sufficient to overcome the year-on-year declines in other very significant categories within the intimate apparel and sleep and loungewear businesses. So we're very clear minded about where we are on an overall basis, with a lot more work to do. John is working smart and very hard building a new team, focused on improving execution in stores and online, along with some evolution on the marketing of the business. 
And there are signs of progress, for sure. But as again, commented on in our pre-released information, lapping a lot of promotion. And some weakness in legacy core frames that are big books of business. And what's happening there, as you would expect us to be doing is a lot of development work where we think we will have significant relaunch activity in 2020 in some of those early 2020 in some of those core frames that are big books of business that have meaningful year-on-year declines that we're not able to overcome with the progress we're seeing in some of the new items introduced. So that would be my overview of it. This is a business that's had challenges, lingerie, now for 3 or 4 years. And it's going to take some time to stabilize it and get it back to where it should be. I absolutely believe John and his team are working on the right stuff, signs of progress, but it's going to take some time. And all that said, shouldn't be interpreted as any sense of complacency or we'll get to it when we get to it, the team couldn't be working harder and with more energy to get the results that we're all looking for."

So it's a booking of a noncash reserve for potential cash exposure that we may have in future periods. Related to, again, leases and credit support associated with sourcing. So that's what that is about. 
With respect to, Carla, our leverage and credit ratings, as we announced a year ago. The company is taking steps to reduce its leverage. We made a bit of progress in terms of debt reduction this year. And those steps include reductions of capital expenditures. We made a change in the dividend announced a year ago, taking effect in January that freed up a bit more than $300 million. So management with the board will continue to evaluate those things. The most important aspect of any of that is improving the cash flow of the business, which is associated with, as you appreciate, the operating improvements that we're pursuing in lingerie and PINK particularly. But at the end of the day, we have -- we expect to end the year with about $1.4 billion of cash. We generate significant free cash flow. Our debt maturity profile is healthy and well spaced out. And so those are all aspects of our capital structure that certainly we consider and any outside party would naturally consider."

In terms of -- in a granular way, specifically as timing over the years shifted in terms of the airing of the fashion show, did we see specific material impact on short-term sales response to the airing of the fashion show, as a general matter, the answer to that question is no. So if you're like, oh my God, Stuart, you freaked out about the day after the fashion show result and what's going to happen based on -- it did air at different times over the years, and we didn't see a material impact on the next few days results.

The first thing I would say, Paul, and again, it may seem my pabulum, but I think it's important because it's really important, is an operating income rate for Bath & Body Works. In the low 20s. We believe, Nick, believes, that the business believes",537,"Yes. The first thing I would say, Paul, and again, it may seem my pabulum, but I think it's important because it's really important, is an operating income rate for Bath & Body Works. In the low 20s. We believe, Nick, believes, that the business believes is appropriate. And the business has consistently delivered very healthy top line growth and very healthy bottom line growth with a little bit of deleverage in the rate over the last few years, largely reflecting the impact on depreciation and occupancy of the White Barn remodel program that we believe is a very positive thing for the business. So that's the overarching point. 
With respect to movement in the merchandise margin rate, 3 or 4 things to know. There is some inflation in the supply chain. There is some impact of tariffs. There is some impact of channel shift given the outpacing growth is very dramatic and healthy, frankly, remarkable growth. In the direct side of that business, where the merchandise margin rate profile is a little different than the store profile. Again, that channel very profitable at the bottom line, but the geography of rate different. So that puts a little pressure on things. And promotion is up slightly and largely due to consumers responding in a very significant way when the business does offer promotion versus the business offering a lot more promotion in terms of days or depth. 
So that really is, Paul, the big picture on the margin architecture for Bath & Body, and that's how we think about it, and that's certainly what we would hope investors would appreciate and understand. 
And then separately, on the management of expenses, the team, Nick, Andrew Meslow, the management team at Bath & Body is, frankly, extraordinary at balancing expense management in the business. So investing in things where it makes sense and being tough-minded and disciplined where it doesn't. So not just cutting hours and having bad customer experience is that -- the business offers terrific experiences for consumers. The business invest in product quality, et cetera. So the expense management in the business, the inventory discipline in the business is very, very strong, and those capabilities, that mindset, that stability in that management team is really what drives the overall result. 
With respect to the impairment and what geographies were included in the impairment, China was the greatest amount of impairment. But there was also, Paul, impairment, we impaired stores, and there was a charge associated with the U.K. and Ireland. And a little -- and some in the United States as well. But China was the biggest component, followed by the U.K. and Ireland, and then a little bit more in the United States beyond the impairments we took a year ago. 
Oh, and to answer your question, does it save depreciation? Yes, it does. And that's not -- some people think that's why you take impairments. That's it's actually a required accounting evaluation, so it's not to save depreciation, but in fact, it does have the result of reducing depreciation in forward periods. Obviously, Paul, part of the China evaluation relates to our business in Hong Kong, so unique circumstances there, as you would appreciate."

We leveraged the Campus Rep, campus representative program, which is significant. And frankly, and I don't mean to give you a vague or general answer to a question, it's the fundamental answer to the question.

Bath & Body Works exceeded our expectations for the quarter and continues to deliver strong results, with a 9% comp increase and a 10% increase in operating income. 
Outperformance at Bath & Body Works was offset by Victoria's Secret result that was at the low end of our expectations. Looking to the fourth quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share of about $2. New CEOs, John Mehas and Amy Hauk are very focused on getting close to our customers and making improvements to our merchandise assortments, marketing and customer experiences in stores and online. We have more work to do, and we recognize that it will take some time to see improvement in the business. 
Also, as mentioned earlier, we are up against aggressive promotions from last year and the time period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is 6 days shorter than last year. Therefore, our fourth quarter guidance assumes a Victoria's Secret merchandise margin dollar decline in the high single-digit range, which is consistent with our third quarter result. We expect continued strong performance from Bath & Body Works.

Again, a rebalancing of the mix there to really distort to sharp price points and highly accessible from a retail price positioning for intimates in PINK, and the consumer has reacted well to that. And it's driving a strong overall result. 
With respect to improvements that the team is making in apparel and, particularly in the tops business, obviously, there are adjustments happening on an ongoing basis. There is some strength in the apparel assortment, as was called out in our pre-circulated remarks. The business will continue to advance the assortment in the fourth quarter. But as you recognize in your question, more to come in 2020, in terms of change in the assortment -- the apparel assortment to drive the results we're looking for there. Thanks."

So there are some cross-currents on the merchandise margin line with AUR being planned up with lingerie, but down at PINK, given the different strategies there. To the extent that you hit your plans for each division. How should we think about kind of the net impact on merchandise margin in the near term? 
And then kind of separately, you cautioned that VS lingerie is up against a heavier promotional period from last year. Just overall, how are you thinking about the balance of capturing your fair share of traffic during the competitive holiday period versus holding firm on the product and AUR elevation strategy?"

So in terms of the AUR positioning for lingerie and for PINK, it starts with a point of view that John and Amy communicated back at the Analyst Day in September, which is the businesses are going after different target customers. That are in different stages of their life and otherwise just have some distinction. And so as a result of that, as you know, John is pursuing developing, pursuing offering more elevated products, more glamor, more fashion, a lot of emotional content. And over time, we expect that we'll get paid for that work through AUR and margin rates. Amy has, and team, have also done customer work, consumer work. And one of the things that they have assessed is that they really want to make sure that our offerings to that customer, again, a younger customer, that the offerings are highly accessible from a pricing standpoint. So there's a natural delineation in average unit retails. 
As it relates to margin rate with the context I just provided and over time or as a target, we would expect that both of the businesses, including in the bra business should earn healthy margin rates, consistent with those strategies. And so again, over time, I don't start with a point of view that the margin rates would necessarily be different between the 2. Again, the price levels are different. But I'm not sure that the margin rates would be different. 
Second part of your question was about promotion and how will we manage through the holiday period, given the significant promotions from a year ago. Obviously, we're trying to get paid for our work to have an appropriate amount of promotion, but there are a couple of things that I would just reinforce. One is we need to -- and we will, hand inventories a clean position, so that we start 2020 in a healthy inventory standpoint, both financially and numerically, and also in terms of the freshness and the quality of the assortment that we carry over into the spring season. So ensuring that, that happens, depending upon how things go, obviously, will be an important input to the degree or level of promotion through the holiday period. 
The other is, as you recognize in your question, it's a key time for our consumers. We have a lot of traffic in our stores and online. And we'll be balancing promotional levels to drive volume, engagement with customers, profit -- again the management of inventory flow and sell downs. So we're not overly principled about it. We certainly are pursuing a strategy it paid for our work and to reduce the level of promotion, but it is dynamic. We do a lot of testing, as you're familiar with. And we'll try to strike the right balance considering the factors that I've mentioned. Thanks."

So in terms of promotional approach, Oliver, segmentation, customer file. We engage with our customers in lots of ways -- lots of ways through e-mail, through direct traditional mail communication, through social media, et cetera. We certainly employ different views of segmentation in each of those and other contact strategies. So we have done that historically, we obviously work to get better at that over time. 
In terms of our general views about promotion and promotion in key periods, I would say, apart from not anniversarying some very significant intimate apparel promotions or at least going in, not expecting to anniversary some of those. Otherwise, I would say, our promotional strategy is largely consistent with the prior year with some evolution to fewer, simpler, more impactful offers. So that would be, I guess, the main point that I would want to register on promotion. And obviously, we utilize various segmentation approaches in our contact strategies. 
With respect to the store base part of our business. It's a critical part of our business, obviously, as we've registered very consistently now for many years, and I think was remarked on in our pre-circulated commentary, we open a lot of stores every year and we close stores every year. And on a net basis, we have opened more stores than we've closed. And that is just the natural, proactive, healthy management of a multi-unit store base. 
We believe strongly in relevance and the opportunities associated with the store-based business. And at the same time, as you also know, this isn't either/or, we have a very significant online business at both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. So we're pursuing appropriate growth and customer experiences in both channels. We actively manage our real estate. The real estate outcomes are a function of overall business performance. So obviously, we've pulled back on investment in the Victoria's business over the last 2 or 3 years, given its overall performance. And conversely, we've increased our investment in Bath & Body over the last 5 or 6 years, given the quality of overall result and the specific results that we get from remodeling stores or opening new stores that include the White Barn shop-in-shop treatment or overt White Barn store design, as we refer to it. So it's dynamic, but overall, we're a strong believer in the store-based part of our business. We're making important investments in it, where there's a result, and we proactively manage it.

I'm not sure we'll be evaluating as we close the year, start the next year as to whether we get after some of the -- in this next 12 months or whether it moves into 2021."

It seems like merchandise margin also got better relative to the second quarter. And the last piece is the tops business, it seems like that needs to turn. So I'm wondering if you can talk about Amy's strategies in tops. And with regard to the core lingerie business, it seems at least like the initial reception to the new strategic direction that John has laid out has not been received well. So I'm wondering if he is course-correcting, understanding that he hasn't affected the full assortment at this point. Just the sort of initial flows that came in, in the third quarter. It just -- it doesn't seem like the reception that has been favorable. So I'm wondering what sort of course- correcting measures he might be taking?"
285544,599266374,1872896,"L Brands, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2019",2019-11-21,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So on PINK, Kimberly, we recognized in the question, the progress made in the intimate apparel side of the business, bras and panties and the overall sequential trend improvement, still not where we want it to be. Margin dollars in the third quarter",673,"Yes. So on PINK, Kimberly, we recognized in the question, the progress made in the intimate apparel side of the business, bras and panties and the overall sequential trend improvement, still not where we want it to be. Margin dollars in the third quarter for PINK overall were down, but up in bras and panties, and down in the apparel categories, driven by tops, as mentioned. 
In terms of what is Amy doing about that. She and her team are leveraging our testing and speed and agility capabilities to provide more new offerings to the consumer in that space. And also doing more work in sport and seamless and outfitting with respect to sport and seamless in that part of the apparel part of the business. So it's not just how do we go back and try to do what we've done historically better, but rather really mining for, including a real emphasis on sport and seamless, what is the new positioning for apparel and, particularly apparel tops in PINK, again, leveraging our design and fast supply chain capabilities that the business has. 
So a work in process, some signs of success, but the overall result, not what we want it to be in apparel, and it's a big part of the business, as you appreciate. So the team is very focused on it. But it's right to be curious about it, the team very, very focused on continued improvement in that part of the business. 
With respect to an assessment of Victoria's Secret Lingerie and the initial offerings of that John has introduced into the assortment, I really believe it's substantially too early to come to any conclusion on it, and I'll elaborate on that. There certainly are offerings that have been introduced into the assortment that have had strong positive customer response, meaning new stuff, customer bought a lot of it, indication that glamor and elevation and product at higher price points, when executed well, get a strong customer response. Examples of that, more specifically, would include the match-back panty categories that come at substantially higher AURs, and that have a real fashion content to them along with sexy sleep and lounge offerings that have gotten a strong customer response. 
All that said, Kimberly, the progress, since why you're asking your question, the progress made those examples being provided has not been sufficient to overcome the year-on-year declines in other very significant categories within the intimate apparel and sleep and loungewear businesses. So we're very clear minded about where we are on an overall basis, with a lot more work to do. John is working smart and very hard building a new team, focused on improving execution in stores and online, along with some evolution on the marketing of the business. 
And there are signs of progress, for sure. But as again, commented on in our pre-released information, lapping a lot of promotion. And some weakness in legacy core frames that are big books of business. And what's happening there, as you would expect us to be doing is a lot of development work where we think we will have significant relaunch activity in 2020 in some of those early 2020 in some of those core frames that are big books of business that have meaningful year-on-year declines that we're not able to overcome with the progress we're seeing in some of the new items introduced. So that would be my overview of it. This is a business that's had challenges, lingerie, now for 3 or 4 years. And it's going to take some time to stabilize it and get it back to where it should be. I absolutely believe John and his team are working on the right stuff, signs of progress, but it's going to take some time. And all that said, shouldn't be interpreted as any sense of complacency or we'll get to it when we get to it, the team couldn't be working harder and with more energy to get the results that we're all looking for."

So on the La Senza charge, it's a noncash charge related to potential, and I emphasize potential liability that we may have with respect to leases and some credit support that we provided in connection with the transition of sourcing to a third party. So it's a booking of a noncash reserve for potential cash exposure that we may have in future periods. Related to, again, leases and credit support associated with sourcing. So that's what that is about. 
With respect to, Carla, our leverage and credit ratings, as we announced a year ago. The company is taking steps to reduce its leverage. We made a bit of progress in terms of debt reduction this year. And those steps include reductions of capital expenditures. We made a change in the dividend announced a year ago, taking effect in January that freed up a bit more than $300 million. So management with the board will continue to evaluate those things. The most important aspect of any of that is improving the cash flow of the business, which is associated with, as you appreciate, the operating improvements that we're pursuing in lingerie and PINK particularly. But at the end of the day, we have -- we expect to end the year with about $1.4 billion of cash. We generate significant free cash flow. Our debt maturity profile is healthy and well spaced out. And so those are all aspects of our capital structure that certainly we consider and any outside party would naturally consider."

And I expect that we'll have evolution of those things. Certainly, as we move through the next 6, 12 months. And John focused on those things. 
In terms of -- in a granular way, specifically as timing over the years shifted in terms of the airing of the fashion show, did we see specific material impact on short-term sales response to the airing of the fashion show, as a general matter, the answer to that question is no. So if you're like, oh my God, Stuart, you freaked out about the day after the fashion show result and what's going to happen based on -- it did air at different times over the years, and we didn't see a material impact on the next few days results. 
With that said, it was a very important part of the brand building of this business and was an important aspect of the brand and a remarkable marketing achievement.

The first thing I would say, Paul, and again, it may seem my pabulum, but I think it's important because it's really important, is an operating income rate for Bath & Body Works. In the low 20s. We believe, Nick, believes, that the business believes",537,"Yes. The first thing I would say, Paul, and again, it may seem my pabulum, but I think it's important because it's really important, is an operating income rate for Bath & Body Works. In the low 20s. We believe, Nick, believes, that the business believes is appropriate. And the business has consistently delivered very healthy top line growth and very healthy bottom line growth with a little bit of deleverage in the rate over the last few years, largely reflecting the impact on depreciation and occupancy of the White Barn remodel program that we believe is a very positive thing for the business. So that's the overarching point. 
With respect to movement in the merchandise margin rate, 3 or 4 things to know. There is some inflation in the supply chain. There is some impact of tariffs. There is some impact of channel shift given the outpacing growth is very dramatic and healthy, frankly, remarkable growth. In the direct side of that business, where the merchandise margin rate profile is a little different than the store profile. Again, that channel very profitable at the bottom line, but the geography of rate different. So that puts a little pressure on things. And promotion is up slightly and largely due to consumers responding in a very significant way when the business does offer promotion versus the business offering a lot more promotion in terms of days or depth. 
So that really is, Paul, the big picture on the margin architecture for Bath & Body, and that's how we think about it, and that's certainly what we would hope investors would appreciate and understand. 
And then separately, on the management of expenses, the team, Nick, Andrew Meslow, the management team at Bath & Body is, frankly, extraordinary at balancing expense management in the business. So investing in things where it makes sense and being tough-minded and disciplined where it doesn't. So not just cutting hours and having bad customer experience is that -- the business offers terrific experiences for consumers. The business invest in product quality, et cetera. So the expense management in the business, the inventory discipline in the business is very, very strong, and those capabilities, that mindset, that stability in that management team is really what drives the overall result. 
With respect to the impairment and what geographies were included in the impairment, China was the greatest amount of impairment. But there was also, Paul, impairment, we impaired stores, and there was a charge associated with the U.K. and Ireland. And a little -- and some in the United States as well. But China was the biggest component, followed by the U.K. and Ireland, and then a little bit more in the United States beyond the impairments we took a year ago. 
Oh, and to answer your question, does it save depreciation? Yes, it does. And that's not -- some people think that's why you take impairments. That's it's actually a required accounting evaluation, so it's not to save depreciation, but in fact, it does have the result of reducing depreciation in forward periods. Obviously, Paul, part of the China evaluation relates to our business in Hong Kong, so unique circumstances there, as you would appreciate."

We leveraged the Campus Rep, campus representative program, which is significant. And frankly, and I don't mean to give you a vague or general answer to a question, it's the fundamental answer to the question.

A pricing pyramid,  an assortment architecture that includes a range of price points in the assortment in major categories, good, better, and best and the business will continue to balance its offerings, it's  result, it's communication using that foundational aspect of any good retailer, and I don't mean to suggest in saying it that way that we always get it exactly right. Obviously, there are times where we execute against that better than others. 
But it really comes back to strong engagement with the consumer, good thinking from a merchandising standpoint around good, better and best, and then leveraging a speed mindset and a supply chain capability in terms of sourcing relationships and transportation and flow that allows us to make adjustments pretty quickly along those lines.

Bath & Body Works exceeded our expectations for the quarter and continues to deliver strong results, with a 9% comp increase and a 10% increase in operating income. 
Outperformance at Bath & Body Works was offset by Victoria's Secret result that was at the low end of our expectations. Looking to the fourth quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share of about $2. New CEOs, John Mehas and Amy Hauk are very focused on getting close to our customers and making improvements to our merchandise assortments, marketing and customer experiences in stores and online. We have more work to do, and we recognize that it will take some time to see improvement in the business. 
Also, as mentioned earlier, we are up against aggressive promotions from last year and the time period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is 6 days shorter than last year. Therefore, our fourth quarter guidance assumes a Victoria's Secret merchandise margin dollar decline in the high single-digit range, which is consistent with our third quarter result. We expect continued strong performance from Bath & Body Works. 
We're very focused on executing a successful holiday. We will continue to rely on the strength of our agility, and we will continue to test pricing and promotion strategies, react to customer preferences. And Chase into proven product winners to drive results. Thanks, and over to you, Amie."

Again, a rebalancing of the mix there to really distort to sharp price points and highly accessible from a retail price positioning for intimates in PINK, and the consumer has reacted well to that. And it's driving a strong overall result. 
With respect to improvements that the team is making in apparel and, particularly in the tops business, obviously, there are adjustments happening on an ongoing basis. There is some strength in the apparel assortment, as was called out in our pre-circulated remarks. The business will continue to advance the assortment in the fourth quarter. But as you recognize in your question, more to come in 2020, in terms of change in the assortment -- the apparel assortment to drive the results we're looking for there. Thanks."

So there are some cross-currents on the merchandise margin line with AUR being planned up with lingerie, but down at PINK, given the different strategies there. To the extent that you hit your plans for each division. How should we think about kind of the net impact on merchandise margin in the near term? 
And then kind of separately, you cautioned that VS lingerie is up against a heavier promotional period from last year. Just overall, how are you thinking about the balance of capturing your fair share of traffic during the competitive holiday period versus holding firm on the product and AUR elevation strategy?"

So in terms of the AUR positioning for lingerie and for PINK, it starts with a point of view that John and Amy communicated back at the Analyst Day in September, which is the businesses are going after different target customers. That are in different stages of their life and otherwise just have some distinction. And so as a result of that, as you know, John is pursuing developing, pursuing offering more elevated products, more glamor, more fashion, a lot of emotional content. And over time, we expect that we'll get paid for that work through AUR and margin rates. Amy has, and team, have also done customer work, consumer work. And one of the things that they have assessed is that they really want to make sure that our offerings to that customer, again, a younger customer, that the offerings are highly accessible from a pricing standpoint. So there's a natural delineation in average unit retails. 
As it relates to margin rate with the context I just provided and over time or as a target, we would expect that both of the businesses, including in the bra business should earn healthy margin rates, consistent with those strategies. And so again, over time, I don't start with a point of view that the margin rates would necessarily be different between the 2. Again, the price levels are different. But I'm not sure that the margin rates would be different. 
Second part of your question was about promotion and how will we manage through the holiday period, given the significant promotions from a year ago. Obviously, we're trying to get paid for our work to have an appropriate amount of promotion, but there are a couple of things that I would just reinforce. One is we need to -- and we will, hand inventories a clean position, so that we start 2020 in a healthy inventory standpoint, both financially and numerically, and also in terms of the freshness and the quality of the assortment that we carry over into the spring season. So ensuring that, that happens, depending upon how things go, obviously, will be an important input to the degree or level of promotion through the holiday period. 
The other is, as you recognize in your question, it's a key time for our consumers. We have a lot of traffic in our stores and online. And we'll be balancing promotional levels to drive volume, engagement with customers, profit -- again the management of inventory flow and sell downs. So we're not overly principled about it. We certainly are pursuing a strategy it paid for our work and to reduce the level of promotion, but it is dynamic. We do a lot of testing, as you're familiar with. And we'll try to strike the right balance considering the factors that I've mentioned. Thanks."

With respect to pricing in panties and apparel for lingerie, John is also in those categories, given the quality of the brand and what we believe is our opportunity in offering differentiated merchandise that has significantly more emotional content. He's shifting the panty business to include a lot more single ticket panties that are matched back panties that come at higher average unit retails.

So in terms of promotional approach, Oliver, segmentation, customer file. We engage with our customers in lots of ways -- lots of ways through e-mail, through direct traditional mail communication, through social media, et cetera. We certainly employ different views of segmentation in each of those and other contact strategies. So we have done that historically, we obviously work to get better at that over time. 
In terms of our general views about promotion and promotion in key periods, I would say, apart from not anniversarying some very significant intimate apparel promotions or at least going in, not expecting to anniversary some of those. Otherwise, I would say, our promotional strategy is largely consistent with the prior year with some evolution to fewer, simpler, more impactful offers. So that would be, I guess, the main point that I would want to register on promotion. And obviously, we utilize various segmentation approaches in our contact strategies. 
With respect to the store base part of our business. It's a critical part of our business, obviously, as we've registered very consistently now for many years, and I think was remarked on in our pre-circulated commentary, we open a lot of stores every year and we close stores every year. And on a net basis, we have opened more stores than we've closed. And that is just the natural, proactive, healthy management of a multi-unit store base. 
We believe strongly in relevance and the opportunities associated with the store-based business. And at the same time, as you also know, this isn't either/or, we have a very significant online business at both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. So we're pursuing appropriate growth and customer experiences in both channels. We actively manage our real estate. The real estate outcomes are a function of overall business performance. So obviously, we've pulled back on investment in the Victoria's business over the last 2 or 3 years, given its overall performance. And conversely, we've increased our investment in Bath & Body over the last 5 or 6 years, given the quality of overall result and the specific results that we get from remodeling stores or opening new stores that include the White Barn shop-in-shop treatment or overt White Barn store design, as we refer to it. So it's dynamic, but overall, we're a strong believer in the store-based part of our business. We're making important investments in it, where there's a result, and we proactively manage it.

And also doing more work in sport and seamless and outfitting with respect to sport and seamless in that part of the apparel part of the business.

So a work in process, some signs of success, but the overall result, not what we want it to be in apparel, and it's a big part of the business, as you appreciate. So the team is very focused on it. But it's right to be curious about it, the team very, very focused on continued improvement in that part of the business. 
With respect to an assessment of Victoria's Secret Lingerie and the initial offerings of that John has introduced into the assortment, I really believe it's substantially too early to come to any conclusion on it, and I'll elaborate on that. There certainly are offerings that have been introduced into the assortment that have had strong positive customer response, meaning new stuff, customer bought a lot of it, indication that glamor and elevation and product at higher price points, when executed well, get a strong customer response. Examples of that, more specifically, would include the match-back panty categories that come at substantially higher AURs, and that have a real fashion content to them along with sexy sleep and lounge offerings that have gotten a strong customer response. 
All that said, Kimberly, the progress, since why you're asking your question, the progress made those examples being provided has not been sufficient to overcome the year-on-year declines in other very significant categories within the intimate apparel and sleep and loungewear businesses. So we're very clear minded about where we are on an overall basis, with a lot more work to do. John is working smart and very hard building a new team, focused on improving execution in stores and online, along with some evolution on the marketing of the business. 
And there are signs of progress, for sure. But as again, commented on in our pre-released information, lapping a lot of promotion. And some weakness in legacy core frames that are big books of business. And what's happening there, as you would expect us to be doing is a lot of development work where we think we will have significant relaunch activity in 2020 in some of those early 2020 in some of those core frames that are big books of business that have meaningful year-on-year declines that we're not able to overcome with the progress we're seeing in some of the new items introduced. So that would be my overview of it. This is a business that's had challenges, lingerie, now for 3 or 4 years. And it's going to take some time to stabilize it and get it back to where it should be. I absolutely believe John and his team are working on the right stuff, signs of progress, but it's going to take some time. And all that said, shouldn't be interpreted as any sense of complacency or we'll get to it when we get to it, the team couldn't be working harder and with more energy to get the results that we're all looking for."

Thanks, Carla. So on the La Senza charge, it's a noncash charge related to potential, and I emphasize potential liability that we may have with respect to leases and some credit support that we provided in connection with the transition of sourcing to a third party. So it's a booking of a noncash reserve for potential cash exposure that we may have in future periods. Related to, again, leases and credit support associated with sourcing. So that's what that is about. 
With respect to, Carla, our leverage and credit ratings, as we announced a year ago. The company is taking steps to reduce its leverage. We made a bit of progress in terms of debt reduction this year. And those steps include reductions of capital expenditures. We made a change in the dividend announced a year ago, taking effect in January that freed up a bit more than $300 million. So management with the board will continue to evaluate those things. The most important aspect of any of that is improving the cash flow of the business, which is associated with, as you appreciate, the operating improvements that we're pursuing in lingerie and PINK particularly. But at the end of the day, we have -- we expect to end the year with about $1.4 billion of cash. We generate significant free cash flow. Our debt maturity profile is healthy and well spaced out. And so those are all aspects of our capital structure that certainly we consider and any outside party would naturally consider."

Again, we believe the most important thing is the quality of the merchandise itself, the quality of our execution in selling in stores and online, but, Marni, we recognize and appreciate that the communication of the brand, the offerings, the emotional content of Victoria's Secret is obviously an important thing. And I expect that we'll have evolution of those things. Certainly, as we move through the next 6, 12 months. And John focused on those things. 
In terms of -- in a granular way, specifically as timing over the years shifted in terms of the airing of the fashion show, did we see specific material impact on short-term sales response to the airing of the fashion show, as a general matter, the answer to that question is no. So if you're like, oh my God, Stuart, you freaked out about the day after the fashion show result and what's going to happen based on -- it did air at different times over the years, and we didn't see a material impact on the next few days results. 
With that said, it was a very important part of the brand building of this business and was an important aspect of the brand and a remarkable marketing achievement. And with that said, we're figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers, and that's among the things that John is focused on."

The first thing I would say, Paul, and again, it may seem my pabulum, but I think it's important because it's really important, is an operating income rate for Bath & Body Works. In the low 20s. We believe, Nick, believes, that the business believes",537,"Yes. The first thing I would say, Paul, and again, it may seem my pabulum, but I think it's important because it's really important, is an operating income rate for Bath & Body Works. In the low 20s. We believe, Nick, believes, that the business believes is appropriate. And the business has consistently delivered very healthy top line growth and very healthy bottom line growth with a little bit of deleverage in the rate over the last few years, largely reflecting the impact on depreciation and occupancy of the White Barn remodel program that we believe is a very positive thing for the business. So that's the overarching point. 
With respect to movement in the merchandise margin rate, 3 or 4 things to know. There is some inflation in the supply chain. There is some impact of tariffs. There is some impact of channel shift given the outpacing growth is very dramatic and healthy, frankly, remarkable growth. In the direct side of that business, where the merchandise margin rate profile is a little different than the store profile. Again, that channel very profitable at the bottom line, but the geography of rate different. So that puts a little pressure on things. And promotion is up slightly and largely due to consumers responding in a very significant way when the business does offer promotion versus the business offering a lot more promotion in terms of days or depth. 
So that really is, Paul, the big picture on the margin architecture for Bath & Body, and that's how we think about it, and that's certainly what we would hope investors would appreciate and understand. 
And then separately, on the management of expenses, the team, Nick, Andrew Meslow, the management team at Bath & Body is, frankly, extraordinary at balancing expense management in the business. So investing in things where it makes sense and being tough-minded and disciplined where it doesn't. So not just cutting hours and having bad customer experience is that -- the business offers terrific experiences for consumers. The business invest in product quality, et cetera. So the expense management in the business, the inventory discipline in the business is very, very strong, and those capabilities, that mindset, that stability in that management team is really what drives the overall result. 
With respect to the impairment and what geographies were included in the impairment, China was the greatest amount of impairment. But there was also, Paul, impairment, we impaired stores, and there was a charge associated with the U.K. and Ireland. And a little -- and some in the United States as well. But China was the biggest component, followed by the U.K. and Ireland, and then a little bit more in the United States beyond the impairments we took a year ago. 
Oh, and to answer your question, does it save depreciation? Yes, it does. And that's not -- some people think that's why you take impairments. That's it's actually a required accounting evaluation, so it's not to save depreciation, but in fact, it does have the result of reducing depreciation in forward periods. Obviously, Paul, part of the China evaluation relates to our business in Hong Kong, so unique circumstances there, as you would appreciate."

We leveraged the Campus Rep, campus representative program, which is significant. And frankly, and I don't mean to give you a vague or general answer to a question, it's the fundamental answer to the question. Like any good retailer would do, we think about it as good, better, and best. A pricing pyramid, an assortment architecture that includes a range of price points in the assortment in major categories, good, better, and best and the business will continue to balance its offerings, it's result, it's communication using that foundational aspect of any good retailer, and I don't mean to suggest in saying it that way that we always get it exactly right. Obviously, there are times where we execute against that better than others. 
But it really comes back to strong engagement with the consumer, good thinking from a merchandising standpoint around good, better and best, and then leveraging a speed mindset and a supply chain capability in terms of sourcing relationships and transportation and flow that allows us to make adjustments pretty quickly along those lines. So that's how we think about them."
