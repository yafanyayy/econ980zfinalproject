Our business ended the year with broad strength across geographies and business lines. The fourth quarter was highlighted by 16% fee revenue growth in our regional services businesses, with positive operating leverage in those businesses driven by leasing and Occupier Outsourcing. This led to adjusted EPS growth of 26% for the quarter. 
For the year, adjusted EPS rose 20% on 15% growth in fee revenue. This marks our ninth consecutive year of double-digit increases in adjusted EPS. Our results for both the quarter and the year reflect the operational gains in capital investments we have made to enable our people to produce hard-to-replicate client outcomes. 
Our leasing business is a good example. We repositioned this business 4 years ago in response to client appetite for greater advisory services, and now have more than 1,000 dedicated specialists working alongside our transaction professionals. They advise clients on workplace design and employee experience, labor and location analytics, government incentives and supply chain optimization, among other things. No competitor has the capacity to invest in advisory capabilities to the same degree that CBRE has. This is creating competitive differentiation and contributing to strong leasing revenue growth, particularly with account-based clients.
While we were having one of our best quarters on record, we also worked diligently to prepare for the reorganization that took effect on January 1. This structure puts several of our sectors' very best leaders in compelling new leadership roles, sharpens our focus on excellence across our services and enables operating efficiencies across our business.
These moves are already having an impact, and we expect them to come through in our financial performance in 2019.
Before I hand the call over to Jim, I'll comment on the plan we announced in January to split his responsibilities. Our scale and financial strength, much of which resulted from Jim's excellent work, gives CBRE unique advantages as an inventor in our sector. Jim is a savvy investor with a proven long-term record of successfully allocating and deploying capital. We will benefit greatly from his exclusive focus in this critically important area. I want to thank Jim for his many contributions as our CFO. Our search for a new CFO is progressing nicely.
Now Jim will discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and the year in more detail."

Before discussing our performance, I want to say how much I am looking forward to devoting my full attention to allocating and investing our capital. We have built up considerable investment capacity and anticipate great opportunities to deploy capital over time to add value for our shareholders and capabilities for our clients. I also look forward to working closely with our new CFO. 
As Bob noted, CBRE had an outstanding quarter and year. Fee revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS each reached all-time highs, with double-digit growth across all metrics.
For the quarter, consolidated fee revenue rose 18% in local currency. Growth in the quarter was predominantly organic. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% and adjusted EPS increased 26%, both in US dollars. For the year, adjusted EBITDA exceeded $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.28 increased 20% over prior year. Our full year adjusted net income margin of 10.4% on fee revenue is up 50 basis points over 2017 and is a new record high for CBRE.
Our balance sheet is very well positioned for the future. At year-end, net debt was only 0.6x 2018 adjusted EBITDA. Late in the quarter, we borrowed EUR 400 million on a new term loan and used the proceeds to repay U.S. dollar term loans. We expect this transaction to reduce our annual interest expense by about $12 million, while also reducing the FX translation risk from our European business.  In addition, we launched a refresh of our existing $2.8 billion line of credit for a new 5-year term that we expect to close in March.
We also took advantage of volatility in the equity markets to buyback over $200 million of our stock. Through early January, we opportunistically acquired 5.1 million shares at an average price of $40.20 per share.
Finally, I want to remind everyone that as we discussed last quarter, we are introducing our new segment disclosures at our Investor Day in 3 weeks. We'll be providing guidance based on those new segments at that time. Please hold your questions about our 2019 forecast until our Investor Day.
Please turn to Slide 6, which details the revenue performance of our major lines of business for Q4. Leasing was incredibly strong this quarter globally, with a 24% increase over last year. All 3 regions produced double-digit increases. As Bob noted earlier, account-based work is representing a growing portion of our leasing business, and this was certainly the case in the fourth quarter. Americas led, with leasing up 27%, mostly driven by 29% growth in the U.S. on top of 16% growth in Q4 of the prior year. M&A contributed about 4%. 
The accelerating growth of flexible office solutions was also a tailwind, and we estimate that working with flexible space operators and placing our customers in their space accounted for 3% of our U.S. growth. The remainder is explained by market share gains and the strong overall leasing market.
Our U.S. leasing business saw increases in the number of transactions, average square footage and price per square foot. Given the continued economic strength, companies are adding incremental office space and trading up to newer, more modern space.
Global property sales revenue increased 10%, led by the Americas with a 13% increase. 10% growth in Asia Pacific was notably led by China. While there's uncertainty around trade in China, we have seen high levels of investment activity from both foreign and domestic capital. Investments in our team and platform and China are also driving growth in the business.
Our commercial mortgage origination business showed continued strength with 16% revenue growth. In 2018, CBRE originated the most agency multifamily mortgages in the U.S. for the fifth time in 6 years. We were also the #1 Freddie Mac originator for the tenth year in a row. Strong originations in the quarter helped our loan servicing portfolio cross the $200 billion mark. And recurring servicing revenues rose 20% for the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 7, which highlights our Occupier Outsourcing business, which as Bob mentioned, had another quarter of impressive growth. Fee revenue rose 20% for the quarter and 19% for the year. This was driven by strong organic growth of 16% for the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth has been driven by an ability to create value for our clients with an unmatched platform. The depth and breadth of our platform has been materially enhanced in recent years with the successful integrations of Noland, JCI's Global Workplace Solutions business and FacilitySource, along with numerous smaller specialty firms.
As an example, in the fourth quarter, we combined the capabilities of FacilitySource, which we acquired in June, with the strength of our existing outsourcing platform to win one of our largest ever facility management contracts with a new outsourcing clients. These combined capabilities allowed CBRE to provide a tailored client solution that could not be matched by others.
An example of an expanding existing relationship is Uber. In the fourth quarter, Uber ordered us a global mandate to provide a full suite of outsourcing services, including strategic consulting and transactions, facilities and project management for its 6 million square foot portfolio.
Investments in digital and technology capabilities and our CBRE 360 workplace experience service, which we recently renamed Host, were important in differentiating our offering. We're growing capabilities in a record year-end pipeline. This businesses poised for another year of solid double-digit growth.
Please turn to Slide 8, which summarizes our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue was up 18%, driven by growth in asset management and incentive fees and higher carried interest. Adjusted EBITDA rose 7% in the quarter, despite a mark-to-market loss of $7 million on co-investments in public securities in a turbulent quarter. These co-investment losses have since reversed with improved public markets in January.
We continued to attract significant capital due to our record of generating a very good returns for our fund and separate account investors. Capital raising rose 10% during 2018 to $10.9 billion, a record for the company. Assets Under Management increased by $1 billion in US dollars from the prior quarter to $105.5 billion. For the year, AUM increased $2.3 billion in US dollars and $5.1 billion in local currency.
Please turn to Slide 9, which summarizes our Development Services segment. This business had a remarkable year with $185 million of adjusted EBITDA, up 55% over prior year. $34 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was on par with a strong Q4 2017. Our developments in process reached a record level of $9 billion, a strong indicator of anticipated activity over the next few years.
As a reminder, this business consumes relatively little capital. We had $100 million invested in development projects at year-end 2018, and just $8 million of repayment guarantees on outstanding debt balances.
Following 2018's record performance, we expect 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be closer to 2017, which was our next strongest year ever.
Now please turn to Slide 10 for Bob's closing remarks."

We start the new year with excellent momentum across our global business. Our people are energized and aligned behind our strategy. Our new organizational structure will allow them to take maximum advantage of CBRE's scale and resources and growing suite of technology tools.
Globally, the economy is expected to grow at a healthy but moderately slower pace than in 2018. Cross-border capital flows are solid, notwithstanding the ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions. While we remain mindful of potential macro challenges and the length of the current economic expansion, this continues to be a supportive environment for our business.
As always, transaction volumes are difficult to forecast, however, we expect solid revenue growth in our transaction businesses in 2019, supported by market share gains. We also see strong continued momentum in real estate outsourcing as interest accelerates in new sectors and customers expand existing mandates. 
In addition, our competitive advantages continued t strengthen, driven by large investments and strategic acquisitions and strong operational and technology gains. This portends another year of strong growth for our outsourcing business in 2019. 
Finally, we continue to make material investments in our business at a level similar to 2018, with the intention of further differentiating our products and services. In 2019, we expect solid top line growth while also achieving modest positive operating leverage in our advisory and outsourcing businesses.
We will discuss all of this and more in detail at our Investor Day, and we look forward to seeing everyone in New York on March 7. 
Before I close, let me thank everyone at CBRE for another outstanding year in 2018. We are very proud of their dedicated efforts on behalf of our clients and our shareholders. And now, operator, we'll open the line for questions."

Everything that you're seeing going on with e-commerce in the -- in both directions, the e-commerce sell and then the returns, which have become huge, is prompting a lot of leasing activity that we haven't seen historically in warehouse face various types, small and large. So all of that is helping the sector. And then as it relates to a company like ourselves and specifically to us, since it's us we're talking about I guess, the account-based business is growing, and we are in a super good position to take advantage of that with our global footprint, with our ability to invest in all these advisory services. We now have 1,000 people around the world working on advisory-related services for clients to kind of supplement our traditional tenant rep business. The technology platform we can build. The to link our outsourcing to our FM and Project Management clients. All of that account-based work is growing, and we're taking a disproportionate share of that and that's coming through in the numbers.

We've made the choice to go into the co-working or flexible space market with Hana. Obviously, in this last cycle, we escalated materially our participation in multifamily. We think that was a really good call. We have now sizable multifamily development business, and we've always had a sizable multifamily trading and financing business. But for the most part, we like the businesses we're in, and we see opportunities all over our business to expand. We don't have 10% market share globally in anything we do, and we're constantly scanning our lines of business and our geographies for places where we think we can do more. By the way, this reorganization should really help in that regard. So let's take our advisory business. If you went back to the organizational structure we had last year and before and look across the geographies, to a degree, among our leadership team, we had co-mingled our outsourcing business and our advisory business, our brokerage businesses. We're going to have much more folks now. We have mechanisms to ensure synergy between the 2. But we're going to have much more focus. And if you were to ask Michael Lafitte, the Global Head of our advisory business, what he's going to do. We have 12 divisional presidents around the world in that advisory business. And one of the things he's going to ask them to focus on in each major market is understanding whether or not we're the leader in lease -- occupier leasing, we're the leader in agency leasing, whether we're the leader in capital markets and financing and understand that the plate and to the extent we aren't go after. That's one of the reasons were so confident that this reorganization is going to be powerful.

We do a lot -- we lease -- we do a lot, obviously, leasing in the industrial space. We do leasing in the retail space. But there is an awful lot of what's going on the leasing world. We represent most big occupiers around the world. Most big occupiers around the world, the majority of their leasing will still be in spaces that are not co- working spaces. And so we don't think on the margin that what we're doing with Hana or what our clients out in the market space that are in the agile or co-working arena, will have a big impact on our leasing business.

Our business ended the year with broad strength across geographies and business lines. The fourth quarter was highlighted by 16% fee revenue growth in our regional services businesses, with positive operating leverage in those businesses driven by leasing and Occupier Outsourcing. This led to adjusted EPS growth of 26% for the quarter. 
For the year, adjusted EPS rose 20% on 15% growth in fee revenue. This marks our ninth consecutive year of double-digit increases in adjusted EPS. Our results for both the quarter and the year reflect the operational gains in capital investments we have made to enable our people to produce hard-to-replicate client outcomes. 
Our leasing business is a good example. We repositioned this business 4 years ago in response to client appetite for greater advisory services, and now have more than 1,000 dedicated specialists working alongside our transaction professionals. They advise clients on workplace design and employee experience, labor and location analytics, government incentives and supply chain optimization among other things. No competitor has the capacity to invest in advisory capabilities to the same degree that CBRE has. This is creating competitive differentiation and contributing to strong leasing revenue growth, particularly with account-based clients.
While we were having one of our best quarters on record, we also work diligently to prepare for the reorganization that took effect on January 1. The structure puts several of our sectors' very best leaders in compelling new leadership roles, sharpens our focus on excellence across our services and enables operating efficiencies across our business. These moves are already having an impact, and we expect them to come through in our financial performance in 2019.
Before I hand the call over to Jim, I'll comment on the plan we announced in January to split his responsibilities. Our scale and financial strength, much of which resulted from Jim's excellent work, gives CBRE unique advantages as an investor in our sector. Jim is a savvy investor with a proven long-term record of successfully allocating and deploying capital. We will benefit greatly from his exclusive focus in this critically important area. I want to thank Jim for his many contributions as our CFO. Our search for a new CFO is progressing nicely.
Now Jim will discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and the year in more detail."

Before discussing our performance, I want to say how much I am looking forward to devoting my full attention to allocating and investing our capital. We have built up considerable investment capacity and anticipate great opportunities to deploy capital over time to add value for our shareholders and capabilities for our clients. I also look forward to working closely with our new CFO. 
As Bob noted, CBRE had an outstanding quarter and year. Fee revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, each reached all-time highs with double-digit growth across all metrics.
For the quarter, consolidated fee revenue rose 18% in local currency. Growth in the quarter was predominantly organic. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% and adjusted EPS increased 26%, both in U.S. dollars. For the year, adjusted EBITDA exceeded $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.28, increased 20% over prior year. Our full year adjusted net income margin of 10.4% on fee revenue is up 50 basis points over 2017 and is a new record high for CBRE.
Our balance sheet is very well positioned for the future. At year-end, net debt was only 0.6x 2018 adjusted EBITDA. Late in the quarter, we borrowed EUR 400 million on a new term loan and used the proceeds to repay U.S. dollar term loans. We expect this transaction to reduce our annual interest expense by about $12 million, while also reducing the FX translation risk from our European business.  In addition, we launched a refresh of our existing USD 2.8 billion line of credit for a new 5-year term that we expect to close in March.
We also took advantage of volatility in the equity markets to buy back over $200 million of our stock. Through early January, we opportunistically acquired 5.1 million shares at an average price of $40.20 per share.
Finally, I want to remind everyone that as we discussed last quarter, we are introducing our new segment disclosures at our Investor Day in 3 weeks. We'll be providing guidance based on those new segments at that time. Please hold your questions about our 2019 forecast until our Investor Day.
Please turn to Slide 6, which details the revenue performance of our major lines of business for Q4. Leasing was incredibly strong this quarter globally, with a 24% increase over last year. All 3 regions produced double-digit increases. As Bob noted earlier, account-based work is representing a growing portion of our leasing business, and this was certainly the case in the fourth quarter. Americas led with leasing up 27%, mostly driven by 29% growth in the U.S. on top of 16% growth in Q4 of the prior year. M&A contributed about 4%. 
The accelerating growth of flexible office solutions was also a tailwind, and we estimate that working with flexible space operators and placing our customers in their space accounted for 3% of our U.S. growth. The remainder is explained by market share gains and the strong overall leasing market.
Our U.S. leasing business saw increases in the number of transactions, average square footage and price per square foot. Given the continued economic strength, companies are adding incremental office space and trading up to newer, more modern space.
Global property sales revenue increased 10%, led by the Americas with a 13% increase. 10% growth in Asia Pacific was notably led by China. While there is uncertainty around trade in China, we have seen high levels of investment activity from both foreign and domestic capital. Investments in our team and platform in China are also driving growth in the business.
Our commercial mortgage origination business showed continued strength with 16% revenue growth. In 2018, CBRE originated the most agency multifamily mortgages in the U.S. for the fifth time in 6 years. We were also the #1 Freddie Mac originator for the 10th year in a row. Strong originations in the quarter helped our loan servicing portfolio cross the $200 billion mark, and recurring servicing revenues rose 20% for the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 7, which highlights our Occupier Outsourcing business, which as Bob mentioned, had another quarter of impressive growth. Fee revenue rose 20% for the quarter and 19% for the year. This was driven by strong organic growth of 16% for the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth has been driven by an ability to create value for our clients with an unmatched platform. The depth and breadth of our platform has been materially enhanced in recent years with the successful integrations of Noland, JCI's Global Workplace Solutions business and FacilitySource, along with numerous smaller specialty firms.
As an example, in the fourth quarter, we combined the capabilities of FacilitySource, which we acquired in June, with the strength of our existing outsourcing platform to win one of our largest ever facility management contracts with a new outsourcing client. These combined capabilities allowed CBRE to provide a tailored client solution that could not be matched by others.
An example of an expanding existing relationship is Uber. In the fourth quarter, Uber ordered us a global mandate to provide a full suite of outsourcing services, including strategic consulting and transactions, facilities and project management for its 6 million square foot portfolio. Investments in digital and technology capabilities and our CBRE 360 workplace experience service, which we recently renamed Host, were important in differentiating our offering. We're growing capabilities in a record year-end pipeline. This business is poised for another year of solid double-digit growth.
Please turn to Slide 8, which summarizes our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue was up 18%, driven by growth in asset management and incentive fees and higher carried interest. Adjusted EBITDA rose 7% in the quarter, despite a mark-to-market loss of $7 million on co-investments in public securities in a turbulent quarter. These co-investment losses have since reversed with improved public markets in January.
We continue to attract significant capital due to our record of generating very good returns for our fund and separate account investors. Capital raising rose 10% during 2018 to $10.9 billion, a record for the company. Assets Under Management increased by $1 billion in U.S. dollars from the prior quarter to $105.5 billion. For the year, AUM increased $2.3 billion in U.S. dollars and $5.1 billion in local currency.
Please turn to Slide 9, which summarizes our Development Services segment. This business had a remarkable year with $185 million of adjusted EBITDA, up 55% over prior year. $34 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was on par with a strong Q4 2017. Our developments in process reached a record level of $9 billion, a strong indicator of anticipated activity over the next few years.
As a reminder, this business consumes relatively little capital. We had $100 million invested in development projects at year-end 2018 and just $8 million of repayment guarantees on outstanding debt balances.
Following 2018's record performance, we expect 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be closer to 2017, which was our next strongest year ever.
Now please turn to Slide 10 for Bob's closing remarks."

We start the new year with excellent momentum across our global business. Our people are energized and aligned behind our strategy. Our new organizational structure will allow them to take maximum advantage of CBRE's scale and resources and growing suite of technology tools.
Globally, the economy is expected to grow at a healthy but moderately slower pace than in 2018. Cross-border capital flows are solid, notwithstanding the ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions. While we remain mindful of potential macro challenges and the length of the current economic expansion, this continues to be a supportive environment for our business.
As always, transaction volumes are difficult to forecast, however, we expect solid revenue growth in our transaction businesses in 2019, supported by market share gains. We also see strong continued momentum in real estate outsourcing as interest accelerates in new sectors and customers expand existing mandates. 
In addition, our competitive advantages continued to strengthen, driven by large investments in strategic acquisitions and strong operational and technology gains. This portends another year of strong growth for our outsourcing business in 2019. 
Finally, we continue to make material investments in our business at a level similar to 2018, with the intention of further differentiating our products and services. In 2019, we expect solid top line growth while also achieving modest positive operating leverage in our advisory and outsourcing businesses. We will discuss all of this and more in detail at our Investor Day, and we look forward to seeing everyone in New York on March 7. 
Before I close, let me thank everyone at CBRE for another outstanding year in 2018. We are very proud of their dedicated efforts on behalf of our clients and our shareholders.

Everything that you're seeing going on with e-commerce in the -- in both directions, the e-commerce sell and then the returns, which have become huge, is prompting a lot of leasing activity that we haven't seen historically in warehouse space of various types, small and large. So all of that is helping the sector. And then as it relates to a company like ourselves and specifically to us, since it's us we're talking about I guess, the account-based business is growing, and we are in a super good position to take advantage of that with our global footprint, with our ability to invest in all these advisory services. We now have 1,000 people around the world working on advisory-related services for clients to, kind of, supplement our traditional tenant rep business. The technology platform we can build. The link to our outsourcing to our FM and Project Management clients. All of that account-based work is growing, and we're taking a disproportionate share of that and that's coming through in the numbers.

We've made the choice to go into the co-working or flexible space market with Hana. Obviously, in this last cycle, we escalated materially our participation in multifamily. We think that was a really good call. We have now sizable multifamily development business, and we've always had a sizable multifamily trading and financing business.

We don't have 10% market share globally in anything we do, and we're constantly scanning our lines of business and our geographies for places where we think we can do more. By the way, this reorganization should really help in that regard. So let's take our advisory business. If you went back to the organizational structure we had last year and before and look across the geographies, to a degree, among our leadership team, we had co-mingled our outsourcing business and our advisory business, our brokerage businesses. We're going to have much more focus now. We have mechanisms to ensure synergy between the two. But we're going to have much more focus. And if you were to ask Mike Lafitte, the Global Head of our advisory business, what he's going to do. We have 12 divisional presidents around the world in that advisory business. And one of the things he's going to ask them to focus on in each major market is understanding whether or not we're the leader in lease -- in occupier leasing, we're the leader in agency leasing, whether we're the leader in capital markets and financing and understand that deeply and to the extent we don't go after. That's one of the reasons we're so confident that this reorganization is going to be powerful.

When you look at our leasing activity and you look at the leasing activity of our good competitors, it's much bigger than just flexible workspace. We had a question a minute ago, why only 3% when the market absorption is 20%? Well, first of all, that's just office space, right? We do a lot -- we lease -- we do a lot of leasing, obviously, in the industrial space. We do leasing in the retail space. But there is an awful lot of what's going on in the leasing world. We represent most big occupiers around the world. Most big occupiers around the world, the majority of their leasing will still be in spaces that are not co-working spaces. And so we don't think on the margin that what we're doing with Hana or what our clients out in the market space that are in the agile or co-working arena, do -- will have a big impact on our leasing business. Certainly not for the foreseeable future. Now if co-working didn't go to 10%, then, in fact, went to 20% or 30%, then maybe we'd move more in the direction of Hana and see a little bit of back pressure on our leasing, but we're not seeing it now."

Our business ended the year with broad strength across geographies and business lines. The fourth quarter was highlighted by 16% fee revenue growth in our regional services businesses, with positive operating leverage in those businesses driven by leasing and Occupier Outsourcing. This led to adjusted EPS growth of 26% for the quarter. 
For the year, adjusted EPS rose 20% on 15% growth in fee revenue. This marks our ninth consecutive year of double-digit increases in adjusted EPS. Our results for both the quarter and the year reflect the operational gains in capital investments we have made to enable our people to produce hard-to-replicate client outcomes. 
Our leasing business is a good example. We repositioned this business 4 years ago in response to client appetite for greater advisory services, and now have more than 1,000 dedicated specialists working alongside our transaction professionals. They advise clients on workplace design and employee experience, labor and location analytics, government incentives and supply chain optimization among other things. No competitor has the capacity to invest in advisory capabilities to the same degree that CBRE has. This is creating competitive differentiation and contributing to strong leasing revenue growth, particularly with account-based clients.
While we were having one of our best quarters on record, we also work diligently to prepare for the reorganization that took effect on January 1. The structure puts several of our sectors' very best leaders in compelling new leadership roles, sharpens our focus on excellence across our services and enables operating efficiencies across our business. These moves are already having an impact, and we expect them to come through in our financial performance in 2019.
Before I hand the call over to Jim, I'll comment on the plan we announced in January to split his responsibilities. Our scale and financial strength, much of which resulted from Jim's excellent work, gives CBRE unique advantages as an investor in our sector. Jim is a savvy investor with a proven long-term record of successfully allocating and deploying capital. We will benefit greatly from his exclusive focus in this critically important area. I want to thank Jim for his many contributions as our CFO. Our search for a new CFO is progressing nicely.
Now Jim will discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and the year in more detail."

Before discussing our performance, I want to say how much I am looking forward to devoting my full attention to allocating and investing our capital. We have built up considerable investment capacity and anticipate great opportunities to deploy capital over time to add value for our shareholders and capabilities for our clients. I also look forward to working closely with our new CFO. 
As Bob noted, CBRE had an outstanding quarter and year. Fee revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, each reached all-time highs with double-digit growth across all metrics.
For the quarter, consolidated fee revenue rose 18% in local currency. Growth in the quarter was predominantly organic. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% and adjusted EPS increased 26%, both in U.S. dollars. For the year, adjusted EBITDA exceeded $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.28, increased 20% over prior year. Our full year adjusted net income margin of 10.4% on fee revenue is up 50 basis points over 2017 and is a new record high for CBRE.
Our balance sheet is very well positioned for the future. At year-end, net debt was only 0.6x 2018 adjusted EBITDA. Late in the quarter, we borrowed EUR 400 million on a new term loan and used the proceeds to repay U.S. dollar term loans. We expect this transaction to reduce our annual interest expense by about $12 million, while also reducing the FX translation risk from our European business.  In addition, we launched a refresh of our existing USD 2.8 billion line of credit for a new 5-year term that we expect to close in March.
We also took advantage of volatility in the equity markets to buy back over $200 million of our stock. Through early January, we opportunistically acquired 5.1 million shares at an average price of $40.20 per share.
Finally, I want to remind everyone that as we discussed last quarter, we are introducing our new segment disclosures at our Investor Day in 3 weeks. We'll be providing guidance based on those new segments at that time. Please hold your questions about our 2019 forecast until our Investor Day.
Please turn to Slide 6, which details the revenue performance of our major lines of business for Q4. Leasing was incredibly strong this quarter globally, with a 24% increase over last year. All 3 regions produced double-digit increases. As Bob noted earlier, account-based work is representing a growing portion of our leasing business, and this was certainly the case in the fourth quarter. Americas led with leasing up 27%, mostly driven by 29% growth in the U.S. on top of 16% growth in Q4 of the prior year. M&A contributed about 4%. 
The accelerating growth of flexible office solutions was also a tailwind, and we estimate that working with flexible space operators and placing our customers in their space accounted for 3% of our U.S. growth. The remainder is explained by market share gains and the strong overall leasing market.
Our U.S. leasing business saw increases in the number of transactions, average square footage and price per square foot. Given the continued economic strength, companies are adding incremental office space and trading up to newer, more modern space.
Global property sales revenue increased 10%, led by the Americas with a 13% increase. 10% growth in Asia Pacific was notably led by China. While there is uncertainty around trade in China, we have seen high levels of investment activity from both foreign and domestic capital. Investments in our team and platform in China are also driving growth in the business.
Our commercial mortgage origination business showed continued strength with 16% revenue growth. In 2018, CBRE originated the most agency multifamily mortgages in the U.S. for the fifth time in 6 years. We were also the #1 Freddie Mac originator for the 10th year in a row. Strong originations in the quarter helped our loan servicing portfolio cross the $200 billion mark, and recurring servicing revenues rose 20% for the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 7, which highlights our Occupier Outsourcing business, which as Bob mentioned, had another quarter of impressive growth. Fee revenue rose 20% for the quarter and 19% for the year. This was driven by strong organic growth of 16% for the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth has been driven by an ability to create value for our clients with an unmatched platform. The depth and breadth of our platform has been materially enhanced in recent years with the successful integrations of Noland, JCI's Global Workplace Solutions business and FacilitySource, along with numerous smaller specialty firms.
As an example, in the fourth quarter, we combined the capabilities of FacilitySource, which we acquired in June, with the strength of our existing outsourcing platform to win one of our largest ever facility management contracts with a new outsourcing client. These combined capabilities allowed CBRE to provide a tailored client solution that could not be matched by others.
An example of an expanding existing relationship is Uber. In the fourth quarter, Uber ordered us a global mandate to provide a full suite of outsourcing services, including strategic consulting and transactions, facilities and project management for its 6 million square foot portfolio. Investments in digital and technology capabilities and our CBRE 360 workplace experience service, which we recently renamed Host, were important in differentiating our offering. With growing capabilities in a record year-end pipeline, this business is poised for another year of solid double-digit growth.
Please turn to Slide 8, which summarizes our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue was up 18%, driven by growth in asset management and incentive fees and higher carried interest. Adjusted EBITDA rose 7% in the quarter, despite a mark-to-market loss of $7 million on co-investments in public securities in a turbulent quarter. These co-investment losses have since reversed with improved public markets in January.
We continue to attract significant capital due to our record of generating very good returns for our fund and separate account investors. Capital raising rose 10% during 2018 to $10.9 billion, a record for the company. Assets Under Management increased by $1 billion in U.S. dollars from the prior quarter to $105.5 billion. For the year, AUM increased $2.3 billion in U.S. dollars and $5.1 billion in local currency.
Please turn to Slide 9, which summarizes our Development Services segment. This business had a remarkable year with $185 million of adjusted EBITDA, up 55% over prior year. $34 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was on par with a strong Q4 2017. Our developments in process reached a record level of $9 billion, a strong indicator of anticipated activity over the next few years.
As a reminder, this business consumes relatively little capital. We had $100 million invested in development projects at year-end 2018 and just $8 million of repayment guarantees on outstanding debt balances.
Following 2018's record performance, we expect 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be closer to 2017, which was our next strongest year ever.
Now please turn to Slide 10 for Bob's closing remarks."

We start the new year with excellent momentum across our global business. Our people are energized and aligned behind our strategy. Our new organizational structure will allow them to take maximum advantage of CBRE's scale and resources and growing suite of technology tools.
Globally, the economy is expected to grow at a healthy but moderately slower pace than in 2018. Cross-border capital flows are solid, notwithstanding the ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions. While we remain mindful of potential macro challenges and the length of the current economic expansion, this continues to be a supportive environment for our business.
As always, transaction volumes are difficult to forecast, however, we expect solid revenue growth in our transaction businesses in 2019, supported by market share gains. We also see strong continued momentum in real estate outsourcing as interest accelerates in new sectors and customers expand existing mandates. 
In addition, our competitive advantages continued to strengthen, driven by large investments in strategic acquisitions and strong operational and technology gains. This portends another year of strong growth for our outsourcing business in 2019. 
Finally, we continue to make material investments in our business at a level similar to 2018, with the intention of further differentiating our products and services. In 2019, we expect solid top line growth while also achieving modest positive operating leverage in our advisory and outsourcing businesses. We will discuss all of this and more in detail at our Investor Day, and we look forward to seeing everyone in New York on March 7. 
Before I close, let me thank everyone at CBRE for another outstanding year in 2018. We are very proud of their dedicated efforts on behalf of our clients and our shareholders.

I mean, our -- in -- typical deal infill multiples are still in the plus or minus 6 range on average. If you have a unique deal that's more of a software platform or something like that, obviously, that'll trade differently. But the traditional infill M&A-type transactions have been trading in a pretty steady range or at least with the deals that we've done."

First of all, there's a lot of debt and equity capital available that still wants to get into commercial real estate. Assets are in really good shape. Occupancies are going up. Rental rates are going up, which is attractive to investors in commercial real estate. And the base of assets around the world is growing. We're now potentially going to see some new development in New York that we haven't seen for a while. So I think all of that suggests -- of course, unless problems emerge, given what's going on geopolitically and in trade, et cetera, I think we should see another solid year for building sales. Probably, the marketplace, in general, won't be quite as active as it was in 2018, but we expect to grow our business because we expect to take some market share. We've added some professionals and things we've done historically. By the way, what's going on with interest rates is probably a good thing for asset sales. The momentum to raise interest rates has diminished, and we think that's a good thing."

And we're growing our business now on an organic basis by a large amount each year. Annual growth is equal to the size of some of the fairly large customers -- competitors that are now in the marketplace. And so you have to look at all the opportunities and compare them against one another."

We study that all the time and ask the question with our management team, with our strategy team, with our board, should we go into adjacent areas? The choices we make for the time being are that we're going to go into this experience market with our Host offering more aggressively. We've made the choice to go into the co-working or flexible space market with Hana. Obviously, in this last cycle, we escalated materially our participation in multifamily. We think that was a really good call. We have now a sizable multifamily development business, and we've always had a sizable multifamily trading and financing business. But for the most part, we like the businesses we're in, and we see opportunities all over our business to expand. We don't have 10% market share globally in anything we do, and we're constantly scanning our lines of business and our geographies for places where we think we can do more. By the way, this reorganization should really help in that regard. So let's take our advisory business. If you went back to the organizational structure we had last year and before and look across the geographies, to a degree, among our leadership team, we had co-mingled our outsourcing business and our advisory business, our brokerage businesses. We're going to have much more focus now. We have mechanisms to ensure synergy between the two. But we're going to have much more focus. And if you were to ask Mike Lafitte, the Global Head of our advisory business, what he's going to do. We have 12 divisional presidents around the world in that advisory business. And one of the things he's going to ask them to focus on in each major market is understanding whether or not we're the leader in lease -- in occupier leasing, we're the leader in agency leasing, whether we're the leader in capital markets and financing and understand that deeply and to the extent we aren't, go after it. That's one of the reasons we're so confident that this reorganization is going to be powerful. And so the fact of the matter is, we largely like the products were in, but we see plenty of holes and opportunities for improvement."

When you look at our leasing activity and you look at the leasing activity of our good competitors, it's much bigger than just flexible workspace. We had a question a minute ago, why only 3% when the market absorption is 20%? Well, first of all, that's just office space, right? We do a lot -- we lease -- we do a lot of leasing, obviously, in the industrial space. We do leasing in the retail space. But there is an awful lot of what's going on in the leasing world. We represent most big occupiers around the world. Most big occupiers around the world, the majority of their leasing will still be in spaces that are not co-working spaces. And so we don't think on the margin that what we're doing with Hana or what our clients out in the market space that are in the agile or co-working arena, do -- will have a big impact on our leasing business. Certainly not for the foreseeable future. Now if co-working didn't go to 10%, but in fact, went to 20% or 30%, then maybe we'd move more in the direction of Hana and see a little bit of back pressure on our leasing, but we're not seeing it now."

Our business ended the year with broad strength across geographies and business lines. The fourth quarter was highlighted by 16% fee revenue growth in our regional services businesses, with positive operating leverage in those businesses driven by leasing and Occupier Outsourcing. This led to adjusted EPS growth of 26% for the quarter. 
For the year, adjusted EPS rose 20% on 15% growth in fee revenue. This marks our ninth consecutive year of double-digit increases in adjusted EPS. Our results for both the quarter and the year reflect the operational gains in capital investments we have made to enable our people to produce hard-to-replicate client outcomes. 
Our leasing business is a good example. We repositioned this business 4 years ago in response to client appetite for greater advisory services, and now have more than 1,000 dedicated specialists working alongside our transaction professionals. They advise clients on workplace design and employee experience, labor and location analytics, government incentives and supply chain optimization among other things. No competitor has the capacity to invest in advisory capabilities to the same degree that CBRE has. This is creating competitive differentiation and contributing to strong leasing revenue growth, particularly with account-based clients.
While we were having one of our best quarters on record, we also work diligently to prepare for the reorganization that took effect on January 1. The structure puts several of our sectors' very best leaders in compelling new leadership roles, sharpens our focus on excellence across our services and enables operating efficiencies across our business. These moves are already having an impact, and we expect them to come through in our financial performance in 2019.
Before I hand the call over to Jim, I'll comment on the plan we announced in January to split his responsibilities. Our scale and financial strength, much of which resulted from Jim's excellent work, gives CBRE unique advantages as an investor in our sector. Jim is a savvy investor with a proven long-term record of successfully allocating and deploying capital. We will benefit greatly from his exclusive focus in this critically important area. I want to thank Jim for his many contributions as our CFO. Our search for a new CFO is progressing nicely.
Now Jim will discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and the year in more detail."

Before discussing our performance, I want to say how much I am looking forward to devoting my full attention to allocating and investing our capital. We have built up considerable investment capacity and anticipate great opportunities to deploy capital over time to add value for our shareholders and capabilities for our clients. I also look forward to working closely with our new CFO. 
As Bob noted, CBRE had an outstanding quarter and year. Fee revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, each reached all-time highs with double-digit growth across all metrics.
For the quarter, consolidated fee revenue rose 18% in local currency. Growth in the quarter was predominantly organic. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% and adjusted EPS increased 26%, both in U.S. dollars. For the year, adjusted EBITDA exceeded $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.28, increased 20% over prior year. Our full year adjusted net income margin of 10.4% on fee revenue is up 50 basis points over 2017 and is a new record high for CBRE.
Our balance sheet is very well positioned for the future. At year-end, net debt was only 0.6x 2018 adjusted EBITDA. Late in the quarter, we borrowed EUR 400 million on a new term loan and used the proceeds to repay U.S. dollar term loans. We expect this transaction to reduce our annual interest expense by about $12 million, while also reducing the FX translation risk from our European business.  In addition, we launched a refresh of our existing USD 2.8 billion line of credit for a new 5-year term that we expect to close in March.
We also took advantage of volatility in the equity markets to buy back over $200 million of our stock. Through early January, we opportunistically acquired 5.1 million shares at an average price of $40.20 per share.
Finally, I want to remind everyone that as we discussed last quarter, we are introducing our new segment disclosures at our Investor Day in 3 weeks. We'll be providing guidance based on those new segments at that time. Please hold your questions about our 2019 forecast until our Investor Day.
Please turn to Slide 6, which details the revenue performance of our major lines of business for Q4. Leasing was incredibly strong this quarter globally, with a 24% increase over last year. All 3 regions produced double-digit increases. As Bob noted earlier, account-based work is representing a growing portion of our leasing business, and this was certainly the case in the fourth quarter. Americas led with leasing up 27%, mostly driven by 29% growth in the U.S. on top of 16% growth in Q4 of the prior year. M&A contributed about 4%. 
The accelerating growth of flexible office solutions was also a tailwind, and we estimate that working with flexible space operators and placing our customers in their space accounted for 3% of our U.S. growth. The remainder is explained by market share gains and the strong overall leasing market.
Our U.S. leasing business saw increases in the number of transactions, average square footage and price per square foot. Given the continued economic strength, companies are adding incremental office space and trading up to newer, more modern space.
Global property sales revenue increased 10%, led by the Americas with a 13% increase. 10% growth in Asia Pacific was notably led by China. While there is uncertainty around trade in China, we have seen high levels of investment activity from both foreign and domestic capital. Investments in our team and platform in China are also driving growth in the business.
Our commercial mortgage origination business showed continued strength with 16% revenue growth. In 2018, CBRE originated the most agency multifamily mortgages in the U.S. for the fifth time in 6 years. We were also the #1 Freddie Mac originator for the 10th year in a row. Strong originations in the quarter helped our loan servicing portfolio cross the $200 billion mark, and recurring servicing revenues rose 20% for the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 7, which highlights our Occupier Outsourcing business, which as Bob mentioned, had another quarter of impressive growth. Fee revenue rose 20% for the quarter and 19% for the year. This was driven by strong organic growth of 16% for the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth has been driven by an ability to create value for our clients with an unmatched platform. The depth and breadth of our platform has been materially enhanced in recent years with the successful integrations of Noland, JCI's Global Workplace Solutions business and FacilitySource, along with numerous smaller specialty firms.
As an example, in the fourth quarter, we combined the capabilities of FacilitySource, which we acquired in June, with the strength of our existing outsourcing platform to win one of our largest ever facility management contracts with a new outsourcing client. These combined capabilities allowed CBRE to provide a tailored client solution that could not be matched by others.
An example of an expanding existing relationship is Uber. In the fourth quarter, Uber ordered us a global mandate to provide a full suite of outsourcing services, including strategic consulting and transactions, facilities and project management for its 6 million square foot portfolio. Investments in digital and technology capabilities and our CBRE 360 workplace experience service, which we recently renamed Host, were important in differentiating our offering. With growing capabilities in a record year-end pipeline, this business is poised for another year of solid double-digit growth.
Please turn to Slide 8, which summarizes our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue was up 18%, driven by growth in asset management and incentive fees and higher carried interest. Adjusted EBITDA rose 7% in the quarter, despite a mark-to-market loss of $7 million on co-investments in public securities in a turbulent quarter. These co-investment losses have since reversed with improved public markets in January.
We continue to attract significant capital due to our record of generating very good returns for our fund and separate account investors. Capital raising rose 10% during 2018 to $10.9 billion, a record for the company. Assets Under Management increased by $1 billion in U.S. dollars from the prior quarter to $105.5 billion. For the year, AUM increased $2.3 billion in U.S. dollars and $5.1 billion in local currency.
Please turn to Slide 9, which summarizes our Development Services segment. This business had a remarkable year with $185 million of adjusted EBITDA, up 55% over prior year. $34 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was on par with a strong Q4 2017. Our developments in process reached a record level of $9 billion, a strong indicator of anticipated activity over the next few years.
As a reminder, this business consumes relatively little capital. We had $100 million invested in development projects at year-end 2018 and just $8 million of repayment guarantees on outstanding debt balances.
Following 2018's record performance, we expect 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be closer to 2017, which was our next strongest year ever.
Now please turn to Slide 10 for Bob's closing remarks."

We start the new year with excellent momentum across our global business. Our people are energized and aligned behind our strategy. Our new organizational structure will allow them to take maximum advantage of CBRE's scale and resources and growing suite of technology tools.
Globally, the economy is expected to grow at a healthy but moderately slower pace than in 2018. Cross-border capital flows are solid, notwithstanding the ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions. While we remain mindful of potential macro challenges and the length of the current economic expansion, this continues to be a supportive environment for our business.
As always, transaction volumes are difficult to forecast, however, we expect solid revenue growth in our transaction businesses in 2019, supported by market share gains. We also see strong continued momentum in real estate outsourcing as interest accelerates in new sectors and customers expand existing mandates. 
In addition, our competitive advantages continued to strengthen, driven by large investments in strategic acquisitions and strong operational and technology gains. This portends another year of strong growth for our outsourcing business in 2019. 
Finally, we continue to make material investments in our business at a level similar to 2018, with the intention of further differentiating our products and services. In 2019, we expect solid top line growth while also achieving modest positive operating leverage in our advisory and outsourcing businesses. We will discuss all of this and more in detail at our Investor Day, and we look forward to seeing everyone in New York on March 7. 
Before I close, let me thank everyone at CBRE for another outstanding year in 2018. We are very proud of their dedicated efforts on behalf of our clients and our shareholders.

First of all, there's a lot of debt and equity capital available that still wants to get into commercial real estate. Assets are in really good shape. Occupancies are going up.

We're now potentially going to see some new development in New York that we haven't seen for a while. So I think all of that suggests -- of course, unless problems emerge, given what's going on geopolitically and in trade, et cetera, I think we should see another solid year for building sales. Probably, the marketplace, in general, won't be quite as active as it was in 2018, but we expect to grow our business because we expect to take some market share. We've added some professionals and things we've done historically. By the way, what's going on with interest rates is probably a good thing for asset sales.

Obviously, you've read research reports by others that suggest it could go much higher than that. We've studied it very closely. We think it's very real. We think that -- let's looks at our big occupier clients. We know for sure that those occupier clients want to have a lot of the space that they are in, be space they own. We know that they want to have a lot of the space they're in, be space they lease that's exclusively for them. But we also know that on the margin, they like to be able to have a chunk of their space for employees that move around the world or employees that are part of a team that's just forming and maybe absorbed into something else later, things like that. They like the notion of flexible space. And so we think this opportunity is real, we think it's going to grow, and we are very oriented toward participating in it in a variety of ways."

We study that all the time and ask the question with our management team, with our strategy team, with our board, should we go into adjacent areas? The choices we make for the time being are that we're going to go into this experience market with our Host offering more aggressively. We've made the choice to go into the co-working or flexible space market with Hana. Obviously, in this last cycle, we escalated materially our participation in multifamily. We think that was a really good call. We have now a sizable multifamily development business, and we've always had a sizable multifamily trading and financing business. But for the most part, we like the businesses we're in, and we see opportunities all over our business to expand. We don't have 10% market share globally in anything we do, and we're constantly scanning our lines of business and our geographies for places where we think we can do more. By the way, this reorganization should really help in that regard. So let's take our advisory business. If you went back to the organizational structure we had last year and before and look across the geographies, to a degree, among our leadership team, we had co-mingled our outsourcing business and our advisory business, our brokerage businesses. We're going to have much more focus now. We have mechanisms to ensure synergy between the two. But we're going to have much more focus. And if you were to ask Mike Lafitte, the Global Head of our advisory business, what he's going to do. We have 12 divisional presidents around the world in that advisory business. And one of the things he's going to ask them to focus on in each major market is understanding whether or not we're the leader in lease -- in occupier leasing, we're the leader in agency leasing, whether we're the leader in capital markets and financing and understand that deeply and to the extent we aren't, go after it. That's one of the reasons we're so confident that this reorganization is going to be powerful. And so the fact of the matter is, we largely like the products were in, but we see plenty of holes and opportunities for improvement."

We do a lot -- we lease -- we do a lot of leasing, obviously, in the industrial space. We do leasing in the retail space. But there is an awful lot of what's going on in the leasing world. We represent most big occupiers around the world. Most big occupiers around the world, the majority of their leasing will still be in spaces that are not co-working spaces. And so we don't think on the margin that what we're doing with Hana or what our clients out in the market space that are in the agile or co-working arena, do -- will have a big impact on our leasing business. Certainly not for the foreseeable future. Now if co-working didn't go to 10%, but in fact, went to 20% or 30%, then maybe we'd move more in the direction of Hana and see a little bit of back pressure on our leasing, but we're not seeing it now."

CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our 3 business segments drove increases of 29%",427,"Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our 3 business segments drove increases of 29% in adjusted EBITDA and 46% in adjusted EPS. 
The organizational changes we announced last year are improving our lines of business and helping to make us a more efficient client-focused company. For example, our 2 real estate services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, realized a combined 190 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins from last year's first quarter. 
Revenue growth was paced by another outstanding quarter for leasing, which increased by 22%. Leasing continues to benefit from both solid market fundamentals and market share gains. These gains are being driven by an offering for both one-off transactions and account-based clients that is increasingly differentiated within our industry. Leasing growth is also supported by strong recruiting. We are able to attract talented producers who tell us they can achieve more at CBRE than they can anywhere else. This speaks to the strength and differentiation of the CBRE platform. 
Our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which serves large account-based clients, again saw a fee revenue increase by double digits in local currency. This business had an outstanding quarter for new account wins, and our active pipeline has now more than doubled in size in the past 2 years. 
Finally, our Real Estate investment segment had a strong quarter, with excellent adjusted EBITDA growth from real estate development. While development results can vary quarter-to-quarter, the long-term performance of our business has been outstanding. Our new flexible space initiative, Hana, has signed its first 2 deals with property owners and has a very active pipeline, with additional property owner partnerships expected to be announced in the near future. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to thank Jim for his many accomplishments as our CFO. As we have discussed before, this will be Jim's last quarterly earnings call as he focuses full-time on his Chief Investment Officer responsibilities where he will do great things for the company. We're excited to welcome Leo Stearns to CBRE as our next Chief Financial Officer. Leah will join us from American Tower Corporation next Wednesday. Leah is an outstanding leader with a strong financial and operational background and extensive international and commercial real estate experience. I know you will enjoy interacting with her as our new CFO. Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

Should be a great addition to our executive team, and I look forward to working with her. Now please turn to Slide 5. This is the first quarter where we are reporting results under our new business segments. And as a result, we are providing further incremental transparency into our performance. To help you with this transition, we have restated historical quarterly data under our new segments back to the first quarter of 2017. We have also provided supplemental reports under our prior geographic reporting methodology. Both are posted in Excel files on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Turning to the quarters. Bob noted CBRE had a great start to 2019, with growth of 46% in adjusted EPS and 29% in adjusted EBITDA, almost all of which was organic. We appear to be on track for the tenth consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions segments combined experienced 14% revenue growth and 11% fee revenue growth, both in local currency. 
22% adjusted EBITDA growth in U.S. dollars and 190 basis point expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue. The increase in margins was driven by double-digit fee revenue growth, a favorable business mix and cost discipline. The net impact of a handful of choppier items, such as mortgage servicing gains and fluctuations in currency, drove approximately 1/4 of this margin expansion in the quarter. 
We also had strong performance in our Real Estate Investment segment, with adjusted EBITDA increasing $37 million over the prior year. Within this segment, investment Management benefited from co-investment gains and development benefited from several larger dispositions. GAAP earnings in the quarter were negatively affected by the noncash writedown of intangibles in our Real Estate Securities Investment Management business. As we have discussed previously, this business has been impacted by the industrywide shift in investor preferences to passive investment programs. The Securities business now comprises less than 10% of AUM in our Investment Management business. 
Finally, Moody's recognized the strength of our balance sheet with an upgrade last week to BAA1 in line with our BBB+ rating from S&P. 
Now please turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our Advisory Services segment. This segment includes our core services listed on the right-hand side of the slide. For the quarter, this segment realized adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% in U.S. dollars despite the drag from lower property sales on fee revenue growth of 10%. Performance was led by our leasing business, which had another great quarter, increasing globally by 22%, and growth was almost entirely organic. In the U.S., leasing was up 28%, with strong demand from multiple sectors, including Consumer Products, Energy and Technology. 
We benefited from several large deals, outsized growth from account-based clients and ongoing recruiting gains. With growth in leasing revenues for the trailing 12 months averaging over 20%, comparisons going forward will be more challenging. Loan servicing revenue grew 10% and our portfolio increased to a record $210 billion. Capital markets revenue, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage origination, declined by 1% globally, reflecting meaningful gains in market share. Within Capital markets, commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 13% fueled by robust activity with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises as well as banks. Property sales revenue declined 5% against a challenging 11% growth comparison in the prior year, though comparisons become easier going forward. The decline in property sales reflects a tepid macro environment, with marketwide sales volume decreased in all 3 global regions. Despite the softer quarter, we continue to take share in our property sales business. A modest 1% decline in U.S. sales revenue reflects significant market share gains as estimated market volumes decreased 8% according to Real Capital Analytics. 
Overall, America's property sales declined 4% driven by Canada, which faced a 31% prior year growth comparison. International growth in sales was negatively impacted by weakness in our residential sales businesses in Australia and Singapore, which offset otherwise strong performance particularly in Greater China and Japan. Adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue margin expansion of 200 basis points for the Advisory Services segment was driven by overall solid revenue growth, a favorable business mix and heightened focus on cost discipline. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our Global Workplace Solutions segment, sometimes referred to as our Outsourcing business. This segment achieved fee revenue growth of 12% in local currency and 8% in U.S. dollars. All 3 regions posted double-digit growth in local currency on top of strong double-digit growth in Q1 of the prior year. FX was a particularly challenging headwind in the quarter but should moderate as the year progresses. 
Global Workplace Solutions adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in U.S. dollars, reflecting strong operating leverage. We started the year by winning several large new contracts, making it our strongest ever first quarter for new business wins. By example, we significantly expanded our relationship with Lowe's Home Recruitment by combining our traditional Facilities Management strengths with the FacilitySource technology and services capabilities that we acquired last year. 
FacilitySource had a small pilot program with Lowe's in place at the time of the acquisition. With this new contract, we now manage 196 million square feet for Lowe's nationally. We expect FacilitySource will continue to drive growth with clients that have large, widely-dispersed operations. With a record pipeline of pursuits, Global Workplace Solutions is off to an excellent start to 2019. 
Now please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our Real Estate Investments segment. This segment includes our Investment Management business, which includes contractual asset management fees, our development business and Hana, our flexible space solutions business. First quarter EBITDA growth of $37 million in this segment exceeded our own expectations. Investment management capital raising set a new record at $13 billion over the past 12 months. Assets Under Management increased by $1.7 billion in the quarter to reach a new height at more than $107 billion. Investment Management contributed $6 million to adjusted EBITDA growth, co-investment returns totaled $13 million, driven by the strong rebound in public equity prices in Q1, more than offsetting the decline in carried interest revenue versus last year. 
The development business continues to exhibit excellent momentum, contributing $36 million to adjusted EBITDA growth driven by several large asset sales, including an office disposition that had been budgeted for later in the year. In-process activity also reached a record level, totaling $9.7 billion at the end of Q1. As you know, EBITDA from our development business can be choppy from quarter-to-quarter. Last year, the second and third quarters generated the majority of our EBITDA. This year, we expect the bulk of our EBITDA from development to be generated in the first and fourth quarters. 
Finally, Hana incurred startup costs in line with our expectations. In its early stages, Hana is being very well received, filling a marketplace need for property owners looking to participate in the powerful flexible space trend. Now please turn to Slide 9 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our 3 business segments drove increases of 29%",429,"Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our 3 business segments drove increases of 29% in adjusted EBITDA and 46% in adjusted EPS.
The organizational changes we announced last year are improving our lines of business and helping to make us a more efficient client-focused company. For example, our 2 real estate services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, realized a combined 190 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins from last year's first quarter.
Revenue growth was paced by another outstanding quarter for leasing, which increased by 22%. Leasing continues to benefit from both solid market fundamentals and market share gains. These gains are being driven by an offering for both one-off transactions and account-based clients that is increasingly differentiated within our industry. Leasing growth is also supported by strong recruiting. We were able to attract talented producers who tell us they can achieve more at CBRE than they can anywhere else. This speaks to the strength and differentiation of the CBRE platform.
Our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which serves large account-based clients, again saw a fee revenue increase by double digits in local currency. This business had an outstanding quarter for new account wins, and our active pipeline has now more than doubled in size in the past 2 years.
Finally, our Real Estate Investments segment had a strong quarter, with excellent adjusted EBITDA growth from real estate development. While development results can vary quarter to quarter, the long-term performance of our business has been outstanding. Our new flexible space initiative, Hana, has signed its first 2 deals with property owners and has a very active pipeline, with additional property owner partnerships expected to be announced in the near future.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to thank Jim for his many accomplishments as our CFO. As we have discussed before, this will be Jim's last quarterly earnings call as he focuses full-time on his Chief Investment Officer responsibilities where he will do great things for the company. We're excited to welcome Leah Stearns to CBRE as our next Chief Financial Officer. Leah will join us from American Tower Corporation next Wednesday. Leah is an outstanding leader with a strong financial and operational background and extensive international and commercial real estate experience. I know you will enjoy interacting with her as our new CFO. Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

Should be a great addition to our executive team, and I look forward to working with her. Now please turn to Slide 5. This is the first quarter where we are reporting results under our new business segments. And as a result, we are providing further incremental transparency into our performance. To help you with this transition, we have restated historical quarterly data under our new segments back to the first quarter of 2017. We have also provided supplemental reports under our prior geographic reporting methodology. Both are posted in Excel files on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Turning to the quarters. Bob noted CBRE had a great start to 2019, with growth of 46% in adjusted EPS and 29% in adjusted EBITDA, almost all of which was organic. We appear to be on track for a 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions segments combined experienced 14% revenue growth and 11% fee revenue growth, both in local currency, 22% adjusted EBITDA growth in U.S. dollars and 190 basis point expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue. The increase in margins was driven by double-digit fee revenue growth, a favorable business mix and cost discipline. The net impact of a handful of choppier items, such as mortgage servicing gains and fluctuations in currency, drove approximately 1/4 of this margin expansion in the quarter.
We also had strong performance in our Real Estate Investments segment, with adjusted EBITDA increasing $37 million over the prior year. Within this segment, Investment Management benefited from co-investment gains and Development benefited from several larger dispositions. GAAP earnings in the quarter were negatively affected by the noncash write-down of intangibles in our real estate securities investment management business. As we have discussed previously, this business has been impacted by the industry-wide shift in investor preferences to passive investment programs. The securities business now comprises less than 10% of AUM in our Investment Management business.
Finally, Moody's recognized the strength of our balance sheet with an upgrade last week to Baa1 in line with our BBB+ rating from S&P.
Now please turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our Advisory Services segment. This segment includes our core services listed on the right-hand side of the slide. For the quarter, this segment realized adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% in U.S. dollars despite the drag from lower property sales on fee revenue growth of 10%. Performance was led by our leasing business, which had another great quarter, increasing globally by 22%, and growth was almost entirely organic. In the U.S., leasing was up 28%, with strong demand from multiple sectors, including consumer products, energy and technology.
We benefited from several large deals, outsized growth from account-based clients and ongoing recruiting gains. With growth in leasing revenues for the trailing 12 months averaging over 20%, comparisons going forward will be more challenging. Loan servicing revenue grew 10%, and our portfolio increased to a record $210 billion. Capital markets revenue, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage origination, declined by 1% globally, reflecting meaningful gains in market share. Within Capital markets, commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 13% fueled by robust activity with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises as well as banks. Property sales revenue declined 5% against a challenging 11% growth comparison in the prior year, though comparisons become easier going forward. The decline in property sales reflect a tepid macro environment, with market-wide sales volume decreased in all 3 global regions. Despite the softer quarter, we continue to take share in our property sales business. A modest 1% decline in U.S. sales revenue reflects significant market share gains as estimated market volumes decreased 8% according to Real Capital Analytics. 
Overall, America's property sales declined 4% driven by Canada, which faced a 31% prior year growth comparison. International growth in sales was negatively impacted by weakness in our residential sales businesses in Australia and Singapore, which offset otherwise strong performance, particularly in Greater China and Japan. Adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue margin expansion of 200 basis points for the Advisory Services segment was driven by overall solid revenue growth, a favorable business mix and heightened focus on cost discipline. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our Global Workplace Solutions segment, sometimes referred to as our outsourcing business. This segment achieved fee revenue growth of 12% in local currency and 8% in U.S. dollars. All 3 regions posted double-digit growth in local currency on top of strong double-digit growth in Q1 of the prior year. FX was a particularly challenging headwind in the quarter but should moderate as the year progresses.
Global Workplace Solutions adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in U.S. dollars, reflecting strong operating leverage. We started the year by winning several large new contracts, making it our strongest-ever first quarter for new business wins. By example, we significantly expanded our relationship with Lowe's Home Improvement by combining our traditional Facilities Management strengths with the FacilitySource technology and services capabilities that we acquired last year.
FacilitySource had a small pilot program with Lowe's in place at the time of the acquisition. With this new contract, we now manage 196 million square feet for Lowe's nationally. We expect FacilitySource will continue to drive growth with clients that have large, widely dispersed operations. With a record pipeline of pursuits, Global Workplace Solutions is off to an excellent start to 2019.
Now please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our Real Estate Investments segment. This segment includes our Investment Management business, which includes contractual asset management fees, our development business and Hana, our flexible space solutions business. First quarter EBITDA growth of $37 million in this segment exceeded our own expectations. Investment management capital raising set a new record at $13 billion over the past 12 months. Assets Under Management increased by $1.7 billion in the quarter to reach a new height at more than $107 billion. Investment Management contributed $6 million to adjusted EBITDA growth, co-investment returns totaled $13 million, driven by the strong rebound in public equity prices in Q1, more than offsetting the decline in carried interest revenue versus last year.
The development business continues to exhibit excellent momentum, contributing $36 million to adjusted EBITDA growth driven by several large asset sales, including an office disposition that had been budgeted for later in the year. In-process activity also reached a record level, totaling $9.7 billion at the end of Q1. As you know, EBITDA from our development business can be choppy from quarter to quarter. Last year, the second and third quarters generated the majority of our EBITDA. This year, we expect the bulk of our EBITDA from development to be generated in the first and fourth quarters.
Finally, Hana incurred startup costs in line with our expectations. In its early stages, Hana is being very well received, filling a marketplace need for property owners looking to participate in the powerful flexible space trend. Now please turn to Slide 9 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our 3 business segments drove increases of 29%",429,"Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our 3 business segments drove increases of 29% in adjusted EBITDA and 46% in adjusted EPS.
The organizational changes we announced last year are improving our lines of business and helping to make us a more efficient client-focused company. For example, our 2 real estate services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, realized a combined 190 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins from last year's first quarter.
Revenue growth was paced by another outstanding quarter for leasing, which increased by 22%. Leasing continues to benefit from both solid market fundamentals and market share gains. These gains are being driven by an offering for both one-off transactions and account-based clients that is increasingly differentiated within our industry. Leasing growth is also supported by strong recruiting. We are able to attract talented producers who tell us they can achieve more at CBRE than they can anywhere else. This speaks to the strength and differentiation of the CBRE platform.
Our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which serves large account-based clients, again saw a fee revenue increase by double digits in local currency. This business had an outstanding quarter for new account wins, and our active pipeline has now more than doubled in size in the past 2 years.
Finally, our Real Estate Investments segment had a strong quarter, with excellent adjusted EBITDA growth from real estate development. While development results can vary quarter to quarter, the long-term performance of our business has been outstanding. Our new flexible space initiative, Hana, has signed its first 2 deals with property owners and has a very active pipeline, with additional property owner partnerships expected to be announced in the near future.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to thank Jim for his many accomplishments as our CFO. As we have discussed before, this will be Jim's last quarterly earnings call as he focuses full-time on his Chief Investment Officer responsibilities, where he will do great things for the company. We're excited to welcome Leah Stearns to CBRE as our next Chief Financial Officer. Leah will join us from American Tower Corporation next Wednesday. Leah is an outstanding leader with a strong financial and operational background and extensive international and commercial real estate experience. I know you will enjoy interacting with her as our new CFO. Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

She'll be a great addition to our executive team, and I look forward to working with her. Now please turn to Slide 5.

She'll be a great addition to our executive team, and I look forward to working with her. Now please turn to Slide 5. This is the first quarter where we are reporting results under our new business segments. And as a result, we are providing further incremental transparency into our performance. To help you with this transition, we have restated historical quarterly data under our new segments back to the first quarter of 2017. We have also provided supplemental reports under our prior geographic reporting methodology. Both are posted in Excel files on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Turning to the quarter. As Bob noted, CBRE had a great start to 2019, with growth of 46% in adjusted EPS and 29% in adjusted EBITDA, almost all of which was organic. We appear to be on track for a 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions segments combined experienced 14% revenue growth and 11% fee revenue growth, both in local currency, 22% adjusted EBITDA growth in U.S. dollars and 190 basis point expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue. The increase in margins was driven by double-digit fee revenue growth, a favorable business mix and cost discipline. The net impact of a handful of choppier items, such as mortgage servicing gains and fluctuations in currency, drove approximately 1/4 of this margin expansion in the quarter.
We also had strong performance in our Real Estate Investments segment, with adjusted EBITDA increasing $37 million over the prior year. Within this segment, Investment Management benefited from co-investment gains and Development benefited from several larger dispositions. GAAP earnings in the quarter were negatively affected by the noncash write-down of intangibles in our real estate securities investment management business. As we have discussed previously, this business has been impacted by the industry-wide shift in investor preferences to passive investment programs. The securities business now comprises less than 10% of AUM in our Investment Management business.
Finally, Moody's recognized the strength of our balance sheet with an upgrade last week to Baa1 in line with our BBB+ rating from S&P.
Now please turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our Advisory Services segment. This segment includes our core services listed on the right-hand side of the slide. For the quarter, this segment realized adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% in U.S. dollars, despite the drag from lower property sales, on fee revenue growth of 10%. Performance was led by our leasing business, which had another great quarter, increasing globally by 22%, and growth was almost entirely organic. In the U.S., leasing was up 28%, with strong demand from multiple sectors, including consumer products, energy and technology.
We benefited from several large deals, outsized growth from account-based clients and ongoing recruiting gains. With growth in leasing revenues for the trailing 12 months averaging over 20%, comparisons going forward will be more challenging. Loan servicing revenue grew 10%, and our portfolio increased to a record $210 billion. Capital markets revenue, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage origination, declined by 1% globally, reflecting meaningful gains in market share. Within Capital markets, commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 13% fueled by robust activity with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises as well as banks. Property sales revenue declined 5% against a challenging 11% growth comparison in the prior year, though, comparisons become easier going forward. The decline in property sales reflect a tepid macro environment, with market-wide sales volume decreased in all 3 global regions. Despite the softer quarter, we continue to take share in our property sales business. A modest 1% decline in U.S. sales revenue reflects significant market share gains as estimated market volumes decreased 8% according to Real Capital Analytics. 
Overall, Americas property sales declined 4% driven by Canada, which faced a 31% prior year growth comparison. International growth in sales was negatively impacted by weakness in our residential sales businesses in Australia and Singapore, which offset otherwise strong performance, particularly in Greater China and Japan. Adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue margin expansion of 200 basis points for the Advisory Services segment was driven by overall solid revenue growth, a favorable business mix and heightened focus on cost discipline. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our Global Workplace Solutions segment, sometimes referred to as our outsourcing business. This segment achieved fee revenue growth of 12% in local currency and 8% in U.S. dollars. All 3 regions posted double-digit growth in local currency on top of strong double-digit growth in Q1 of the prior year. FX was a particularly challenging headwind in the quarter but should moderate as the year progresses.
Global Workplace Solutions adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in U.S. dollars, reflecting strong operating leverage. We started the year by winning several large new contracts, making it our strongest-ever first quarter for new business wins. By example, we significantly expanded our relationship with Lowe's Home Improvement by combining our traditional Facilities Management strengths with the FacilitySource technology and services capabilities that we acquired last year.
FacilitySource had a small pilot program with Lowe's in place at the time of the acquisition. With this new contract, we now manage 196 million square feet for Lowe's nationally. We expect FacilitySource will continue to drive growth with clients that have large, widely dispersed operations. With a record pipeline of pursuits, Global Workplace Solutions is off to an excellent start to 2019.
Now please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our Real Estate Investments segment. This segment includes our Investment Management business, which includes contractual asset management fees, our development business and Hana, our flexible space solutions business. First quarter EBITDA growth of $37 million in this segment exceeded our own expectations. Investment management capital raising set a new record at $13 billion over the past 12 months. Assets Under Management increased by $1.7 billion in the quarter to reach a new height at more than $107 billion. Investment Management contributed $6 million to adjusted EBITDA growth, co-investment returns totaled $13 million driven by the strong rebound in public equity prices in Q1 more than offsetting the decline in carried interest revenue versus last year.
The development business continues to exhibit excellent momentum, contributing $36 million to adjusted EBITDA growth driven by several large asset sales, including an office disposition that had been budgeted for later in the year. In-process activity also reached a record level, totaling $9.7 billion at the end of Q1. As you know, EBITDA from our development business can be choppy from quarter to quarter. Last year, the second and third quarters generated the majority of our EBITDA. This year, we expect the bulk of our EBITDA from development to be generated in the first and fourth quarters.
Finally, Hana incurred startup costs in line with our expectations. In its early stages, Hana is being very well received, filling a marketplace need for property owners looking to participate in the powerful flexible space trend. Now please turn to Slide 9 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our 3 business segments drove increases of 29%",429,"Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE had an excellent start to 2019 as the positive momentum we experienced last year carried over into the first quarter. Strong operating leverage across each of our 3 business segments drove increases of 29% in adjusted EBITDA and 46% in adjusted EPS.
The organizational changes we announced last year are improving our lines of business and helping to make us a more efficient client-focused company. For example, our 2 real estate services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, realized a combined 190 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins from last year's first quarter.
Revenue growth was paced by another outstanding quarter for leasing, which increased by 22%. Leasing continues to benefit from both solid market fundamentals and market share gains. These gains are being driven by an offering for both one-off transactions and account-based clients that is increasingly differentiated within our industry. Leasing growth is also supported by strong recruiting. We are able to attract talented producers who tell us they can achieve more at CBRE than they can anywhere else. This speaks to the strength and differentiation of the CBRE platform.
Our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which serves large account-based clients, again saw a fee revenue increase by double digits in local currency. This business had an outstanding quarter for new account wins, and our active pipeline has now more than doubled in size in the past 2 years.
Finally, our Real Estate Investments segment had a strong quarter, with excellent adjusted EBITDA growth from real estate development. While development results can vary quarter to quarter, the long-term performance of our business has been outstanding. Our new flexible space initiative, Hana, has signed its first 2 deals with property owners and has a very active pipeline, with additional property owner partnerships expected to be announced in the near future.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to thank Jim for his many accomplishments as our CFO. As we have discussed before, this will be Jim's last quarterly earnings call as he focuses full-time on his Chief Investment Officer responsibilities where he will do great things for the company. We're excited to welcome Leah Stearns to CBRE as our next Chief Financial Officer. Leah will join us from American Tower Corporation next Wednesday. Leah is an outstanding leader with a strong financial and operational background and extensive international and commercial real estate experience. I know you will enjoy interacting with her as our new CFO. Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

She'll be a great addition to our executive team, and I look forward to working with her. Now please turn to Slide 5. This is the first quarter where we are reporting results under our new business segments.",1181,"Thanks, Bob. I want to begin by welcoming Leah. She'll be a great addition to our executive team, and I look forward to working with her. Now please turn to Slide 5. This is the first quarter where we are reporting results under our new business segments. And as a result, we are providing further incremental transparency into our performance. To help you with this transition, we have restated historical quarterly data under our new segments back to the first quarter of 2017. We have also provided supplemental reports under our prior geographic reporting methodology. Both are posted in Excel files on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Turning to the quarter. As Bob noted, CBRE had a great start to 2019, with growth of 46% in adjusted EPS and 29% in adjusted EBITDA, almost all of which was organic. We appear to be on track for a 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions segments combined experienced 14% revenue growth and 11% fee revenue growth, both in local currency, 22% adjusted EBITDA growth in U.S. dollars and 190 basis point expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue. The increase in margins was driven by double-digit fee revenue growth, a favorable business mix and cost discipline. The net impact of a handful of choppier items, such as mortgage servicing gains and fluctuations in currency, drove approximately 1/4 of this margin expansion in the quarter.
We also had strong performance in our Real Estate Investments segment, with adjusted EBITDA increasing $37 million over the prior year. Within this segment, Investment Management benefited from co-investment gains and Development benefited from several larger dispositions. GAAP earnings in the quarter were negatively affected by the noncash write-down of intangibles in our real estate securities investment management business. As we have discussed previously, this business has been impacted by the industry-wide shift in investor preferences to passive investment programs. The securities business now comprises less than 10% of AUM in our Investment Management business.
Finally, Moody's recognized the strength of our balance sheet with an upgrade last week to Baa1 in line with our BBB+ rating from S&P.
Now please turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our Advisory Services segment. This segment includes our core services listed on the right-hand side of the slide. For the quarter, this segment realized adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% in U.S. dollars despite the drag from lower property sales on fee revenue growth of 10%. Performance was led by our leasing business, which had another great quarter, increasing globally by 22%, and growth was almost entirely organic. In the U.S., leasing was up 28%, with strong demand from multiple sectors, including consumer products, energy and technology.
We benefited from several large deals, outsized growth from account-based clients and ongoing recruiting gains. With growth in leasing revenues for the trailing 12 months averaging over 20%, comparisons going forward will be more challenging. Loan servicing revenue grew 10%, and our portfolio increased to a record $210 billion. Capital markets revenue, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage origination, declined by 1% globally, reflecting meaningful gains in market share. Within Capital markets, commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 13% fueled by robust activity with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises as well as banks. Property sales revenue declined 5% against a challenging 11% growth comparison in the prior year, though comparisons become easier going forward. The decline in property sales reflect a tepid macro environment, with market-wide sales volume decreased in all 3 global regions. Despite the softer quarter, we continue to take share in our property sales business. A modest 1% decline in U.S. sales revenue reflects significant market share gains as estimated market volumes decreased 8% according to Real Capital Analytics. 
Overall, Americas property sales declined 4% driven by Canada, which faced a 31% prior year growth comparison. International growth in sales was negatively impacted by weakness in our residential sales businesses in Australia and Singapore, which offset otherwise strong performance, particularly in Greater China and Japan. Adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue margin expansion of 200 basis points for the Advisory Services segment was driven by overall solid revenue growth, a favorable business mix and heightened focus on cost discipline. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our Global Workplace Solutions segment, sometimes referred to as our outsourcing business. This segment achieved fee revenue growth of 12% in local currency and 8% in U.S. dollars. All 3 regions posted double-digit growth in local currency on top of strong double-digit growth in Q1 of the prior year. FX was a particularly challenging headwind in the quarter but should moderate as the year progresses.
Global Workplace Solutions adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in U.S. dollars, reflecting strong operating leverage. We started the year by winning several large new contracts, making it our strongest-ever first quarter for new business wins. By example, we significantly expanded our relationship with Lowe's Home Improvement by combining our traditional Facilities Management strengths with the FacilitySource technology and services capabilities that we acquired last year.
FacilitySource had a small pilot program with Lowe's in place at the time of the acquisition. With this new contract, we now manage 196 million square feet for Lowe's nationally. We expect FacilitySource will continue to drive growth with clients that have large, widely dispersed operations. With a record pipeline of pursuits, Global Workplace Solutions is off to an excellent start to 2019.
Now please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our Real Estate Investments segment. This segment includes our Investment Management business, which includes contractual asset management fees, our development business and Hana, our flexible space solutions business. First quarter EBITDA growth of $37 million in this segment exceeded our own expectations. Investment management capital raising set a new record at $13 billion over the past 12 months. Assets Under Management increased by $1.7 billion in the quarter to reach a new height at more than $107 billion. Investment Management contributed $6 million to adjusted EBITDA growth, co-investment returns totaled $13 million driven by the strong rebound in public equity prices in Q1 more than offsetting the decline in carried interest revenue versus last year.
The development business continues to exhibit excellent momentum, contributing $36 million to adjusted EBITDA growth driven by several large asset sales, including an office disposition that had been budgeted for later in the year. In-process activity also reached a record level, totaling $9.7 billion at the end of Q1. As you know, EBITDA from our development business can be choppy from quarter to quarter. Last year, the second and third quarters generated the majority of our EBITDA. This year, we expect the bulk of our EBITDA from development to be generated in the first and fourth quarters.
Finally, Hana incurred startup costs in line with our expectations. In its early stages, Hana is being very well received, filling a marketplace need for property owners looking to participate in the powerful flexible space trend. Now please turn to Slide 9 for Bob's closing remarks."

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our second quarter results in 2019 outlook in more detail. After these comments will open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. 
Examples of the statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future that can cause actual results to differ mightily from those expressed in these forward looking statements. 
For a full discussion of the risk and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings press release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. 
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. 
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. 
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 11% over the prior year driven by our 2 services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, which together logged 12% fee revenue growth and 18% adjusted EBITDA growth. 
Revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based as every line of business within both of these segments increased over the prior year. 
In addition, adjusted EBITDA margins on fee revenue increased solidly in both our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segment, expanding by 90 basis points on a combined basis. 
Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment declined as expected from the prior year due to the timing of development dispositions and to a lesser extent, the cost associated with starting up Hana, our flexible space offering. Gains from our development business can vary due to the timing of a project disposition. And last year, we [indiscernible] gains from several significant projects during the second quarter. Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob."

As Brad just noted, we reported another quarter of strong growth for CBRE with double-digit revenue increases in our leasing, Occupier Outsourcing and U.S. capital markets businesses. 
In addition, the impact of our reorganization, which we announced last year, is driving margin improvement in our Advisory Services and Outsourcing businesses. 
Cost efficiency was one of the key objectives of this change. 
The continued strength in our leasing business is notable as lease revenue growth has averaged 20% over the past 5 quarters. While we have benefited from a healthy leasing market, our strong performance also reflects our increasingly differentiated capabilities. 
This is demonstrated by our success in winning new account-based business because of our ability to integrate advisory and [indiscernible] solutions in a single offering and to execute at a high level across markets. 
During the quarter, U.S. account-based leasing revenue increased 31% from the prior year. 
Large and sophisticated occupiers are asking CBRE for consultation and workplace design, deep expertise in industry sectors and a full suite of digital capabilities, and they want us to bring it all together with the top brokerage talent in the market. 
No firm in our industry is able to match the scale and capabilities of CBRE's leasing business. As a result, when CBRE competes for new account-based leasing mandates, more often than not, we win that business. 
Now I'd like to welcome Leah Stearns to our first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. We're extremely excited about the deep financial and operational background she brings to CBRE. 
Leah has already had a positive impact, and we know she will be a valued contributor to our senior leadership team."
4204816,628781700,1786854,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appeared to be stronger than",1531,"Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appeared to be stronger than ever. The evidence of this is clear. Over the last 5 years, CBRE has generated 13% annualized growth in adjusted EBITDA, 18% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and about 70% of total shareholder return. This has all been achieved while simultaneously diversifying the business and strengthening the balance sheet. 
These financial results have been supported by favorable secular trends, which we believe provide a solid foundation to the earnings our business generates. It's important to recognize that these catalysts show no signs of fatigue. 
The owners and occupiers of commercial real estate continue to become larger and they are increasingly sophisticated, and they want to work with large sophisticated service providers. Within our sector, CBRE has a powerful competitive position to address this customer demand, and I think that's underappreciated. 
Our global scale, the breadth of our services that we can offer and our ability to invest in digital capabilities are allowing us to pull away from the competition, and it's showing up in our financial performance. 
Further, real estate continues to show signs of strength, insulation capital allocation to real estate continue to rise. Simultaneously, debt [indiscernible] are declining while underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios in cap rates all remain largely stable. We see few signs of overbuilding as supply growth is meeting strong occupier demand. 
Bottom line, given our resilient and diversified business mix and strong balance sheet, CBRE is operating from a position of strength. 
As a result, we see tremendous opportunities ahead of us. And will remain opportunistic as we deploy capital into our business to maximize total shareholder return in the future. 
And with that, let's discuss our financial performance during the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA, which was driven by an 11% increase in the fee revenue and a 60-basis-point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior year period. Margins in the quarter benefited from both business mix and solid cost discipline as operating expenses rose just 2% on an adjusted basis. 
As Bob noted, leasing within our advisory business was once again particularly strong, increasing 19%. This was paced by the Americas, which generated 70% of our advisory fee revenue and grew 26%. 
During the quarter, co-working companies comprised about 3% of our Americas advisory leasing revenue across all property types contributing approximately 1 percentage point to growth. 
Outside the Americas, advisory leasing was less robust, declining by 1% in U.S. dollars but increasing 5% in local currency. Our combined capital markets business comprising property sales and commercial mortgage origination grew by 5% in Q2, up from a slight decline in Q1. 
Americas property sales increased 8%, reflecting market share gains and an increase in commercial real estate transaction volume as investors returned to the market after a tumultuous end to 2018. 
Outside the Americas, property sales declined by 8% or 3% in local currency. The decline was primarily due to our residential business in APAC, where fundamentals remain weak. Excluding residential, commercial property sales revenue outside the Americas actually increased by 8% in local currency against a backdrop of generally soft sales volume. 
Global commercial mortgage origination revenue grew 16% over the prior year and continues to support growth in our loan servicing portfolio. 
Debt markets globally remain very liquid with credit available from a variety of sources including banks, life insurance companies, debt funds, CMBS in both Fanny and Freddie Mac. 
Turning next to our Global Workplace Solutions segment on Slide 6. Momentum for outsourcing offering remains strong and results for the quarter were supported by several large new client engagement. In fact in April, we onboard a 100 million square feet of facilities for several clients in a single day, our largest go-live day in history. 
During the quarter, fee revenue increased 14% despite a 5 percentage point headwind from FX. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by over 30% and our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 180 basis points. Driving the strong performance in GWS with our Americas team which generates approximately 70% of the segments adjusted EBITDA and had an outstanding quarter with nearly 24% fee revenue and nearly 48% adjusted EBITDA growth. 
We expect that demand in GWS will likely be more balanced across our global footprint in the second half of 2019. 
Within GWS, we are further penetrating key sectors like life sciences and retail, the latter of which is being aided by the FacilitySource capabilities we acquired last year. 
We are seeing particular success with clients that utilize multiple GWS services. 
In fact, multiservice clients have represented an increasing percentage of our pipeline for sixth consecutive quarters. 
In Canada, for example, we just won a long-term contract to match all of their facilities in real estate related projects for the province of British Columbia, a portfolio spanning 17 million square feet. Along with Ontario, this is the second Canadian province in our portfolio. 
We were able to [indiscernible] a long-term incumbent service provider and prevail over a field of competitors due to our strong track record in Ontario and the strength of our digital technology tool. 
A key part of the client pursuit win was our digital platform, and our ability to substantially overhaul and upgrade the province's existing facility's technology to drive operating cost savings, improved reporting and enhance business performance for our clients. 
Our margin growth in the quarter was supported by a handful of discrete items such as a decrease in health insurance reserve, which contributed approximately 100 basis points to GWS's margin expansion as well as our efforts to manage operating cost, leverage our scale and increase our selectivity in clients pursuit. 
The GWS business has strong momentum and a record pursuit pipeline, which gives us confidence that double-digit fee revenue growth will continue. 
Turning to our Real Estate Investments segment on Slide 7. This segment's business fundamentals remains solid including progress with our initial investments in Hana, our flexible space offering and our in-process development portfolio, which reached a new record level during the quarter. 
During the quarter, the Real Estate Investments segment saw a $39 million decline in adjusted EBITDA, which was mostly attributable to our development business. 
We had an anticipated this decline given the very strong comparable period and our expectation that the timing of development gains this year will be heavily weighted into the first and fourth quarters. 
This quarter-to-quarter variability in our development business largely goes away when assessing the business over a longer period of time. For example, over the last 5 years, our development business generated nearly $600 million of adjusted EBITDA, while requiring very little capital commitment from CBRE. 
Based on the quality of our development pipeline and are Trammel Crow Company franchise, we expect even stronger financial performance over the next 5 years assuming market conditions remain supportive and no economic downturn occurs. 
During the quarter, Investment Management performance improved from the prior year with adjusted EBITDA up $4 million or 32% in local currency. 
This growth is supported by the increase in our assets under management, which are up $5 billion versus prior year to nearly $107 billion. 
Finally, the launch of Hana, our flexible space solutions business in [indiscernible] cost, which were consistent with our expectations. 
We continue to be pleased with the market response to Hana as our landlord clients are keenly interested in flexible space opportunities and the advising demands from occupiers. 
Further, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our first Hana location, a 67,000 square-foot first-class space at PWC Tower in Dallas. 
Turning to Slide 8, simply put, CBRE is in a solid financial position. Our balance sheet is strong with net leverage of about 0.8 turns of adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2. CBRE remains poised to allocate capital opportunistically with an intense focus on maximizing total shareholder return. 
Taking into account our planned acquisition, we expect that we can invest about $1 billion for the remainder of the year, while maintaining net debt at around 1x trailing adjusted EBITDA. 
In light of our performance in the first half and the trajectory of our business, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year to a range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. The [ 375 ] midpoint reflects a [ $0.15  ] increase from our initial outlook provided in March and a 14% gain over 2018 adjusted earnings per share. 
If achieved, this will be our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. I'd like to note that we do expect adjusted EPS to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter then in 2018 due to the expected timing of development disposition. Specifically, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investment segment to approximate the level attained in the second quarter of this year. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob for his closing remarks."

I guess what we saw happen in the second quarter is that we really believe now it's clear that the decline in the first quarter was a reflection of investors taking a bit of a step back to assess of the market in light of the volatility that they saw in Q4 of '18. 
At this point, we think that given the level of activity in the Americas was strong in Q2, that supports our view that the fundamentals around commercial real estate services remains solidly intact, and so that includes capital allocation real estate and how they continue to rise, debt cost are declining, to your point, and we're also seeing discipline throughout the industry, that includes the underwriting process as well as valuation. So all in all, we think these fundamentals are very supportive of the attractiveness of real estate, particularly on a relative basis to other asset classes. And so from our perspective, we feel pretty good about where we came out in the second quarter from a capital markets perspective in the Americas. And I think it's actually interesting to note, given the fact that we did see that contraction in Q1. Our Advisory segment during the quarter still increased by over 20%. So this shows the diversification that we built into that -- into our basement and particularly our Advisory segment"

But maybe just to give you a little bit more color on GWS, we're seeing an extension not just geographies and lines of business. But as I mentioned earlier, there's a clear expansion of our customer relationships. For now we have about half of our growth coming from those existing clients, and that is allowing us to expand, obviously, the services that we provide. And that is supported by increasing strong NPS scores around customer satisfaction. And I think it also goes to show that we have capabilities that are differentiated, and that we are investing in technology that brings unparalleled service to our customers and that includes FacilitySource, and it also includes capabilities like our Data Center Solutions business. 
So I think those set us apart from operation. It's resulting in record client pursued pipeline that I talked to you before as well as that sixth consecutive quarters of increased multiple service contract as a percent of the pursued pipeline. 
So all in all, we're really pleased with how GWS performed for the quarter, and it's allowing us to become more selective in our pursuit.

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our second quarter results and 2019 outlook in more detail. After these comments, we'll  open up the call for your questions.

Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance, including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings press release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2019.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 11% over the prior year driven by our 2 services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, which together logged 12% fee revenue growth and 18% adjusted EBITDA growth.
Revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based as every line of business within both of these segments increased over the prior year.
In addition, adjusted EBITDA margins on fee revenue increased solidly in both our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments, expanding by 90 basis points on a combined basis. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment declined as expected from the prior year due to the timing of development dispositions and, to a lesser extent, the costs associated with starting up Hana, our flexible space offering. Gains from our development business can vary due to the timing of a project disposition. And last year, we harvested gains from several significant projects during the second quarter. 
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob."
4204816,628781700,1787039,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Brad just noted, we reported another quarter of strong growth for CBRE with double-digit revenue increases in our leasing, Occupier Outsourcing and U.S. capital markets businesses.

As Brad just noted, we reported another quarter of strong growth for CBRE with double-digit revenue increases in our leasing, Occupier Outsourcing and U.S. capital markets businesses. In addition, the impact of our reorganization, which we announced last year, is driving margin improvement in our Advisory Services and Outsourcing businesses. Cost efficiency was one of the key objectives of this change.
The continued strength in our leasing business is notable as lease revenue growth has averaged 20% over the past 5 quarters. While we have benefited from a healthy leasing market, our strong performance also reflects our increasingly differentiated capabilities. This is demonstrated by our success in winning new account-based business because of our ability to integrate Advisory and Transaction solutions in a single offering and to execute at a high level across markets.
During the quarter, U.S. account-based leasing revenue increased 31% from the prior year. Large and sophisticated occupiers are asking CBRE for consultation in workplace design, deep expertise in industry sectors and a full suite of digital capabilities, and they want us to bring it all together with the top brokerage talent in the market.
No firm in our industry is able to match the scale and capabilities of CBRE's leasing business. As a result, when CBRE competes for new account-based leasing mandates, more often than not, we win that business.
Now I'd like to welcome Leah Stearns to her first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. We're extremely excited about the deep financial and operational background she brings to CBRE. Leah has already had a positive impact, and we know she will be a valued contributor to our senior leadership team."
4204816,628781700,1787039,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appear to be stronger than e",1525,"Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appear to be stronger than ever. The evidence of this is clear. Over the last 5 years, CBRE has generated 13% annualized growth in adjusted EBITDA, 18% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and about 70% total shareholder return. This has all been achieved while simultaneously diversifying the business and strengthening the balance sheet.
These financial results have been supported by favorable secular trends, which we believe provide a solid foundation to the earnings our business generates. It's important to recognize that these catalysts show no signs of fatigue.
The owners and occupiers of commercial real estate continue to become larger and they're increasingly sophisticated and they want to work with large sophisticated service providers. Within our sector, CBRE has a powerful competitive position to address this customer demand, and I think that's underappreciated. Our group scale, the breadth of our services we can offer and our ability to invest in digital capabilities are allowing us to pull away from the competition and it's showing up in our financial performance. 
Further, real estate continues to show signs of strength. Institutional capital allocation to real estate continue to rise. Simultaneously, debt [ profs ] are declining while underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios and cap rates all remain largely stable. We see few signs of overbuilding as supply growth is meeting strong occupier demand. Bottom line, given our resilient and diversified business mix and strong balance sheet, CBRE is operating from a position of strength. As a result, we see tremendous opportunities ahead of us. And will remain opportunistic as we deploy capital into our business to maximize total shareholder return in the future.
And with that, let's discuss our financial performance during the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA, which was driven by an 11% increase in fee revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior year period. Margins in the quarter benefited from both business mix and solid cost discipline as operating expenses rose just 2% on an adjusted basis.
As Bob noted, leasing within our advisory business was once again particularly strong, increasing 19%. This was paced by the Americas, which generated 70% of our advisory fee revenue and grew 26%. During the quarter, co-working companies comprised about 3% of our Americas advisory leasing revenue across all property types contributing approximately 1 percentage point to growth. 
Outside the Americas, advisory leasing was less robust, declining by 1% in U.S. dollars but increasing 5% in local currency. 
Our combined capital markets business, comprising property sales and commercial mortgage origination, grew by 5% in Q2, up from a slight decline in Q1. Americas property sales increased 8%, reflecting market share gains and an increase in commercial real estate transaction volumes as investors returned to the market after a tumultuous end to 2018.
Outside the Americas, property sales declined by 8% or 3% in local currency. The decline was primarily due to our residential business in APAC, where fundamentals remained weak. Excluding residential, commercial property sales revenue outside the Americas actually increased by 8% in local currency against a backdrop of generally soft sales volumes.
Global commercial mortgage origination revenue grew 16% over the prior year and continues to support growth in our loan servicing portfolio. Debt markets globally remained very liquid with credit available from a variety of sources including banks, life insurance companies, debt funds, CMBS and both Fannie and Freddie Mac.
Turning next to our Global Workplace Solutions segment on Slide 6. Momentum for our outsourcing offering remained strong and results for the quarter were supported by several large new client engagement. In fact in April, we onboarded 100 million square feet of facilities for several clients in a single day, our largest go-live day in history.
During the quarter, fee revenue increased 14% despite a 5 percentage point headwind from FX.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by over 30% and our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 180 basis points. Driving the strong performance in GWS was our Americas team, which generates approximately 70% of the segments adjusted EBITDA and had an outstanding quarter with nearly 24% fee revenue and nearly 48% adjusted EBITDA growth. We expect that demand in GWS will likely be more balanced across our global footprint in the second half of 2019.
Within GWS, we are further penetrating key sectors like life sciences and retail, the latter of which is being aided by the FacilitySource capabilities we acquired last year. We are seeing particular success with clients that utilize multiple GWS services. In fact, multiservice clients have represented an increasing percentage of our pipeline for sixth consecutive quarter. In Canada, for example, we just won a long-term contract to manage all of their facilities in real estate-related projects for the province of British Columbia, a portfolio spanning 17 million square feet. Along with Ontario, this is the second Canadian province in our portfolio. We were able to unsee a long-term incumbent service provider and prevail over a field of competitors due to our strong track record in Ontario and the strength of our digital technology tool. 
A key part of the client pursuit win was our digital platform and our ability to substantially overhaul and upgrade the province's existing facility's technology to drive operating cost savings, improved reporting and enhanced business performance for our clients.
Our margin growth in the quarter was supported by handful of discrete items, such as a decrease in health insurance reserves, which contributed approximately 100 basis points to GWS's margin expansion as well as our efforts to manage operating costs, leverage our scale and increase our selectivity in client pursuit. The GWS business has strong momentum and a record pursuit pipeline, which gives us confidence that double-digit fee revenue growth will continue.
Turning to our Real Estate Investments segment on Slide 7. This segment's business fundamentals remain solid including progress with our initial investments in Hana, our flexible space offering, and our in-process development portfolio, which reached a new record level during the quarter. 
During the quarter, the Real Estate Investments segment saw a $39 million decline in adjusted EBITDA, which was mostly attributable to our development business. We had anticipated this decline given the very strong comparable period and our expectation that the timing of development gains this year will be heavily weighted into the first and fourth quarters.
This quarter-to-quarter variability in our development business largely goes away when assessing the business over a longer period of time. For example, over the last 5 years, our development business generated nearly $600 million of adjusted EBITDA, while requiring very little capital commitment from CBRE. Based on the quality of our development pipeline and our Trammel Crow Company franchise, we expect even stronger financial performance over the next 5 years assuming market conditions remain supportive and no economic downturn occurs.
During the quarter, Investment Management performance improved from the prior year with adjusted EBITDA up $4 million or 32% in local currency. This growth is supported by the increase in our assets under management, which are up $5 billion versus the prior year to nearly $107 billion.
Finally, the launch of Hana, our flexible space solutions business incurred modest costs, which were consistent with our expectations. We continue to be pleased with the market response to Hana as our landlord clients are keenly interested in flexible space opportunities and the rising demands from occupiers. Further, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our first Hana location, a 67,000 square-foot first-class space at PWC Tower in Dallas.
Turning to Slide 8, simply put, CBRE is in a solid financial position. Our balance sheet is strong with net leverage of about 0.8 turns of adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2. CBRE remains poised to allocate capital opportunistically with an intense focus on maximizing total shareholder return. Taking into account our planned acquisitions, we expect that we can invest about $1 billion for the remainder of the year, while maintaining net debt at around 1x trailing adjusted EBITDA.
In light of our performance in the first half and the trajectory of our business, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year to a range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. The $3.75 midpoint reflects a $0.15 increase from our initial outlook provided in March and a 14% gain over 2018 adjusted earnings per share. If achieved, this would be our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. 
I'd like to note that we do expect adjusted EPS to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter than in 2018 due to the expected timing of development dispositions. Specifically, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment to approximate the level attained in the second quarter of this year. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob for his closing remarks."

Before we conclude, I want to briefly touch on our plans to acquire Telford Homes, which we announced early last month. If approved by Telford's shareholders and government regulators, the Telford transaction will enable us to strategically expand our Trammel Crow Company development business internationally and into a market which is in the early stages of a secular shift toward institutionally owned urban rental housing.

I'll talk to the capital markets piece first. I guess what we saw happen in the second quarter is that we really believe now it's clear that the decline in the first quarter was a reflection of investors taking a bit of a step back to assess the market in light of the volatility that they saw in Q4 of '18. At this point, we think that given the level of activity and the Americas was strong in Q2, that supports our view that the fundamentals around commercial real estate services remain solidly intact, and so that includes capital allocation to real estate and how they continue to rise, debt costs are declining, to your point, and we're also seeing discipline throughout the industry. That includes the underwriting process as well as valuation. So all in all, we think these fundamentals are very supportive of the attractiveness of real estate, particularly on a relative basis to other asset classes. And so from our perspective, we feel pretty good about where we came out in the second quarter from a capital markets perspective in the Americas. And I think it's actually interesting to note, given the fact that we did see that contraction in Q1, our Advisory segment during that quarter still increased by over 20%. So it just shows the diversification that we've built into that -- into our business and particularly our Advisory segment."

And so that's a great opportunity for us to show that we're leveraging the strength between GWS and our transactions team. But maybe just to give you a little bit more color on GWS. We're seeing an expansion of not just geographies and lines of business but, as I mentioned earlier, there's a clear expansion of our customer relationships. And now we have about half of our growth coming from those existing clients, and that is allowing us to expand, obviously, the services that we provide. And that is supported by increasing strong NPS scores around customer satisfaction. I think it also goes to show that we have capabilities that are differentiated, and that we are investing in technology that brings unparalleled service to our customers and that includes FacilitySource, and it also includes capabilities like our Data Center Solutions business. So I think those set us apart from the competition. It's resulting in record client pursuit pipeline that I talked to before as well as that 6 consecutive quarters of increased multiple service contract as a percent of the pursuit pipeline.

Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance, including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.

We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2019.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 11% over the prior year driven by our 2 services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, which together logged 12% fee revenue growth and 18% adjusted EBITDA growth.
Revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based as every line of business within both of these segments increased over the prior year.
In addition, adjusted EBITDA margins on fee revenue increased solidly in both our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments, expanding by 90 basis points on a combined basis. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment declined as expected from the prior year due to the timing of development dispositions and, to a lesser extent, the costs associated with starting up Hana, our flexible space offering. Gains from our development business can vary due to the timing of a project disposition. And last year, we harvested gains from several significant projects during the second quarter. 
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob."
4204816,628781700,1790487,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone.

As Brad just noted, we reported another quarter of strong growth for CBRE with double-digit revenue increases in our leasing, occupier outsourcing and U.S. capital markets businesses. In addition, the impact of our reorganization, which we announced last year, is driving margin improvement in our Advisory Services and Outsourcing businesses. Cost efficiency was one of the key objectives of this change.
The continued strength in our leasing business is notable as lease revenue growth has averaged 20% over the past 5 quarters. While we have benefited from a healthy leasing market, our strong performance also reflects our increasingly differentiated capabilities. This is demonstrated by our success in winning new account-based business because of our ability to integrate Advisory and Transaction solutions in a single offering and to execute at a high level across markets.
During the quarter, U.S. account-based leasing revenue increased 31% from the prior year. Large and sophisticated occupiers are asking CBRE for consultation in workplace design, deep expertise in industry sectors and a full suite of digital capabilities, and they want us to bring it all together with the top brokerage talent in the market.
No firm in our industry is able to match the scale and capabilities of CBRE's leasing business. As a result, when CBRE competes for new account-based leasing mandates, more often than not, we win that business.
Now I'd like to welcome Leah Stearns to her first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. We're extremely excited about the deep financial and operational background she brings to CBRE. Leah has already had a positive impact, and we know she will be a valued contributor to our senior leadership team."
4204816,628781700,1790487,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appear to be stronger than e",1523,"Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appear to be stronger than ever. The evidence of this is clear. Over the last 5 years, CBRE has generated 13% annualized growth in adjusted EBITDA, 18% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and about 70% total shareholder return. This has all been achieved while simultaneously diversifying the business and strengthening the balance sheet.
These financial results have been supported by favorable secular trends, which we believe provide a solid foundation to the earnings our business generates. It's important to recognize that these catalysts show no signs of fatigue.
The owners and occupiers of commercial real estate continue to become larger and they're increasingly sophisticated and they want to work with large sophisticated service providers. Within our sector, CBRE has a powerful competitive position to address this customer demand, and I think that's underappreciated. Our group's scale, the breadth of our services we can offer and our ability to invest in digital capabilities are allowing us to pull away from the competition and it's showing up in our financial performance. 
Further, real estate continues to show signs of strength. Institutional capital allocations to real estate continue to rise. Simultaneously, debt costs are declining while underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios and cap rates all remain largely stable. We see few signs of overbuilding as supply growth is meeting strong occupier demand. Bottom line, given our resilient and diversified business mix and strong balance sheet, CBRE is operating from a position of strength. As a result, we see tremendous opportunities ahead of us. And we'll remain opportunistic as we deploy capital into our business to maximize total shareholder return in the future.
And with that, let's discuss our financial performance during the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA, which was driven by an 11% increase in fee revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior year period. Margins in the quarter benefited from both business mix and solid cost discipline as operating expenses rose just 2% on an adjusted basis.
As Bob noted, leasing within our advisory business was once again particularly strong, increasing 19%. This was paced by the Americas, which generated 70% of our advisory fee revenue and grew 26%. During the quarter, co-working companies comprised about 3% of our Americas advisory leasing revenue across all property types contributing approximately 1 percentage point to growth. 
Outside the Americas, advisory leasing was less robust, declining by 1% in U.S. dollars, but increasing 5% in local currency. 
Our combined capital markets business, comprising property sales and commercial mortgage origination, grew by 5% in Q2, up from a slight decline in Q1. Americas property sales increased 8%, reflecting market share gains and an increase in commercial real estate transaction volumes as investors returned to the market after a tumultuous end to 2018.
Outside the Americas, property sales declined by 8% or 3% in local currency. The decline was primarily due to our residential business in APAC, where fundamentals remained weak. Excluding residential, commercial property sales revenue outside the Americas actually increased by 8% in local currency against a backdrop of generally soft sales volumes.
Global commercial mortgage origination revenue grew 16% over the prior year and continues to support growth in our loan servicing portfolio. Debt markets globally remained very liquid with credit available from a variety of sources including banks, life insurance companies, debt funds, CMBS and both Fannie and Freddie Mac.
Turning next to our Global Workplace Solutions segment on Slide 6. Momentum for our outsourcing offering remained strong and results for the quarter were supported by several large new client engagement. In fact in April, we onboarded 100 million square feet of facilities for several clients in a single day, our largest go-live day in history.
During the quarter, fee revenue increased 14% despite a 5 percentage point headwind from FX.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by over 30% and our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 180 basis points. Driving the strong performance in GWS was our Americas team, which generates approximately 70% of the segment's adjusted EBITDA and had an outstanding quarter with nearly 24% fee revenue and nearly 48% adjusted EBITDA growth. We expect that demand in GWS will likely be more balanced across our global footprint in the second half of 2019.
Within GWS, we are further penetrating key sectors like life sciences and retail, the latter of which is being aided by the FacilitySource capabilities we acquired last year. We are seeing particular success with clients that utilize multiple GWS services. In fact, multiservice clients have represented an increasing percentage of our pipeline for sixth consecutive quarter. In Canada, for example, we just won a long-term contract to manage all of their facilities in real estate-related projects for the province of British Columbia, a portfolio spanning 17 million square feet. Along with Ontario, this is the second Canadian province in our portfolio. We were able to unsee a long-term incumbent service provider and prevail over a field of competitors due to our strong track record in Ontario and the strength of our digital technology tool. 
A key part of the client pursuit win was our digital platform and our ability to substantially overhaul and upgrade the province's existing facility's technology to drive operating cost savings, improved reporting and enhanced business performance for our clients.
Our margin growth in the quarter was supported by handful of discrete items, such as a decrease in health insurance reserves, which contributed approximately 100 basis points to GWS's margin expansion as well as our efforts to manage operating costs, leverage our scale and increase our selectivity in client pursuit. The GWS business has strong momentum and a record pursuit pipeline, which gives us confidence that double-digit fee revenue growth will continue.
Turning to our Real Estate Investments segment on Slide 7. This segment's business fundamentals remain solid, including progress with our initial investments in Hana, our flexible space offering and our in-process development portfolio, which reached a new record level during the quarter. 
During the quarter, the Real Estate Investments segment saw a $39 million decline in adjusted EBITDA, which was mostly attributable to our development business. We had anticipated this decline given the very strong comparable period and our expectation that the timing of development gains this year will be heavily weighted into the first and fourth quarters.
This quarter-to-quarter variability in our development business largely goes away when assessing the business over a longer period of time. For example, over the last 5 years, our development business generated nearly $600 million of adjusted EBITDA, while requiring very little capital commitment from CBRE. Based on the quality of our development pipeline and our Trammel Crow Company franchise, we expect even stronger financial performance over the next 5 years assuming market conditions remain supportive and no economic downturn occurs.
During the quarter, Investment Management performance improved from the prior year with adjusted EBITDA up $4 million or 32% in local currency. This growth is supported by the increase in our assets under management, which are up $5 billion versus the prior year to nearly $107 billion.
Finally, the launch of Hana, our flexible space solutions business, incurred modest costs, which were consistent with our expectations. We continue to be pleased with the market response to Hana as our landlord clients are keenly interested in flexible space opportunities and the rising demands from occupiers. Further, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our first Hana location, a 67,000 square-foot first-class space at PWC Tower in Dallas.
Turning to Slide 8, simply put, CBRE is in a solid financial position. Our balance sheet is strong with net leverage of about 0.8 turns of adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2. CBRE remains poised to allocate capital opportunistically with an intense focus on maximizing total shareholder return. Taking into account our planned acquisitions, we expect that we can invest about $1 billion for the remainder of the year, while maintaining net debt at around 1x trailing adjusted EBITDA.
In light of our performance in the first half and the trajectory of our business, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year to a range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. The $3.75 midpoint reflects a $0.15 increase from our initial outlook provided in March and a 14% gain over 2018 adjusted earnings per share. If achieved, this would be our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. 
I'd like to note that we do expect adjusted EPS to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter than in 2018 due to the expected timing of development dispositions. Specifically, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment to approximate the level attained in the second quarter of this year. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob for his closing remarks."

I'll talk to the capital markets piece first. I guess what we saw happen in the second quarter is that we really believe now it's clear that the decline in the first quarter was a reflection of investors taking a bit of a step back to assess the market in light of the volatility that they saw in Q4 of '18. At this point, we think that given the level of activity and the Americas was strong in Q2, that supports our view that the fundamentals around commercial real estate services remain solidly intact, and so that includes capital allocations to real estate and how they continue to rise; debt costs are declining, to your point; and we're also seeing discipline throughout the industry, that includes the underwriting process as well as valuations. So all in all, we think these fundamentals are very supportive of the attractiveness of real estate, particularly on a relative basis to other asset classes. And so from our perspective, we feel pretty good about where we came out in the second quarter from a capital markets perspective in the Americas. And I think it's actually interesting to note, given the fact that we did see that contraction in Q1, our Advisory segment during that quarter still increased by over 20%. So it just shows the diversification that we've built into that -- into our business and particularly our Advisory segment."

Telford gave us the ability to do something to leverage our Trammell Crow brand beyond the United States, but in an arena where we think there's going to be real secular growth, something different, something better than we've done before. 
Another thing we're looking for when we do acquisitions is businesses that we think, when we bring them on to our platform, we can do more with them than they were able to do themselves and we can do more with them than our competitors can do if they were to buy them. That's what allows us to pay for acquisitions, that's what allows them to be accretive. So that's our model, and it's not geographically biased."

And so that's a great opportunity for us to show that we're leveraging the strength between GWS and our transactions team. But maybe just to give you a little bit more color on GWS. We're seeing an expansion of not just geographies and lines of business but, as I mentioned earlier, there's a clear expansion of our customer relationships. And now we have about half of our growth coming from those existing clients, and that is allowing us to expand, obviously, the services that we provide. And that is supported by increasing strong NPS scores around customer satisfaction. 
I think it also goes to show that we have capabilities that are differentiated, and that we are investing in technology that brings unparalleled service to our customers and that includes FacilitySource, and it also includes capabilities like our Data Center Solutions business. So I think those set us apart from the competition. It's resulting in the record client pursuit pipeline that I talked to before as well as that 6 consecutive quarters of increased multiple service contract as a percent of the pursuit pipeline. 
So all in all, we're really pleased with how GWS performed for the quarter, and it's allowing us to become more selective in our pursuits.

Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance, including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.

We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2019.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 11% over the prior year driven by our 2 services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, which together logged 12% fee revenue growth and 18% adjusted EBITDA growth.
Revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based as every line of business within both of these segments increased over the prior year.
In addition, adjusted EBITDA margins on fee revenue increased solidly in both our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments, expanding by 90 basis points on a combined basis. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment declined as expected from the prior year due to the timing of development dispositions and, to a lesser extent, the costs associated with starting up Hana, our flexible space offering. Gains from our development business can vary due to the timing of a project disposition. And last year, we harvested gains from several significant projects during the second quarter. 
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob."
4204816,628781700,1809459,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Brad just noted, we reported another quarter of strong growth for CBRE with double-digit revenue increases in our leasing, occupier outsourcing and U.S. capital markets businesses.

As Brad just noted, we reported another quarter of strong growth for CBRE with double-digit revenue increases in our leasing, occupier outsourcing and U.S. capital markets businesses. In addition, the impact of our reorganization, which we announced last year, is driving margin improvement in our Advisory Services and Outsourcing businesses. Cost efficiency was one of the key objectives of this change.
The continued strength in our leasing business is notable as lease revenue growth has averaged 20% over the past 5 quarters. While we have benefited from a healthy leasing market, our strong performance also reflects our increasingly differentiated capabilities. This is demonstrated by our success in winning new account-based business because of our ability to integrate Advisory and Transaction solutions in a single offering and to execute at a high level across markets.
During the quarter, U.S. account-based leasing revenue increased 31% from the prior year. Large and sophisticated occupiers are asking CBRE for consultation in workplace design, deep expertise in industry sectors and a full suite of digital capabilities, and they want us to bring it all together with the top brokerage talent in the market.
No firm in our industry is able to match the scale and capabilities of CBRE's leasing business. As a result, when CBRE competes for new account-based leasing mandates, more often than not, we win that business.
Now I'd like to welcome Leah Stearns to her first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. We're extremely excited about the deep financial and operational background she brings to CBRE. Leah has already had a positive impact, and we know she will be a valued contributor to our senior leadership team."
4204816,628781700,1809459,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appear to be stronger than e",1523,"Thank you, Bob. I'm thrilled to join the team at CBRE at such an exciting time in commercial real estate. I can say with confidence that I'm joining a company with incredible momentum and our competitive and financial position appear to be stronger than ever. The evidence of this is clear. Over the last 5 years, CBRE has generated 13% annualized growth in adjusted EBITDA, 18% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and about 70% total shareholder return. This has all been achieved while simultaneously diversifying the business and strengthening the balance sheet.
These financial results have been supported by favorable secular trends, which we believe provide a solid foundation to the earnings our business generates. It's important to recognize that these catalysts show no signs of fatigue.
The owners and occupiers of commercial real estate continue to become larger and they're increasingly sophisticated and they want to work with large sophisticated service providers. Within our sector, CBRE has a powerful competitive position to address this customer demand, and I think that's underappreciated. Our group's scale, the breadth of our services we can offer and our ability to invest in digital capabilities are allowing us to pull away from the competition and it's showing up in our financial performance. 
Further, real estate continues to show signs of strength. Institutional capital allocations to real estate continue to rise. Simultaneously, debt costs are declining while underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios and cap rates all remain largely stable. We see few signs of overbuilding as supply growth is meeting strong occupier demand. Bottom line, given our resilient and diversified business mix and strong balance sheet, CBRE is operating from a position of strength. As a result, we see tremendous opportunities ahead of us. And we'll remain opportunistic as we deploy capital into our business to maximize total shareholder return in the future.
And with that, let's discuss our financial performance during the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA, which was driven by an 11% increase in fee revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior year period. Margins in the quarter benefited from both business mix and solid cost discipline as operating expenses rose just 2% on an adjusted basis.
As Bob noted, leasing within our advisory business was once again particularly strong, increasing 19%. This was paced by the Americas, which generated 70% of our advisory fee revenue and grew 26%. During the quarter, co-working companies comprised about 3% of our Americas advisory leasing revenue across all property types contributing approximately 1 percentage point to growth. 
Outside the Americas, advisory leasing was less robust, declining by 1% in U.S. dollars but increasing 5% in local currency. 
Our combined capital markets business, comprising property sales and commercial mortgage origination, grew by 5% in Q2, up from a slight decline in Q1. Americas property sales increased 8%, reflecting market share gains and an increase in commercial real estate transaction volumes as investors returned to the market after a tumultuous end to 2018.
Outside the Americas, property sales declined by 8% or 3% in local currency. The decline was primarily due to our residential business in APAC, where fundamentals remained weak. Excluding residential, commercial property sales revenue outside the Americas actually increased by 8% in local currency against a backdrop of generally soft sales volumes.
Global commercial mortgage origination revenue grew 16% over the prior year and continues to support growth in our loan servicing portfolio. Debt markets globally remained very liquid with credit available from a variety of sources including banks, life insurance companies, debt funds, CMBS and both Fannie and Freddie Mac.
Turning next to our Global Workplace Solutions segment on Slide 6. Momentum for our outsourcing offering remained strong and results for the quarter were supported by several large new client engagement. In fact in April, we onboarded 100 million square feet of facilities for several clients in a single day, our largest go-live day in history.
During the quarter, fee revenue increased 14% despite a 5 percentage point headwind from FX.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by over 30% and our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 180 basis points. Driving the strong performance in GWS was our Americas team, which generates approximately 70% of the segment's adjusted EBITDA and had an outstanding quarter with nearly 24% fee revenue and nearly 48% adjusted EBITDA growth. We expect that demand in GWS will likely be more balanced across our global footprint in the second half of 2019.
Within GWS, we are further penetrating key sectors like life sciences and retail, the latter of which is being aided by the FacilitySource capabilities we acquired last year. We are seeing particular success with clients that utilize multiple GWS services. In fact, multiservice clients have represented an increasing percentage of our pipeline for sixth consecutive quarter. In Canada, for example, we just won a long-term contract to manage all of their facilities in real estate-related projects for the province of British Columbia, a portfolio spanning 17 million square feet. Along with Ontario, this is the second Canadian province in our portfolio. We were able to unsee a long-term incumbent service provider and prevail over a field of competitors due to our strong track record in Ontario and the strength of our digital technology tool. 
A key part of the client pursuit win was our digital platform and our ability to substantially overhaul and upgrade the province's existing facility's technology to drive operating cost savings, improved reporting and enhanced business performance for our clients.
Our margin growth in the quarter was supported by handful of discrete items, such as a decrease in health insurance reserves, which contributed approximately 100 basis points to GWS's margin expansion as well as our efforts to manage operating costs, leverage our scale and increase our selectivity in client pursuit. The GWS business has strong momentum and a record pursuit pipeline, which gives us confidence that double-digit fee revenue growth will continue.
Turning to our Real Estate Investments segment on Slide 7. This segment's business fundamentals remain solid, including progress with our initial investments in Hana, our flexible space offering and our in-process development portfolio, which reached a new record level during the quarter. 
During the quarter, the Real Estate Investments segment saw a $39 million decline in adjusted EBITDA, which was mostly attributable to our development business. We had anticipated this decline given the very strong comparable period and our expectation that the timing of development gains this year will be heavily weighted into the first and fourth quarters.
This quarter-to-quarter variability in our development business largely goes away when assessing the business over a longer period of time. For example, over the last 5 years, our development business generated nearly $600 million of adjusted EBITDA, while requiring very little capital commitment from CBRE. Based on the quality of our development pipeline and our Trammel Crow Company franchise, we expect even stronger financial performance over the next 5 years assuming market conditions remain supportive and no economic downturn occurs.
During the quarter, Investment Management performance improved from the prior year with adjusted EBITDA up $4 million or 32% in local currency. This growth is supported by the increase in our assets under management, which are up $5 billion versus the prior year to nearly $107 billion.
Finally, the launch of Hana, our flexible space solutions business, incurred modest costs, which were consistent with our expectations. We continue to be pleased with the market response to Hana as our landlord clients are keenly interested in flexible space opportunities and the rising demands from occupiers. Further, we are excited about the upcoming opening of our first Hana location, a 67,000 square-foot first-class space at PWC Tower in Dallas.
Turning to Slide 8, simply put, CBRE is in a solid financial position. Our balance sheet is strong with net leverage of about 0.8 turns of adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2. CBRE remains poised to allocate capital opportunistically with an intense focus on maximizing total shareholder return. Taking into account our planned acquisitions, we expect that we can invest about $1 billion for the remainder of the year, while maintaining net debt at around 1x trailing adjusted EBITDA.
In light of our performance in the first half and the trajectory of our business, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year to a range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. The $3.75 midpoint reflects a $0.15 increase from our initial outlook provided in March and a 14% gain over 2018 adjusted earnings per share. If achieved, this would be our 10th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. 
I'd like to note that we do expect adjusted EPS to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter than in 2018 due to the expected timing of development dispositions. Specifically, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment to approximate the level attained in the second quarter of this year. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob for his closing remarks."

As you can see from our revised earnings outlook, we are in a strong strategic position with excellent momentum in our business, particularly in the Americas, where we generate the majority of our revenue in earnings. As important, CBRE is well positioned, thanks to our ongoing investments in people, integrated solutions and technology and our recent reorganization to drive both great client outcomes and continued strong growth.
Before we conclude, I want to briefly touch on our plans to acquire Telford Homes, which we announced early last month. If approved by Telford's shareholders and government regulators, the Telford transaction will enable us to strategically expand our Trammel Crow Company development business internationally and into a market which is in the early stages of a secular shift toward institutionally owned urban rental housing. Telford's shareholders will vote on our buyout offer on August 6.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

I guess what we saw happen in the second quarter is that we really believe now it's clear that the decline in the first quarter was a reflection of investors taking a bit of a step back to assess the market in light of the volatility that they saw in Q4 of '18. At this point, we think that given the level of activity and the Americas was strong in Q2, that supports our view that the fundamentals around commercial real estate services remain solidly intact, and so that includes capital allocations to real estate and how they continue to rise; debt costs are declining, to your point; and we're also seeing discipline throughout the industry, that includes the underwriting process as well as valuations. So all in all, we think these fundamentals are very supportive of the attractiveness of real estate, particularly on a relative basis to other asset classes. And so from our perspective, we feel pretty good about where we came out in the second quarter from a capital markets perspective in the Americas. And I think it's actually interesting to note, given the fact that we did see that contraction in Q1, our Advisory segment during that quarter still increased by over 20%. So it just shows the diversification that we've built into that -- into our business and particularly our Advisory segment."

Telford gave us the ability to do something to leverage our Trammell Crow brand beyond the United States, but in an arena where we think there's going to be real secular growth, something different, something better than we've done before. 
Another thing we're looking for when we do acquisitions is businesses that we think, when we bring them on to our platform, we can do more with them than they were able to do themselves and we can do more with them than our competitors can do if they were to buy them.

And so that's a great opportunity for us to show that we're leveraging the strength between GWS and our transactions team. But maybe just to give you a little bit more color on GWS. We're seeing an expansion of not just geographies and lines of business but, as I mentioned earlier, there's a clear expansion of our customer relationships. And now we have about half of our growth coming from those existing clients, and that is allowing us to expand, obviously, the services that we provide. And that is supported by increasing strong NPS scores around customer satisfaction. 
I think it also goes to show that we have capabilities that are differentiated, and that we are investing in technology that brings unparalleled service to our customers and that includes FacilitySource, and it also includes capabilities like our Data Center Solutions business. So I think those set us apart from the competition. It's resulting in the record client pursuit pipeline that I talked to before as well as that 6 consecutive quarters of increased multiple service contract as a percent of the pursuit pipeline. 
So all in all, we're really pleased with how GWS performed for the quarter, and it's allowing us to become more selective in our pursuits.

Our agenda for today's morning call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. 
After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance, including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risk and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings press release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. 
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was flat at $0.79. Strong top and bottom line growth within our two services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, was offset by a decline in adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment. 
The $85 million of adjusted EBITDA realized at real estate investments in last year's third quarter represented an all-time record for the segment. 
On a combined basis, our two services segments generated fee revenue growth in adjusted EBITDA growth of over 11% and 16%, respectively. 
In addition, the combined adjusted EBITDA margin for our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments expanded approximately 70 basis points. Finally, our consolidated results also reflect negative foreign exchange translation impacts of 2% and 1% to fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, respectively. 
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob."

As you've seen, we reported another strong quarter in our services business, driven by double-digit revenue growth in global Occupier Outsourcing, U.S. advisory property sales and commercial mortgage origination. We continue to benefit from strong organic growth in operating leverage in our combined services businesses. 
Additionally, in early October, we completed the acquisition of Telford Homes, expanding our development capabilities into the U.K. where the multifamily rental market is poised for long-term secular growth. 
We were [indiscernible] to acquire Telford as an attractive valuation, reflecting market concerns due to Brexit without materially altering our capital structure or engaging in a lengthy integration process. 
We believe the very successful Telford team will be able to accomplish more on CBRE's platform than they could on their own. Strategic M&A is core to our strategy, and Telford represents the type of acquisition you should expect from CBRE. Sourcing, underwriting and integrating acquisitions is a competitive advantage for our company. 
Both our M&A and our senior business leadership teams are deeply experienced at targeting underwriting closing and integrating acquisition opportunities. Since 2014, we have deployed nearly $2.6 billion for acquisitions that have bolstered our growth, our ability to serve our clients and our strategic position in the marketplace. 
Leah will discuss our approach to M&A and capital allocation after she reviews the quarter in more detail. Leah?"

Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 8% fee revenue growth during the quarter.

Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 8% fee revenue growth during the quarter. Strong operating leverage drove margin expansion of about 140 basis points and 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA. 
Over half of the margin expansion resulted from commercial mortgage origination gains. The remainder is attributable to well disciplined operating expense management against a healthy revenue growth. We saw double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in local currency from both our Americas and non-Americas region. 
Our North Asia division saw the strongest adjusted EBITDA growth of any geographical region in the quarter as outstanding capital markets activity in Japan more than offset soft market conditions in Hong Kong and China. These two markets make up our Greater China region and represent less than approximately 1% of CBRE's total adjusted EBITDA. 
Global capital markets, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage origination set the pace for revenue growth, accelerating to 11%, up significantly from 1% in the first half of the year. This acceleration was led by our commercial mortgage origination revenue growth of nearly 24%, which was fueled by an increasing number of larger transactions and market share gains with private entities including life insurers, conduit and credit funds. 
Property sales revenue growth was led by the United States, which increased by 19% on meaningful market share gains. This is primarily driven by a sizable number of larger transactions and notable strength in the Northeast region of the United States. Outside the Americas, property sales declined 6%, which includes a negative FX impact of 3% and continued weakness in residential sales in the Pacific region and parts of Asia. Excluding Asia Pacific residential, property sales growth outside the Americas was flat in local currency. Capital markets activity, particularly in the Americas, continue to be bolstered by the ample supply of capital, focused on investing in commercial real estate, strong occupancy rates and measured supply growth. 
Advisory leasing revenue growth was 4% or 5% in local currency terms, a healthy increase against 17% growth in the prior year's quarter. 
U.S. leasing revenue grew by 4% and was driven by clients in technology, financial services and manufacturing sectors, which accounted for nearly 60% of U.S. leasing revenue. We also saw a notable acceleration in account-based deals in the quarter. Inclusive of activity now recorded in our Global Workplace Solutions segment, Americas leasing revenue rose 7% for the quarter. Leasing with co- working companies drove less than 4% of our trailing 12-month leasing revenue in the U.S. and less than 3% of U.S. leasing revenue in the third quarter. These figures include both negotiating leases for co-working companies as a tenant [indiscernible] for landlord agents and placing occupiers in co-working space. 
The demand for co-working remains a relatively small component of the overall U.S. market with no single operator representing more than one half of 1% of the total. While flexible office space solutions will continue to grow, this factor is not large enough to swing overall commercial real estate market fundamentals in any meaningful way. 
Turning to our Global Workplace Solutions segment, on Slide 6, we produced [ 15 ]% adjusted EBITDA growth with the strength across our 3 lines of business, facilities management, project management and our transactions. Importantly, our customer base also continued to be composed of large high-quality company with approximately 85% of our GWS revenue generated from investment grade rated clients. Fee revenue growth of 21% reflects continued strong momentum for our Occupier Outsourcing services, boosted by landing large new enterprise client engagement and expanding existing relationships. 
In addition, fee revenue growth outpaced total revenue growth due to a greater weighting of fixed price contracts. Likely negative operating leverage reflected a couple of challenging accounts in Europe, which we expect to remediate next year and a handful of choppier expense items and noncash accounting adjustments, which totaled $12 million in the quarter. 
Our business has a distinct competitive advantage in procuring large, integrated global accounts. One recent example is Novartis, which has appointed us to provide facilities, Project Management and transaction and advisory services on worldwide basis. The [ $70 ] million square foot portfolio represents one of our largest ever new contracts for our Global Workplace Solutions team. 
Our pipeline for the outsourcing business remains robust, and we're seeing more clients contracting for a bigger bundle of services. On a year-to-date basis, nearly 40% of the adjusted EBITDA associated with new contracts was derived from customers purchasing the full suite of services offered by our outsourcing business, which is up significantly both sequentially and from the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 7, and our Real Estate Investments segment. Adjusted EBITDA [indiscernible] by over $70 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the timing of development transaction. Beyond development, strong growth in the investment management business offset our incremental investment in our new flexible office space business, Hana. Development adjusted EBITDA was slightly below our expectations for the third quarter as a couple of smaller deals are now expected to transact in 2020. 
We also now expect one larger $20 million adjusted EBITDA deal, previously anticipated in the fourth quarter to transact in 2020. Our development business' financial performance has natural variability from quarter-to-quarter. The market overall remains very healthy and are combined in process and pipeline portfolio reached a record level, rising $1.3 billion, sequentially. Investor enthusiasm for development projects remains high and cap rates for our Class A projects remained tight. While our timing expectations have shifted for a few specific developments, our pricing expectations have not changed. 
Performance in our investment management business continued to improve, contributing just over $20 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Assets Under Management would have reached a new record level, but for a $1.7 billion headwind from foreign currency translation. 
Capital raising also remains elevated with more than $12 billion raised over the past 12 months. Finally, our new co-working concept, Hana, opened its first location in Dallas in the quarter with units planned in Southern California and London by early next year. We believe demand for flexible workspace is here to stay and landlords and occupiers are increasingly gravitating to high-quality operators with strong financial sponsorship. 
Our pipeline for future high locations focuses on major CBD and includes a variety of structures including management, partnership agreement as well as leases. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are very focused on pursuing a disciplined approach to allocating capital as CBRE. Over the last 5 years, we have strengthened our balance sheet, which is evidenced by a reduction in net leverage and are more than $3 billion of liquidity. The capital structure provides us a solid foundation to execute our capital allocation strategy. Our priorities for capital allocation are focused on investing in growth through tech enablement CapEx, accretive M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders. 
Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $770 million of capital, including our recent Telford acquisition and share repurchases in October. 
We have also invested over $142 million on capital expenditures net of concession, with well over half of this deployed for technology focused investment, that enable our professionals to bring higher level of service to our clients with greater efficiency. In addition, as of today, CBRE has repurchased over $145 million of shares in 2019, including our recently initiated TenB51 program, which executed the repurchase of $100 million at an average price of [ $51.64 ] since the beginning of third quarter. Given our current and forecasted levels of leverage as well as a significant financial capacity, you can expect to realize share repurchases in a more programmatic way to both maintain flexible to their own capital allocation and to provide a more consistent approach to returning capital to shareholders. 
Finally, with respect to our expectations for our full year 2019 outlook, due to the delay timing of development deals, we now expect adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment at or slightly below the low end of the $200 million to $220 million range we set in March inclusive of a modest benefit from Telford in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, we are maintaining our guidance range of $3.70 to $3.80 for full year adjusted EPS. As we expect strength in our services businesses to offset the impact of these delays development deal. This implies 14% growth at the midpoint of our guidance range for 2019. 
Turning to Slide 9, I'll turn the call back to Bob for his brief closing remarks."

So Ryan, I would say that what's happened with we work has had an impact on our Hana strategy that I would characterize as tactical, but it is not had an impact on the overall strategy. So in the short run, we're seeing some incremental inquiries from occupiers of Hana. We're seeing some incremental inquiries from landlords that are considering going in our direction that maybe weren't before, but in the long run as Leah said, we see this co-working or flexible space market opportunity the way we saw before it's roughly 2% of the multi-tenant space around the world today. We continue to think it will go to as much as 10%. Our belief in that direction is driven by the work we've done with our occupiers around the world. We know that they expect a percentage of their occupancy in the future to be in this type of space and we think that's good. Our strategy for Hana is to start to carefully build a footprint with a bit more capital intensive model, i.e., more investment, more leases in overtime likely moved to a model where we manage space, co-working space that's owned by the landlords themselves. Our hypothesis is that over time, landlords are going to want a co-working space in their buildings because they believe the tenants are going to want, and they're likely going to want to control because they want to control the tendency. They view themselves as owning a lot of the downside so they want to own the upside, and we are positioning Hana to move in that direction if that's the direction the market moves. Nothing about our results with high and the short run have been impacted in any meaningful way relative to what we thought they would be."

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance, including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.

We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was flat at $0.79. Strong top and bottom line growth within our 2 services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, was offset by a decline in adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment. 
The $85 million of adjusted EBITDA realized at Real Estate Investments in last year's third quarter represented an all-time record for the segment.
On a combined basis, our 2 services segments generated fee revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of over 11% and 16%, respectively. 
In addition, the combined adjusted EBITDA margin for our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments expanded approximately 70 basis points. Finally, our consolidated results also reflect negative foreign exchange translation impacts of 2% and 1% to fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, respectively. 
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob."

As you've seen, we reported another strong quarter in our services business, driven by double-digit revenue growth in global Occupier Outsourcing, U.S. advisory property sales and commercial mortgage origination. We continue to benefit from strong organic growth and operating leverage in our combined services businesses. 
Additionally, in early October, we completed the acquisition of Telford Homes, expanding our development capabilities into the U.K. where the multifamily rental market is poised for long-term secular growth.
We were elbowed to acquire Telford as an attractive valuation, reflecting market concerns due to Brexit without materially altering our capital structure or engaging in a lengthy integration process.
We believe the very successful Telford team will be able to accomplish more on CBRE's platform than they could on their own. 
Strategic M&A is core to our strategy, and Telford represents the type of acquisition you should expect from CBRE. Sourcing, underwriting and integrating acquisitions is a competitive advantage for our company.
Both our M&A and our senior business leadership teams are deeply experienced at targeting underwriting closing and integrating acquisition opportunities. Since 2014, we have deployed nearly $2.6 billion for acquisitions that have bolstered our growth, our ability to serve our clients and our strategic position in the marketplace.
Leah will discuss our approach to M&A and capital allocation after she reviews the quarter in more detail. Leah?"

Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 8% fee revenue growth during the quarter. Strong operating leverage drove margin expansion of about 140 basis points and 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA.Over half the margin expansio",1400,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 8% fee revenue growth during the quarter. Strong operating leverage drove margin expansion of about 140 basis points and 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Over half the margin expansion resulted from commercial mortgage origination gain. The remainder is attributable to well-disciplined operating expense management against a healthy revenue growth. We saw a double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in local currency from both our Americas and non-Americas region.
Our North Asia division saw the strongest adjusted EBITDA growth of any geographical region in the quarter as outstanding capital markets activity in Japan more than offset soft market conditions in Hong Kong and China. These 2 markets make up our Greater China region and represent less than approximately 1% of CBRE's total adjusted EBITDA.
Global capital markets, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage origination set the pace for revenue growth, accelerating to 11%, up significantly from 1% in the first half of the year. This acceleration was led by our commercial mortgage origination revenue growth of nearly 24%, which was fueled by an increasing number of larger transactions and market share gain with private entities including life insurers, conduit and credit funds.
Property sales revenue growth was led by the United States, which increased by 19% on meaningful market share gains. This is primarily driven by a sizable number of larger transactions and notable strength in the Northeast region of the United States. 
Outside the Americas, property sales declined 6%, which includes a negative FX impact of 3% and continued weakness in residential sales in the Pacific region and parts of Asia. Excluding Asia Pacific residential, property sales growth outside the Americas was flat in local currency. Capital markets activity, particularly in the Americas, continued to be bolstered by the ample supply of capital, focused on investing in commercial real estate, strong occupancy rates and measured supply growth.
Advisory leasing revenue growth rose 4% or 5% in local currency terms, a healthy increase against 17% growth in the prior year's quarter. 
U.S. leasing revenue grew by 4% and was driven by clients in technology, financial services and manufacturing sectors, which accounted for nearly 60% of U.S. leasing revenue. We also saw a notable acceleration in account-based deals in the quarter. Inclusive of activity now recorded in our Global Workplace Solutions segment, Americas leasing revenue rose 7% for the quarter. 
Leasing with co-working companies drove less than 4% of our trailing 12-month leasing revenue in the U.S. and less than 3% of U.S. leasing revenue in the third quarter. These figures include both negotiating leases for co-working companies as tenant rep or landlord agent and placing occupiers in co-working space.
The demand for co-working remains a relatively small component of the overall U.S. market with no single operator representing more than one half of 1% of the total. While flexible office space solutions will continue to grow, this factor is not large enough to swing overall commercial real estate market fundamentals in any meaningful way.
Turning to our Global Workplace Solutions segment, on Slide 6, we produced 15% adjusted EBITDA growth with the strength across our 3 lines of business: facilities management; project management; and our transactions. Importantly, our customer base also continued to be composed of large high-quality companies with approximately 85% of our GWS revenue generated from investment grade rated clients. Fee revenue growth of 21% reflects continued strong momentum for our Occupier Outsourcing services, boosted by landing large new enterprise client engagement and expanding existing relationships. In addition, fee revenue growth outpaced total revenue growth due to a greater weighting of fixed-price contracts. 
Slightly negative operating leverage reflected a couple of challenging accounts in Europe, which we expect to remediate next year and a handful of choppier expense items and noncash accounting adjustments, which totaled $12 million in the quarter. 
Our business has a distinct competitive advantage in procuring large, integrated global accounts. One recent example is Novartis, which has appointed us to provide facilities, Project Management and transaction and advisory services on worldwide basis. The 70 million square foot portfolio represents one of our largest ever new contracts for our Global Workplace Solutions team.
Our pipeline for the outsourcing business remains robust, and we're seeing more clients contracting for a bigger bundle of services. On a year-to-date basis, nearly 40% of the adjusted EBITDA associated with new contracts was derived from customers purchasing the full suite of services offered by our outsourcing business, which is up significantly both sequentially and from the prior year period.
Turning to Slide 7, and our Real Estate Investments segment. Adjusted EBITDA fell by over $70 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the timing of development transaction. Beyond development, strong growth in our Investment Management business offset our incremental investment in our new flexible office space business, Hana. Development adjusted EBITDA was slightly below our expectations for the third quarter as a couple of smaller deals are now expected to transact in 2020. 
We also now expect one larger $20 million adjusted EBITDA deal, previously anticipated in the fourth quarter to transact in 2020. Our development business' financial performance has natural variability from quarter-to-quarter. The market overall remains very healthy and our combined in-process and pipeline portfolio reached a record level, rising $1.3 billion, sequentially. 
Investor enthusiasm for development projects remains high and cap rates for our Class A projects remained tight. While our timing expectations have shifted for a few specific developments, our pricing expectations have not changed. 
Performance in our investment management business continued to improve, contributing just over $20 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. 
Assets Under Management would have reached a new record level, but for a $1.7 billion headwind from foreign currency translation. 
Capital raising also remains elevated with more than $12 billion raised over the past 12 months. Finally, our new co-working concept, Hana, opened its first location in Dallas in the quarter with units planned in Southern California and London by early next year. We believe demand for flexible workspace is here to stay and landlords and occupiers are increasingly gravitating to high-quality operators with strong financial sponsorship. 
Our pipeline for future Hana locations focuses on major CBDs and includes a variety of structures including management, partnership agreements as well as leases. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are very focused on pursuing a disciplined approach to allocating capital at CBRE. Over the last 5 years, we have strengthened our balance sheet, which is evidenced by a reduction in net leverage and are more than $3 billion of liquidity. This capital structure provides us a solid foundation to execute our capital allocation strategy. Our priorities for capital allocation are focused on investing in growth through tech-enablement CapEx, accretive M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $770 million of capital, including our recent Telford acquisition and share repurchases in October.
We have also invested over $142 million on capital expenditures, net of concession, with well over half of this deployed for technology-focused investments, that enable our professionals to bring higher level of service to our clients with greater efficiency. 
In addition, as of today, CBRE has repurchased over $145 million of shares in 2019, including our recently initiated 10B5-1 program, which executed the repurchase of $100 million at an average price of $51.64 since the beginning of third quarter. Given our current and forecasted levels of leverage as well as our significant financial capacity, you can expect us to utilize share repurchases in a more programmatic way to both maintain flexibility around capital allocation and to provide a more consistent approach to returning capital to shareholders. 
Finally, with respect to our expectations for our full year 2019 outlook, due to the delayed timing of development deals, we now expect adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment at or slightly below the low end of the $200 million to $220 million range we set in March, inclusive of a modest benefit from Telford in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, we are maintaining our guidance range of $3.70 to $3.80 for full year adjusted EPS, as we expect strengthen our services businesses to offset the impact of these delayed development deal. This implies 14% growth as the midpoint of our guidance range for 2019.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll turn the call back to Bob for his brief closing remarks."

So Ryan, I would say that what's happened with WeWork has had an impact on our Hana strategy that I would characterize as tactical, but it has not had an impact on the overall strategy. So in the short run, we're seeing some incremental inquiries from occupiers of Hana. We're seeing some incremental inquiries from landlords that are considering going in our direction that maybe weren't before, but in the long run, as Leah said, we see this co-working or flexible space market opportunity the way we saw it before, it's roughly 2% of the multi-tenant space around the world today. We continue to think it will go to as much as 10%. Our belief in that direction is driven by the work we've done with our occupiers around the world. We know that they expect a percentage of their occupancy in the future to be in this type of space and we think that's good. Our strategy for Hana is to start to carefully build a footprint with a bit more capital intensive model, i.e., more investment, more leases in over time likely move to a model where we manage space, co-working space, that's owned by the landlords themselves. Our hypothesis is that over time, landlords are going to want a co-working space in their buildings because they believe their tenants are going to want, they're likely going to want to control it, because they want to control the tendency. They view themselves as owning a lot of the downside so they want to own the upside, and we are positioning Hana to move in that direction if that's the direction the market moves. Nothing about our results with Hana in the short run have been impacted in any meaningful way relative to what we thought they would be."

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance, including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.

We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was flat at $0.79. Strong top and bottom line growth within our 2 services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, was offset by a decline in adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment. 
The $85 million of adjusted EBITDA realized at Real Estate Investments in last year's third quarter represented an all-time record for the segment.
On a combined basis, our 2 services segments generated fee revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of over 11% and 16%, respectively. 
In addition, the combined adjusted EBITDA margin for our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments expanded approximately 70 basis points. Finally, our consolidated results also reflect negative foreign exchange translation impacts of 2% and 1% to fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, respectively. 
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob."

As you've seen, we reported another strong quarter in our services business, driven by double-digit revenue growth in global Occupier Outsourcing, U.S. advisory property sales and commercial mortgage origination. We continue to benefit from strong organic growth and operating leverage in our combined services businesses. 
Additionally, in early October, we completed the acquisition of Telford Homes, expanding our development capabilities into the U.K. where the multifamily rental market is poised for long-term secular growth.
We were able to acquire Telford as an attractive valuation, reflecting market concerns due to Brexit without materially altering our capital structure or engaging in a lengthy integration process.
We believe the very successful Telford team will be able to accomplish more on CBRE's platform than they could on their own. 
Strategic M&A is core to our strategy, and Telford represents the type of acquisition you should expect from CBRE. Sourcing, underwriting and integrating acquisitions is a competitive advantage for our company.
Both our M&A and our senior business leadership teams are deeply experienced at targeting, underwriting, closing and integrating acquisition opportunities. Since 2014, we have deployed nearly $2.6 billion for acquisitions that have bolstered our growth, our ability to serve our clients and our strategic position in the marketplace.
Leah will discuss our approach to M&A and capital allocation after she reviews the quarter in more detail. Leah?"

Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 8% fee revenue growth during the quarter. Strong operating leverage drove margin expansion of about 140 basis points and 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA.Over half the margin expansio",1397,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 8% fee revenue growth during the quarter. Strong operating leverage drove margin expansion of about 140 basis points and 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Over half the margin expansion resulted from commercial mortgage origination gains. The remainder is attributable to well-disciplined operating expense management against a healthy revenue growth. We saw double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in local currency from both our Americas and non-Americas region.
Our North Asia division saw the strongest adjusted EBITDA growth of any geographical region in the quarter as outstanding capital markets activity in Japan more than offset soft market conditions in Hong Kong and China. These 2 markets make up our Greater China region and represent less than approximately 1% of CBRE's total adjusted EBITDA.
Global capital markets, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage originations set the pace for revenue growth, accelerating to 11%, up significantly from 1% in the first half of the year. This acceleration was led by our commercial mortgage origination revenue growth of nearly 24%, which was fueled by an increasing number of larger transactions and market share gain with private entities including life insurers, conduits and credit funds.
Property sales revenue growth was led by the United States, which increased by 19% on meaningful market share gains. This is primarily driven by a sizable number of larger transactions and notable strength in the Northeast region of the United States. 
Outside the Americas, property sales declined 6%, which includes a negative FX impact of 3% and continued weakness in residential sales in the Pacific region and parts of Asia. Excluding Asia Pacific residential, property sales growth outside the Americas was flat in local currency. Capital markets activity, particularly in the Americas, continued to be bolstered by the ample supply of capital, focused on investing in commercial real estate, strong occupancy rates and measured supply growth.
Advisory leasing revenue growth rose 4% or 5% in local currency terms, a healthy increase against 17% growth in the prior year's quarter. 
U.S. leasing revenue grew by 4% and was driven by clients in technology, financial services and manufacturing sectors, which accounted for nearly 60% of U.S. leasing revenue. We also saw a notable acceleration in account-based deals in the quarter. Inclusive of activity now recorded in our Global Workplace Solutions segment, Americas leasing revenue rose 7% for the quarter. 
Leasing with co-working companies drove less than 4% of our trailing 12-month leasing revenue in the U.S. and less than 3% of U.S. leasing revenue in the third quarter. These figures include both negotiating leases for co-working companies as tenant rep or landlord agent and placing occupiers in co-working space.
The demand for co-working remains a relatively small component of the overall U.S. market with no single operator representing more than 0.5% of the total. While flexible office space solutions will continue to grow, this sector is not large enough to swing overall commercial real estate market fundamentals in any meaningful way.
Turning to our Global Workplace Solutions segment, on Slide 6, we produced 15% adjusted EBITDA growth with the strength across our 3 lines of business: facilities management; project management; and our transactions. Importantly, our customer base also continued to be composed of large high-quality companies with approximately 85% of our GWS revenue generated from investment grade rated clients. 
Fee revenue growth of 21% reflects continued strong momentum for our Occupier Outsourcing services, boosted by landing large new enterprise client engagement and expanding existing relationships. In addition, fee revenue growth outpaced total revenue growth due to a greater weighting of fixed-price contracts. 
Slightly negative operating leverage reflected a couple of challenging accounts in Europe, which we expect to remediate next year and a handful of choppier expense items and noncash accounting adjustments, which totaled $12 million in the quarter. 
Our business has the distinct competitive advantage in securing large, integrated global accounts. One recent example is Novartis, which has appointed us to provide facilities, Project Management and transaction and advisory services on worldwide basis. The 70 million square foot portfolio represents one of our largest ever new contracts for our Global Workplace Solutions team.
Our pipeline for the outsourcing business remains robust, and we're seeing more clients contracting for a bigger bundle of services. On a year-to-date basis, nearly 40% of the adjusted EBITDA associated with new contracts was derived from customers purchasing the full suite of services offered by our outsourcing business, which is up significantly both sequentially and from the prior year period.
Turning to Slide 7, and our Real Estate Investments segment. Adjusted EBITDA fell by over $70 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the timing of development transactions. Beyond development, strong growth in our Investment Management business offset our incremental investment in our new flexible office space business, Hana. Development adjusted EBITDA was slightly below our expectations for the third quarter as a couple of smaller deals are now expected to transact in 2020. 
We also now expect one larger $20 million adjusted EBITDA deal, previously anticipated in the fourth quarter to transact in 2020. Our development business' financial performance has natural variability from quarter-to-quarter. The market overall remains very healthy and our combined in-process and pipeline portfolio reached a record level, rising $1.3 billion, sequentially. 
Investor enthusiasm for development projects remains high and cap rates for our Class A projects remained tight. While our timing expectations have shifted for a few specific developments, our pricing expectations have not changed. 
Performance in our investment management business continued to improve, contributing just over $20 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. 
Assets Under Management would have reached a new record level, but for a $1.7 billion headwind from foreign currency translation. Capital raising also remains elevated with more than $12 billion raised over the past 12 months. 
Finally, our new co-working concept, Hana, opened its first location in Dallas in the quarter with units planned in Southern California and London by early next year. We believe demand for flexible workspace is here to stay and landlords and occupiers are increasingly gravitating to high-quality operators with strong financial sponsorship. 
Our pipeline for future Hana locations focuses on major CBDs and includes a variety of structures including management, partnership agreements as well as leases. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are very focused on pursuing a disciplined approach to allocating capital at CBRE. Over the last 5 years, we have strengthened our balance sheet, which is evidenced by our reduction in net leverage and our more than $3 billion of liquidity. This capital structure provides us a solid foundation to execute our capital allocation strategy. Our priorities for capital allocation are focused on investing in growth through tech-enablement CapEx, accretive M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $770 million of capital, including our recent Telford acquisition and share repurchases in October.
We have also invested over $142 million on capital expenditures, net of concession, with well over half of this deployed for technology-focused investments, that enable our professionals to bring higher levels of service to our clients with greater efficiency. 
In addition, as of today, CBRE has repurchased over $145 million of shares in 2019, including our recently initiated 10B5-1 program, which executed the repurchase of $100 million at an average price of $51.64 since the beginning of third quarter. 
Given our current and forecasted levels of leverage as well as our significant financial capacity, you can expect us to utilize share repurchases in a more programmatic way to both maintain flexibility around capital allocation and to provide a more consistent approach to returning capital to shareholders. 
Finally, with respect to our expectations for our full year 2019 outlook, due to the delayed timing of development deals, we now expect adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment at or slightly below the low end of the $200 million to $220 million range we set in March, inclusive of a modest benefit from Telford in the fourth quarter. 
Nonetheless, we are maintaining our guidance range of $3.70 to $3.80 for full year adjusted EPS, as we expect strength in our services businesses to offset the impact of these delayed development deals. This implies 14% growth as the midpoint of our guidance range for 2019.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll turn the call back to Bob for his brief closing remarks."

So Ryan, I would say that what's happened with WeWork has had an impact on our Hana strategy that I would characterize as tactical, but it has not had an impact on the overall strategy. So in the short run, we're seeing some incremental inquiries from occupiers of Hana. We're seeing some incremental inquiries from landlords that are considering going in our direction that maybe weren't before. 
But in the long run, as Leah said, we see this co-working or flexible space market opportunity the way we saw it before, it's roughly 2% of the multi-tenant space around the world today. We continue to think it will go to as much as 10%. 
Our belief in that direction is driven by the work we've done with our occupiers around the world. We know that they expect a percentage of their occupancy in the future to be in this type of space and we think that's good. Our strategy for Hana is to start to carefully build a footprint with a bit more capital intensive model, i.e., more investment, more leases, and, over time, likely move to a model where we manage space, co-working space, that's owned by the landlords themselves. Our hypothesis is that over time, landlords are going to want a co-working space in their buildings because they believe their tenants are going to want it. They're likely going to want to control it, because they want to control the tenancy. They view themselves as owning a lot of the downside so they want to own the upside, and we are positioning Hana to move in that direction if that's the direction the market moves. 
Nothing about our results with Hana in the short run have been impacted in any meaningful way relative to what we thought they would be."

And again, I can't stress enough, we are in the door working for a high percentage of the big occupiers around the world doing all kinds of flexible space work for them inside their spaces. We know what they want. 
We know they want a portion of their portfolio in this flex space format. If you look at what went on with occupiers historically, they basically said we're going to own some of our space, we're going to lease some of our space on a traditional basis and we'll -- on the very margin, we'll do a little bit of co-working. Well, that's changed. There is -- they think that co-working is going to be a material piece of their portfolio of occupancy going forward, and we've oriented our Hana concept to be consistent with that."

Chandra Dhandapani and her team came in and they've gotten that done. They've turned their attention along with our market-facing business leaders to what we call enablement technology, tools that our professionals use to secure business and deliver business to our clients. 
There is a large suite of tools spread across all our lines of businesses that they are working on. We have very specific adoption metrics for all the key tools we're using, and we're tracking adoption against those metrics. In many, many cases, we're satisfied with adoption in other cases we're trying to push adoption up. But there is a ton of focus on that in our business and there will continue to be a ton of focus on that. 
We don't talk externally about what those specific metrics are, et cetera. We consider that to be proprietary, but that's where our focus is now. We're shifting more and more of our spend to enablement tools and you should expect that trend to continue and we're in the budgeting process now, going through all kinds of efforts, jointly between our D&T team and our field people to figure out exactly which tools we're going to invest in, in 2020.

After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment, acquisition, integration and financial performance, including our 2019 outlook, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.

We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.
Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was flat at $0.79. Strong top and bottom line growth within our 2 services segments, Advisory Services and Global Workplace Solutions, was offset by a decline in adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment. 
The $85 million of adjusted EBITDA realized at Real Estate Investments in last year's third quarter represented an all-time record for the segment.
On a combined basis, our 2 services segments generated fee revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of over 11% and 16%, respectively. 
In addition, the combined adjusted EBITDA margin for our Advisory and Global Workplace Solutions segments expanded approximately 70 basis points. Finally, our consolidated results also reflect negative foreign exchange translation impacts of 2% and 1% to fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, respectively. 
Now for an update on our business fundamentals, I will turn the call over to Bob."

As you've seen, we reported another strong quarter in our services business driven by double-digit revenue growth in global Occupier Outsourcing, U.S. advisory property sales and commercial mortgage origination",230,"Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we reported another strong quarter in our services business driven by double-digit revenue growth in global Occupier Outsourcing, U.S. advisory property sales and commercial mortgage origination. We continue to benefit from strong organic growth and operating leverage in our combined services businesses. 
Additionally, in early October, we completed the acquisition of Telford Homes, expanding our development capabilities into the U.K. where the multifamily rental market is poised for long-term secular growth. We were able to acquire Telford as an attractive valuation, reflecting market concerns due to Brexit without materially altering our capital structure or engaging in a lengthy integration process.
We believe the very successful Telford team will be able to accomplish more on CBRE's platform than they could on their own. Strategic M&A is core to our strategy, and Telford represents the type of acquisition you should expect from CBRE. Sourcing, underwriting and integrating acquisitions is a competitive advantage for our company.
Both our M&A and our senior business leadership teams are deeply experienced at targeting, underwriting, closing and integrating acquisition opportunities. Since 2014, we have deployed nearly $2.6 billion for acquisitions that have bolstered our growth, our ability to serve our clients and our strategic position in the marketplace.

Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 8% fee revenue growth during the quarter. Strong operating leverage drove margin expansion of about 140 basis points and 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA.Over half the margin expansio",1397,"Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 5, our Advisory Services segment generated 8% fee revenue growth during the quarter. Strong operating leverage drove margin expansion of about 140 basis points and 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Over half the margin expansion resulted from commercial mortgage origination gains. The remainder is attributable to well-disciplined operating expense management against a healthy revenue growth. We saw double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in local currency from both our Americas and non-Americas region.
Our North Asia division saw the strongest adjusted EBITDA growth of any geographical region in the quarter as outstanding capital markets activity in Japan more than offset soft market conditions in Hong Kong and China. These 2 markets make up our Greater China region and represent less than approximately 1% of CBRE's total adjusted EBITDA.
Global capital markets, which includes both property sales and commercial mortgage originations set the pace for revenue growth, accelerating to 11%, up significantly from 1% in the first half of the year. This acceleration was led by our commercial mortgage origination revenue growth of nearly 24%, which was fueled by an increasing number of larger transactions and market share gain with private entities including life insurers, conduits and credit funds.
Property sales revenue growth was led by the United States, which increased by 19% on meaningful market share gains. This is primarily driven by a sizable number of larger transactions and notable strength in the Northeast region of the United States. 
Outside the Americas, property sales declined 6%, which includes a negative FX impact of 3% and continued weakness in residential sales in the Pacific region and parts of Asia. Excluding Asia Pacific residential, property sales growth outside the Americas was flat in local currency. Capital markets activity, particularly in the Americas, continued to be bolstered by the ample supply of capital, focused on investing in commercial real estate, strong occupancy rates and measured supply growth.
Advisory leasing revenue growth rose 4% or 5% in local currency terms, a healthy increase against 17% growth in the prior year's quarter. 
U.S. leasing revenue grew by 4% and was driven by clients in technology, financial services and manufacturing sectors, which accounted for nearly 60% of U.S. leasing revenue. We also saw a notable acceleration in account-based deals in the quarter. Inclusive of activity now recorded in our Global Workplace Solutions segment, Americas leasing revenue rose 7% for the quarter. 
Leasing with co-working companies drove less than 4% of our trailing 12-month leasing revenue in the U.S. and less than 3% of U.S. leasing revenue in the third quarter. These figures include both negotiating leases for co-working companies as tenant rep or landlord agent and placing occupiers in co-working space.
The demand for co-working remains a relatively small component of the overall U.S. market with no single operator representing more than 0.5% of the total. While flexible office space solutions will continue to grow, this sector is not large enough to swing overall commercial real estate market fundamentals in any meaningful way.
Turning to our Global Workplace Solutions segment, on Slide 6, we produced 15% adjusted EBITDA growth with the strength across our 3 lines of business: facilities management; project management; and our transactions. Importantly, our customer base also continued to be composed of large high-quality companies with approximately 85% of our GWS revenue generated from investment grade rated clients. 
Fee revenue growth of 21% reflects continued strong momentum for our Occupier Outsourcing services, boosted by landing large new enterprise client engagement and expanding existing relationships. In addition, fee revenue growth outpaced total revenue growth due to a greater weighting of fixed-price contracts. 
Slightly negative operating leverage reflected a couple of challenging accounts in Europe, which we expect to remediate next year and a handful of choppier expense items and noncash accounting adjustments, which totaled $12 million in the quarter. 
Our business has the distinct competitive advantage in securing large, integrated global accounts. One recent example is Novartis, which has appointed us to provide facilities, Project Management and transaction and advisory services on worldwide basis. The 70 million square foot portfolio represents one of our largest ever new contracts for our Global Workplace Solutions team.
Our pipeline for the outsourcing business remains robust, and we're seeing more clients contracting for a bigger bundle of services. On a year-to-date basis, nearly 40% of the adjusted EBITDA associated with new contracts was derived from customers purchasing the full suite of services offered by our outsourcing business, which is up significantly both sequentially and from the prior year period.
Turning to Slide 7 and our Real Estate Investments segment. Adjusted EBITDA fell by over $70 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the timing of development transactions. Beyond development, strong growth in our Investment Management business offset our incremental investment in our new flexible office space business, Hana. Development adjusted EBITDA was slightly below our expectations for the third quarter as a couple of smaller deals are now expected to transact in 2020. 
We also now expect one larger $20 million adjusted EBITDA deal, previously anticipated in the fourth quarter to transact in 2020. Our development business' financial performance has natural variability from quarter-to-quarter. The market overall remains very healthy and our combined in-process and pipeline portfolio reached a record level, rising $1.3 billion, sequentially. 
Investor enthusiasm for development projects remains high and cap rates for our Class A projects remained tight. While our timing expectations have shifted for a few specific developments, our pricing expectations have not changed. 
Performance in our investment management business continued to improve, contributing just over $20 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. 
Assets Under Management would have reached a new record level, but for a $1.7 billion headwind from foreign currency translation. Capital raising also remains elevated with more than $12 billion raised over the past 12 months. 
Finally, our new co-working concept, Hana, opened its first location in Dallas in the quarter with units planned in Southern California and London by early next year. We believe demand for flexible workspace is here to stay and landlords and occupiers are increasingly gravitating to high-quality operators with strong financial sponsorship. 
Our pipeline for future Hana locations focuses on major CBDs and includes a variety of structures including management, partnership agreements as well as leases. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are very focused on pursuing a disciplined approach to allocating capital at CBRE. Over the last 5 years, we have strengthened our balance sheet, which is evidenced by our reduction in net leverage and our more than $3 billion of liquidity. This capital structure provides us a solid foundation to execute our capital allocation strategy. Our priorities for capital allocation are focused on investing in growth through tech-enablement CapEx, accretive M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $770 million of capital, including our recent Telford acquisition and share repurchases in October. We have also invested over $142 million on capital expenditures, net of concession, with well over half of this deployed for technology-focused investments, that enable our professionals to bring higher levels of service to our clients with greater efficiency. 
In addition, as of today, CBRE has repurchased over $145 million of shares in 2019, including our recently initiated 10B5-1 program, which executed the repurchase of $100 million at an average price of $51.64 since the beginning of third quarter. 
Given our current and forecasted levels of leverage as well as our significant financial capacity, you can expect us to utilize share repurchases in a more programmatic way to both maintain flexibility around capital allocation and to provide a more consistent approach to returning capital to shareholders. 
Finally, with respect to our expectations for our full year 2019 outlook, due to the delayed timing of development deals, we now expect adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate Investments segment at or slightly below the low end of the $200 million to $220 million range we set in March, inclusive of a modest benefit from Telford in the fourth quarter. 
Nonetheless, we are maintaining our guidance range of $3.70 to $3.80 for full year adjusted EPS, as we expect strength in our services businesses to offset the impact of these delayed development deals. This implies 14% growth as the midpoint of our guidance range for 2019.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll turn the call back to Bob for his brief closing remarks."

So Ryan, I would say that what's happened with WeWork has had an impact on our Hana strategy that I would characterize as tactical, but it has not had an impact on the overall strategy. So in the short run, we're seeing some incremental inquiries from occupiers of Hana. We're seeing some incremental inquiries from landlords that are considering going in our direction that maybe weren't before. 
But in the long run, as Leah said, we see this co-working or flexible space market opportunity the way we saw it before, it's roughly 2% of the multi-tenant space around the world today. We continue to think it will go to as much as 10%. 
Our belief in that direction is driven by the work we've done with our occupiers around the world. We know that they expect a percentage of their occupancy in the future to be in this type of space and we think that's good. Our strategy for Hana is to start to carefully build a footprint with a bit more capital intensive model, i.e., more investment, more leases, and, over time, likely move to a model where we manage space, co-working space, that's owned by the landlords themselves. Our hypothesis is that over time, landlords are going to want a co-working space in their buildings because they believe their tenants are going to want it. They're likely going to want to control it because they want to control the tenancy. They view themselves as owning a lot of the downside so they want to own the upside, and we are positioning Hana to move in that direction if that's the direction the market moves. 
Nothing about our results with Hana in the short run have been impacted in any meaningful way relative to what we thought they would be."

It's, as a result, more institutional quality, better build-out, better data security, et cetera. It's got similar amenities in terms of food and beverage and so forth. 
And again, I can't stress enough, we are in the door working for a high percentage of the big occupiers around the world doing all kinds of flexible space work for them inside their spaces. We know what they want. 
We know they want a portion of their portfolio in this flex space format. If you look at what went on with occupiers historically, they basically said we're going to own some of our space, we're going to lease some of our space on a traditional basis and we'll -- on the very margin, we'll do a little bit of co-working. Well, that's changed. There is -- they think that co-working is going to be a material piece of their portfolio of occupancy going forward, and we've oriented our Hana concept to be consistent with that."

I would just say a lot of Real Estate Investment change is driven by timing, it's just not market changes that we're seeing around the development portfolio that we have in place. For example, one industrial project that we have, it's fully leased, but the triggering event for the recognition isn't until the tenants move in, and that won't happen until next year. And then we have a multifamily project that is scheduled to close and the buyer has a 30-day option extension if the exercise that but we fully expect that we close in Q4. So these aren't fundamentals drivers of change in terms of how we view cap rates or these asset transacting with respect to their cap rates. So I feel good about the Real Estate Investments business, and I'd say leasing and certainly the benefit from Telford and our capital markets business in GWS altogether will make up for that shift really in timing for those development project."

We've -- everything we're doing with our, what we call, our digital and technology strategy has emanated from building a strong team that can, first, create an excellent infrastructure base for us, data security, all of our -- the basic things we use around on our business. Chandra Dhandapani and her team came in and they've gotten that done. They've turned their attention along with our market-facing business leaders to what we call enablement technology, tools that our professionals use to secure business and deliver business to our clients. 
There is a large suite of tools spread across all our lines of businesses that they are working on. We have very specific adoption metrics for all the key tools we're using, and we're tracking adoption against those metrics. In many, many cases, we're satisfied with adoption in other cases we're trying to push adoption up. But there is a ton of focus on that in our business and there will continue to be a ton of focus on that. 
We don't talk externally about what those specific metrics are, et cetera. We consider that to be proprietary, but that's where our focus is now. We're shifting more and more of our spend to enablement tools and you should expect that trend to continue and we're in the budgeting process now, going through all kinds of efforts, jointly between our D&T team and our field people to figure out exactly which tools we're going to invest in, in 2020.

So there are things like robotics and workflow automation that are also benefiting the business. We also have solutions like Host that we're investing in to enhance the experience services that we provide for our occupier clients and investor clients. 
And then I would just say we've also invested from a M&A perspective into companies like FacilitySource that are enhancing our ability to win large GWS transactions and pursuits.
