Dow delivered its 13th cons",1770,"Thank you, Neal, and welcome back to Investor Relations. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, our results this quarter ending 2015 reflected the benefits of our continued discipline approach to execute on our priorities. Dow delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of operating EPS and EBITDA margin growth. Operating earnings per share increased 9% to $0.93 per share. Volume increased 4%, which represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. This includes 5% growth on our emerging regions led by greater China, which was up 10%. Operating EBITDA was $2.4 billion. Excluding the impact of divestitures, operating EBITDA rose more than $100 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating EBITDA margins expanded across all segments to 20.9%, the highest quarterly result since the first quarter of 2005. During the quarter, we also returned $2.7 billion shareholders through dividends and share repurchases with the closing of our Dow Chlorine Products transaction serving as a significant driver of improvement to our capital structure. We have included a full look back on the greater than $4.8 billion in consideration for the transaction in the appendix. And finally, at the very end of December, Dow received $1.5 billion in pretax proceeds through the sale of its direct ownership interest in EMI global to equate. 
Moving to our full year results, Dow reported operating EPS of $3.47 a share, a 12% increase year-over-year. We achieved operating EBITDA of $9.6 billion, a new high. Operating EBITDA margins expanded more than 360 basis points to 19.7%, representing the highest level in more than a decade, with gains reported in all operating segments reflecting our continued discipline and price volume management. Operating return on capital increased to 12.1% marking 3 consecutive years of expansion. We delivered $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the year, a $1 billion increase compared to last year. On an operating basis, this represents a third consecutive year of record cash flow from operations. We also continued to return significant cash to our shareholders. In 2015, we return $4.6 billion through paid dividends and share repurchases and we recently announced another increase to our quarterly dividend to a new historic high. Additionally, during the year, we announced a series of portfolio management milestones, which brought our total pretax value from portfolio actions since 2013 to more than $13.5 billion, coming in well ahead of both our committed target and time line. 
Moving on to our dashboard of key financial performance metrics on Slide 7, these highlights reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long-term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasingly reward our shareholders. And as you see here, we made significant progress against each one. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our net debt-to-cap to 24.8% from 37.3% in the year ago period and well below our 10-year average of 35.9%. Net debt to operating EBITDA declined to 0.9x versus 1.5x in the same quarter last year; and year-over-year, total cash and cash equivalents have increased by $2.9 billion. Further, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through paid dividends and share repurchases, with $1.5 billion related to the equity redemption from the Dow Chlorine Products transaction and an additional $700 million of stock buybacks in the quarter. We exited the year with operating return on capital of 12.1%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. 
Now let's turn to our segment results starting on Slide 9. Ag Sciences reported sales of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $1.9 billion in the year-ago period, impacted by continued lower crop, commodity prices, high channel inventories and ongoing currency headwinds. Operating EBITDA for the segment was essentially flat year-over-year as headwinds from pricing and the divestiture of AgroFresh were offset by the sale of non-strategic product lines and disciplined productivity actions we drove throughout 2015. Here, we were among the first movers in the industry that takes swift action and reduce our cost structure in response to market headwinds. During the year, sales of our new crop protection products grew 6% and we gained corn market share in the Americas. Looking ahead, to 2016, soft commodity prices are expected to continue, with the overall market projected to be down 3% to 5%. In this environment, we're focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves with new products, as well as continued self-help actions to deliver performance that continues to outpace that of our competitors. 
Consumer Solutions on Slide 10 achieved an all-time quarterly operating EBITDA record of $296 million. This reflects continued demand in the automotive and semiconductor sectors. Collectively, the businesses in the segment drove cost reductions in line with productivity initiatives and realized margin expansion from demand for innovative customer-focused solutions. Dow Automotive Systems had another strong quarter, led by demand for our science and engineering capabilities that improve fuel efficiency, safety and acoustic performance. In this business, we are leveraging our technology capabilities to outpace industry. For example, in North America we continue to make solid progress with electric vehicle manufacturers, where our content per vehicle averages 3x that of non-electric vehicles. In Consumer Care, volume gains in Asia and EMEA more than offset a transition in the Americas from powder-based detergent solutions to capsules. We also saw double-digit volume growth in target pharmaceutical and personal care markets and took action to respond to the weaker industrial markets by closing a less competitive cellulosic facility in West Virginia. Dow Electronic Materials expanded EBITDA once again, as semiconductor and Growth Technologies grew faster than the industry, driven by our technology differentiation that lowered the cost of ownership for advanced nodes. Looking ahead, we see margin improving our display business, driven by our core knowledge and our strength in LED backlight films. 
Turning to Slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions reported fourth quarter sales of $1.7 billion, down from the year ago period as volume gains in nearly all businesses were more than offset by price pressures from lower raw material costs and currency headwinds. Dow Building and Construction drove margin expansion through strength and construction chemical markets and our FR63 licensing efforts. Dow Coating Materials grew volume, led by industrial coatings. Looking ahead, we expect growth in our coatings business to outpace the market due to the commercial launch of 5 new vinyl acrylic binders. Performance Monomers remains in an ongoing global trough, and we are taking several actions. Shutting down 20% of our Deer Park acrylate capacity to reduce our merchant exposure, optimizing our turnaround and structural costs and continuing to explore coproducer supply agreements. In Energy & Water Solutions, our industry-leading reverse osmosis business saw double-digit growth driven by strong demand. During the quarter, our new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia also came online and will serve the growing need for water in the Middle East. Based on the market penetration and customer acceptance of our product, we expect to reach capacity on this asset very quickly. 
Turning to Performance Materials and chemicals, fourth quarter sales were down on a year-over-year basis driven primarily by the impact of the split off of Dow Chlorine Products and other divestitures as well as significant price and currency headwinds. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline as growth in ethylene glycol sales was more than often by weakness in the energy sector, along with the change in long-term supply arrangement. Our price volume management kept EBITDA flat in our core business, but that was offset by weakness in MBG pricing, as well as increased Sadara expenses as the site continues to progress startup of the new production units which drove down equity earnings. We reported another strong quarter in Polyurethanes as a result of self-help measures and a shift to a more specialized system house sales approach which achieved double-digit sales growth. Additionally, our new polyols facility in Thailand drove share gains and double-digit volume increases in Asia. 
Moving to Slide 13, our Performance Plastics segment delivered a fourth quarter operating EBITDA record of $1.3 billion driven by steady demand in all businesses and margin expansion in most geographic areas. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics sold a quarterly record polyethylene volume led primarily by double-digit gains in Asia and strong demand for Dow's innovative packaging solutions. In early December, the first polyethylene units began production at our Sadara joint venture and first shipments have already been received by our customers. Dow Elastomers reported double-digit growth in North America on continued customer demand for Dow products in transportation and infrastructure sectors. Our INFUSE Elastomers, which are sold into higher end footwear, saw strong volumes in the quarter. Additionally, an increase in consumer preference for SUVs resulted in higher per vehicle elastomer demand. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications saw double-digit operating EBITDA growth as well. 
This quarter's business performance continues to be underpinned by ongoing progress in our integration and feedstock flexibility. For example, Dow Europe produced almost half of its ethylene in 2015 from LPG, and we increased our European LPG cracking capability to over 60%. Some additional details on this topic are also in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me briefly cover our modeling guidance for the quarter and for 2016. On a year-over-year basis in 2016, we will have earnings catalysts from a full year of PDH impact and we have 2 positive drivers that will contribute to the back half of the year. The Dow Corning transaction and our enhancements to ethane cracking capabilities in Louisiana. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we will make further progress on our productivity initiatives to build on the $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015 by targeting an additional and incremental $300 million in 2016. We also see pension expense providing an approximately $250 million tailwind as well. We do see several headwinds, namely continued pressure from currency, the loss of earnings due to divestitures and soft ag fundamentals from continued lower crop prices on higher channel inventories. Specifically in the fourth quarter, we see demand fundamentals that continue to favor volume expansion in our targeted sectors. This will be tempered by higher turnaround activity on a sequential basis, as well as lost earnings from our recent portfolio management actions. Finally, we will continue to drive our $5 billion share purchase program forward. We expect to deliver $2 billion of share repurchases this year as our purchasing window likely opens up following the shareholder vote for the Dow-DuPont transaction. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew"

If you look to Slide 16, you'll see that 2015 in every regard was a transformative year for Dow. We delivered record results amidst an ever challenging macro environment, with 13 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition to the financial highlights that Howard just reviewed, we made further progress on our productivity goals through harmonizing our work processes, streamlining functional business support and optimizing our asset footprint. We're committed to achieve $300 million in 2015, and in fact, we overdelivered on this goal with $345 million realized. We compare to the first full year operating on Dow's new one instance IT platform. This world-class system represented the single largest implementation of SAP and is already delivering significant streamlining benefits while also enabling sharper business and geographic insights. We're delivering on our significant growth project milestones, celebrating first polyethylene product shipped from our Sadara joint venture and starting up the world's largest on purpose propylene facility which is making smooth and steady progress towards full rates. And, importantly, in a year with these significant operational projects coming online, we delivered our best ever EHNS performance. And last, but certainly not the least, 2015 was a truly transformative year on the strategic front. We drove major actions on our joint ventures, with the sale of our direct ownership in new global take weight, step acquisition of Univation Technologies and then announced restructuring of the ownership of Dow Corning Silicons business. We split up Dow Chlorine Products and released further value through our transactions of the AgroFresh, sodium borohydride businesses and Agnus businesses and of course, in December, we announced the signing of a historic transaction with DuPont, and we intend to create 3 focused industry leaders in agriculture, material science and specialty products, releasing tremendous value for our owners. I'll have more to say about our progress here in just a moment. 
Turn to Slide 17. In summary, 2015 represents the culmination of actions we have taken over a 3-year period to increase cash flow generation, drive self-help measures, enhance the quality of our portfolio, capture growth for the future and increasingly reward shareholders. 2015 will go down as of the most significant year in Dow's storied history and quarter 4, the exclamation mark on the year. This direction was set by the thorough review of the Dow board and executive team launched in 2013 to identify clear actions to unlock additional value for our shareholders. As part of that review, we set very focused goals, including to grow EPS by 10% a year over the long-term; to enhance our traditional EVA focus; to continue to reduce our debt; and to go narrower and deeper in key end markets and divest non-core businesses including Dow's exiting chlorine, our original foundational product, all with a relentless focus on shareholder value creation and long-term growth. We have made significant progress against this strategic roadmap, and these actions have delivered impressive financial results and returns to our owners over that 3-year period, including $22 billion in cash flow from operations; ROC improvement of 450 basis points from 7.6% to 12.1%; more than $8 billion reduction in net debt; and most importantly, $12 billion distributed through share repurchases and paid dividends. 
Turning to Slide 18, these results are also underpinned by our intense focus at driving an EVA culture and performance using a best owner mindset as our key lens and taking actions on multiple fronts lowering our working capital and asset base through our multiyear productivity actions, most recently our Dow 10.0 streamlining program and our aforementioned world-class IT capabilities, driving synergies through our corporate base, further leveraging our functional expertise across the enterprise to increase sales, optimizing purchasing and driving a lean corporate center and regional hubs. Capturing growth where growth exists while our cross and opportunities, maximizing our operating leverage and improving our sales mix. As a result, over these past 3 years, our EVA improvement has been significant, placing us in the 95th [ph] percentile relative to our peers. 
Turning to Slide 19, to keep this momentum going and build on the performance and portfolio actions of the past 3 years, we put in place clear earnings growth drivers for the delivering now and ramp-up in the near future. Our multiyear productivity push is already delivering bottom line results. Our mantra is one of continuous improvement. We did it in 2015, and we will continue with that same mindset into this year making even more progress towards our goal of $1 billion in savings over 3 years with 2017 being year 3. We are pleased we exceeded our $300 million productivity target, with a $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015. And in 2016, we have targeted to save an additional and incremental greater than $300 million. In fact, we are increasing our headcount reduction targets as part of this program by approximately 500 roles, bringing the total program headcount reduction to 2,200 roles that will be eliminated. Thus far, we have reduced just over 1,200 roles. Our strategic investments, including our U.S. Gulf Coast and Sidara projects, will significantly enhance our growth earnings profile. These projects are based on strong underlying fundamentals that delivered bottom line benefits in all scenarios, because of their low cost position and value add products. We are pleased with the startup of these growth facilities and we expect several additional units to come online, both on the U.S. Gulf Coast and Saudi Arabia in 2016. Another earnings drives comes from our restructuring on the ownership of Dow Corning, which we expect to close in the middle of this year. This transaction expected to yield more than $1 billion in additional annual EBITDA at full run rate synergies. Just all these drivers alone approach $4 billion of EBITDA contribution on a run rate basis. And of course, it's important to remember that we have additional levers in place that will benefit our portfolio depending on how market forces develop through the year. From a cash flow and future earnings potential view, these drives are indeed powerful. They all bolster our growth profile, expand the potential to serve our customers and release significant value for our shareholders. 
I will now review our 2016 market outlook and priorities for the year. So turning to Slide 21, we will continue to see growth in the 3 key markets in which our materials businesses compete: packaging, transportation and construction. All consumer-driven and innovation-based. These 3 markets have carried the strength that we saw at the end of 2015 into the first of 2016. The global economy continues to be volatile, and we see that trend persisting for the near term. However, we also see strong demand from consumers in the U.S., as well as in China and that plays well to our consumer driven portfolio, technologies and narrower and deeper market focus. From a macro perspective, we are in and expect to continue to be in oversupply of energy and agriculture markets. We see low energy prices being a net benefit to the consumer. We do not sell energy. What we produce and sell continues to see type and tightening supply/demand dynamics. Our differentiated solutions allow us to drive demand and capture value. And turning to the geographies, North America is expected to remain strong. Demand in Europe will continue to improve. And Latin America will have mixed returns across the region. We also expecting continued growth in China, driven by demand from our consumer targeted solutions. And finally, in this volatile macro environment, expect us to control what we can control, expect us to improve our productivity, expect us to control cost and expect us to deliver the growth projects we have in place. 
Turning to Slide 22 and looking ahead, 2016 is primed to be another big year for Dow. And our teams are squarely aligned around 3 clear priorities. Priority one, delivering our 2016 plan despite these volatile macro conditions. Here, you can expect us to continue controlling the things we can control, driving our productivity initiatives, realizing the benefits of our commercialized innovation and executing ongoing price volume discipline. We will continue to reduce costs and expand margins. Two, close of Dow Corning transaction by midyear and deliver the related synergies. And three, move swiftly through the key stage gates of the Dow-DuPont transaction. Close merge go, realize synergies on an accelerated basis and prep the intended spins. The makeup of the teams and the time line of the transaction is available in more detail in the appendix. Due to the same slides DuPont provided during their earnings call last week. I reiterate Ed's comments that he made during the call. We're working on an accelerated time frame to close the merger and deliver the synergies and the intended spins. The synergy estimates of $3 billion cost and $1 billion growth are indeed a floor, not a ceiling. 
In sum, you should expect in 2016 the same resolute focus our Dow team has demonstrated over these past several years. And speaking of our Dow team, we also announced this morning that Jim Fitterling has been appointed to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of Dow. Since the announced merger with DuPont, Jim has been and will continue to work closely alongside me in running Dow's operations. He will play a key role in supporting me to drive the successful completion of the merger and unleashing the full value of the 3 intended subsequent independent companies. His appointment is extremely well-deserved and a reflection of his abilities and our commitment to our company over his 30-plus year career.  Now we anticipate that the entire process to close the merger and sets the companies up to be spun will take about 1.5 years foretold. I look forward to working with  Jim and also with Howard Ungerleider in the office of the CEO over that time period to bring that entire process to a successful conclusion and enable a successful leadership handover to coordinate with my own planned transition out of the company, which will occur when we are set up to be spun off, but no later than the end of Q2 2017. 
We will continue to drive our strategic agenda and the transformational steps we are undertaking. We will deliver further productivity gains and cost reductions. We will innovate and add value for our customers, and we will drive enhanced returns for our shareholders. And we will deliver this exciting new phase of growth manifested in the creation of Dow-DuPont and its 3 destination companies.

That is quite a bit ahead of anybody else, and those were the first ones out of the ground and are going to continue to be the ones you see in the first wave. When the second wave comes is anybody's guess at this point. Some people are saying '18, I think, it might even be slighted to '19 and '20.

Look, I think every industrial company, every company out there, is not giving any sort of firmness on any of these years in front of us. That's not new news. I think 2016, 2017, even with election-year in front of us in the United States, the macro is very difficult to to predict. What we are seeing though is very strong trend lines which we set in our core, which I think gives us strong views towards our ability to grow earnings, is this notion that the consumer is active in the United States, and that the consumer is becoming increasingly active in China, and then actually there's the beginnings of good spending in Europe. We do believe low-energy price, low oil prices are seeping in the economy, and that's creating a stimulus that actually is of the right kind. And I think if that stimulus continues to be what it is, short of major tectonic events geopolitically, I think the confidence in the real economy will emerge continually from the consumer. And, frankly, that is what we're seeing in our results. We're seeing it in our product mix, which we've been working hard to position, to be B2B to C, and I think when Jim talked about packaging and  plastics, and I could say the same about anything, elastomers, our water business, our automotive business, we're seeing strong demand in construction chemicals in Western Europe. I think it takes away this notion of back-loading. It takes this notion of 13 quarters in a row of continuing that trend. And that then speaks to the other side of it. Most of the scenario plan these days, we don't actually say this is the condition. It's going to be 2.5% GDP, and then go from there. None of us do that. We bracket it and then we pivot self-help appropriately. And if we have to go down further in cost base and productivity actions because markets don't manifest themselves, we take out more costs. And having an IT platform that's leveraged, we can do that pretty quick. We can move to cost structure with demand and price volume management and that's what's you've seen from us.

But otherwise, that was real productivity that really drove that. You remember, we were one of the first, if not the first, Ag player to do restructuring, and that was part of our announcement earlier in 2015. To your question on whether we could grow EBITDA in 2016, that's going to be a very tough slog on an operating basis, even with productivity considering high channel inventories, low crop prices and just lower overall demand. Remember, we're forecasting when we see the market to decline between 3% and 5%. It's going to be tough.

I mentioned earlier, I think in the Q&A that when you look at 2016 specifically on a Performance Plastics side, you're looking at a 50-plus or minus million-dollar tailwind because those assets have already started, so we've got first product out in December. The mixed feed cracker is going to be coming up and another couple of Polyurethane units throughout 2016. But in PMC, Performance Materials and Chemicals, you're looking at about $100 million to $200 million headwinds because they're in the really steep part of the S curve because their assets are being built and finalized in 2016. We've got some capacity in PMC not coming on until really the back half of the year. We still have a view that our long-term average is $500 million put between equity earnings and the commission structure that we're going to get, as we are marketing the product for Sadara outside of the Middle East zone. That's a long-term average, and that is after the whole complex has started up. So that would start to hit those numbers in the post-2018, 2019 time frame. We still feel pretty good about the project overall."

I mean, the absolute hand in glove combination of what we have now seen, Jim and Howard and I have done a trip out to Des Moines, to Johnson and seen the Pioneer capability up-close and personal. It's first class, it has incredible technology not just, of course, in trait delivery, mechanisms but it's automated, it's technology-rich, it's got capabilities on the climactic side, and what the Dow chemistry brings and the Dow traits bring, especially in the combination of traits that we can bring on herbicides and insecticides is a winning hand. As you know, we have the next series of traits coming out in the marketplace. So everyone has always said, and this is the greatest combination you can put in the sector, and everything we've seen since the announcement and the work we've done has just doubled down and tripled down. We cannot be more excited. Indianapolis and Dow AgroSciences, and the people there were excited. Property has always been a property we talked about in terms of where the destination might be. There's no secret that Dow never saw itself as the natural owner long-term, but the combination waiting for it to come the way it did, was a winning hand. And so we'll have a lot more to say. There are some holes in the repertoire that we have to address, but I can't wait until the merger occurs and this company is set up for them to identify how they're going to grow with this complementarity."

Turning to Slide 6, our results this quarter ending 2015 reflected the benefits of our continued discipline approach to execute on our priorities. Dow delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of operating EPS and EBITDA margin growth. Operating earnings per share increased 9% to $0.93 per share. Volume increased 4%, which represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. This includes 5% growth on our emerging regions led by greater China, which was up 10%. Operating EBITDA was $2.4 billion. Excluding the impact of divestitures, operating EBITDA rose more than $100 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating EBITDA margins expanded across all segments to 20.9%, the highest quarterly result since the first quarter of 2005. During the quarter, we also returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, with the closing of our Dow Chlorine Products transaction serving as a significant driver of improvement to our capital structure. We've included a full look back on the greater than $4.8 billion in consideration for the transaction in the appendix. And finally, at the very end of December, Dow received $1.5 billion in pretax proceeds through the sale of its direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE. 
Moving to our full year results, Dow reported operating EPS of $3.47 a share, a 12% increase year-over-year. We achieved operating EBITDA of $9.6 billion, a new high. Operating EBITDA margins expanded more than 360 basis points to 19.7%, representing the highest level in more than a decade, with gains reported in all operating segments reflecting our continued discipline and price volume management. Operating return on capital increased to 12.1%, marking 3 consecutive years of expansion. We delivered $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the year, $1 billion increase compared to last year. And on an operating basis, this represents the third consecutive year of record cash flow from operations. 
We also continued to return significant cash to our shareholders. In 2015, we return $4.6 billion through paid dividends and share repurchases and we recently announced another increase to our quarterly dividend to a new historic high. Additionally, during the year, we announced a series of portfolio management milestones which brought our total pretax value from portfolio actions since 2013 to more than $13.5 billion, coming in well ahead of both our committed target and timeline. 
Moving on to our dashboard of key financial performance metrics on Slide 7, these highlights reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long-term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasingly reward our owners. And as you see here, we've made significant progress against each one. 
In the fourth quarter, we reduced our net debt-to-cap to 24.8% from 37.3% in the year-ago period and well below our 10-year average of 35.9%. Net debt to operating EBITDA declined to 0.9x versus 1.5x in the same quarter last year. And year-over-year, total cash and cash equivalents have increased by $2.9 billion. Further, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through paid dividends and share repurchases, with $1.5 billion related to the equity redemption from the Dow Chlorine Products transaction and an additional $700 million of stock buybacks in the quarter. We exited the year with operating return on capital of 12.1%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. 
Now let's turn to our segment results, starting on Slide 9. Ag Sciences reported sales of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $1.9 billion in the year-ago period, impacted by continued lower crop, commodity prices, high channel inventories and ongoing currency headwinds. Operating EBITDA for the segment was essentially flat year-over-year as headwinds from pricing and the divestiture of AgroFresh were offset by the sale of non-strategic product lines and disciplined productivity actions we drove throughout 2015. Here, we were among the first movers in the industry that takes swift action and reduce our cost structure in response to market headwinds.  During the year, sales of our new crop protection products grew 6% and we gained corn market share in the Americas. Looking ahead, to 2016, soft commodity prices are expected to continue, with the overall market projected to be down 3% to 5%. 
In this environment, we're focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves with new products, as well as continued self-help actions to deliver performance that continues to outpace that of our competitors. 
Consumer Solutions on Slide 10 achieved an all-time quarterly operating EBITDA record of $296 million. This reflects continued demand in the automotive and semiconductor sectors. Collectively, the businesses in this segment drove cost reductions in line with productivity initiatives and realized margin expansion from demand for innovative customer-focused solutions. 
Dow Automotive Systems had another strong quarter, led by demand for our science and engineering capabilities that improve fuel efficiency, safety and acoustic performance. In this business, we are leveraging our technology capabilities to outpace industry. For example, in North America we continue to make solid progress with electric vehicle manufacturers where our content per vehicle averages 3x that of non-electric vehicles. 
In Consumer Care, volume gains in Asia and EMEA more than offset a transition in the Americas from powder-based detergent solutions to capsules. We also saw double-digit volume growth in target pharmaceutical and personal care markets and took action to respond to the weaker industrial markets by closing a less competitive cellulosic facility in West Virginia. 
Dow Electronic Materials expanded EBITDA once again, as Semiconductor and Growth Technologies grew faster than the industry, driven by our technology differentiation that lowered the cost of ownership for advanced nodes. Looking ahead, we see margin improving our display business, driven by our core knowledge and our strength in LED backlight films. 
Turning to Slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions reported fourth quarter sales of $1.7 billion, down from the year ago period as volume gains in nearly all businesses were more than offset by price pressures from lower raw material costs and currency headwinds. Dow Building & Construction drove margin expansion through strength and construction chemical markets and our FR63 licensing efforts. Dow Coating Materials grew volume, led by industrial coatings. Looking ahead, we expect growth in our coatings business to outpace the market due to the commercial launch of 5 new vinyl acrylic binders. Performance Monomers remains in an ongoing global trough, and we are taking several actions. Shutting down 20% of our Deer Park acrylate capacity to reduce our merchant exposure, optimizing our turnaround and structural costs and continuing to explore coproducer supply agreements. In Energy & Water Solutions, our industry-leading reverse osmosis business saw double-digit growth driven by strong demand. During the quarter, our new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia also came online and will serve the growing need for water in the Middle East. Based on the market penetration and customer acceptance of our product, we expect to reach capacity on this asset very quickly. 
Turning to Performance Materials and chemicals, fourth quarter sales were down on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by the impact of the split off of Dow Chlorine Products and other divestitures, as well as significant price and currency headwinds. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline as growth in ethylene glycol sales was more than often by weakness in the energy sector, along with the change in long-term supply arrangement. Our price volume management kept EBITDA flat in our core business, but that was offset by weakness in MBG [ph] pricing, as well as increased Sadara expenses as the site continues to progress startup of the new production units which drove down equity earnings. We reported another strong quarter in Polyurethanes as a result of self-help measures and a shift to a more specialized system house sales approach which achieved double-digit sales growth. Additionally, our new polyols facility in Thailand drove share gains and double-digit volume increases in Asia. 
Moving to Slide 13, our Performance Plastics segment delivered a fourth quarter operating EBITDA record of $1.3 billion driven by steady demand in all businesses and margin expansion in most geographic areas. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics sold a quarterly record polyethylene volume, led primarily by double-digit gains in Asia and strong demand for Dow's innovative packaging solutions. In early December, the first polyethylene units began production at our Sadara joint venture and first shipments have already been received by our customers.  Dow Elastomers reported double-digit growth in North America on continued customer demand for Dow products in the transportation and infrastructure sectors. Our INFUSE elastomers, which are sold into higher end footwear, saw strong volumes in the quarter. Additionally, an increase in consumer preference for SUVs resulted in higher per vehicle elastomer demand.  Dow Electrical and Telecommunications saw double-digit operating EBITDA growth as well. 
This quarter's business performance continues to be underpinned by ongoing progress in our integration and feedstock flexibility. For example, Dow Europe produced almost half of its ethylene in 2015 from LPG, and we increased our European LPG cracking capability to over 60%. Some additional details on this topic are also in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me briefly cover our modeling guidance for the quarter and for 2016. On a year-over-year basis in 2016, we will have earnings catalysts from a full year of PDH impact and we have 2 positive drivers that will contribute to the back half of the year, the Dow Corning transaction and our enhancements to ethane cracking capabilities in Louisiana. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we will make further progress on our productivity initiatives to build on the $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015 by targeting an additional and incremental $300 million in 2016. We also see pension expense providing an approximately $250 million tailwind as well. We do see several headwinds, namely continued pressure from currency, the loss of earnings due to divestitures and soft ag fundamentals from continued lower crop prices on higher channel inventories. Specifically in the fourth quarter, we see demand fundamentals that continue to favor volume expansion in our targeted sectors. This will be tempered by higher turnaround activity on a sequential basis, as well as lost earnings from our recent portfolio management actions. Finally, we will continue to drive our $5 billion share purchase program forward. We expect to deliver $2 billion of share repurchases this year as our purchasing window likely opens up following the shareholder vote for the Dow-DuPont transaction. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew"

If you look at Slide 16, you'll see that 2015 in every regard was a transformative year for Dow. We delivered record results amidst an ever-challenging macro environment, with 13 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition to the financial highlights that Howard just reviewed, we made further progress on our productivity goals through harmonizing our work processes, streamlining functional business support and optimizing our asset footprint. We committed to achieve $300 million in 2015, and in fact, we over-delivered on this goal with $345 million realized. We compare to the first full year operating on Dow's new one instance IT platform. This world-class system represented the single largest implementation of SAP and it is already delivering significant streamlining benefits while also enabling sharper business and geographic insights. 
We're delivering on our significant growth project milestones, celebrating first polyethylene product shipped from our Sadara joint venture and starting up the world's largest on-purpose propylene facility which is making smooth and steady progress towards full rates. And importantly, in a year with these significant operational projects coming online, we delivered our best ever EH&S performance. 
And last, but certainly not the least, 2015 was a truly transformative year on the strategic front. We drove major actions on our joint ventures, with the sale of our direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE, the step acquisition of Univation Technologies and the announced restructuring of the ownership of Dow Corning Silicones business. We split up Dow Chlorine Products and released further value through our transactions of the AgroFresh, Sodium Borohydride and Angus businesses. And of course, in December, we announced the signing of a historic transaction with DuPont and the intend to create 3 focused industry leaders in agriculture, material science and specialty products, releasing tremendous value for our owners. I'll have more to say about our progress here in just a moment. 
If we turn to Slide 17, in summary, 2015 represents the culmination of actions we have taken over a 3-year period to increase cash flow generation, drive self-help measures, enhance the quality of our portfolio, capture growth for the future and increasingly reward our shareholders. 2015 will go down as the most significant year in Dow's storied history, and quarter 4, the exclamation mark on the year. This direction was set by the thorough review of the Dow Board and executive team launched in 2013 to identify clear actions to unlock additional value for our shareholders. As part of that review, we set very focused goals, including: To grow EPS by 10% a year over the long-term; to enhance our traditional EVA focus; to continue to reduce our debt; and to go narrower and deeper in key end markets and divest non-core businesses including Dow's exiting chlorine, our original foundational product, all with a relentless focus on shareholder value creation and long-term growth. We have made significant progress against this strategic roadmap and these actions have delivered impressive financial results and returns to our owners over that 3-year period, including: $22 billion in cash flow from operations; ROC improvement of 450 basis points, from 7.6% to 12.1%; more than $8 billion reduction in net debt; and most importantly, $12 billion distributed through share repurchases and paid dividends. 
Turning to Slide 18, these results are also underpinned by our intense focus in driving an EVA culture and performance using a best owner mindset as our key lens and taking actions on multiple  fronts; lowering our working capital and asset base through our multiyear productivity actions, most recently our Dow 10.0 streamlining program and our aforementioned world-class IT capabilities; driving synergies through our corporate base, further leveraging our functional expertise across the enterprise to increase sales, optimizing purchasing and driving a lean corporate center and regional hubs; capturing growth where growth exists via cross-selling opportunities, maximizing our operating leverage and improving our sales mix. As a result, over these past 3 years, our EVA improvement has been significant, placing us in the 95th percentile relative to our peers. 
Turning to Slide 19, to keep this momentum going and build on the performance and portfolio actions of the past 3 years, we put in place clear earnings growth drivers that are delivering now and ramp-up in the near future. Our multiyear productivity push is already delivering bottom line results. Our mantra is one of continuous improvement. We did it in 2015, and we will continue with that same mindset into this year, making even more progress towards our goal of $1 billion in savings over 3 years with 2017 being year 3. We are pleased we exceeded our $300 million productivity target, with a $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015. And in 2016, we have targeted to save an additional and incremental greater than $300 million. In fact, we are increasing our headcount reduction target as part of this program by approximately 500 roles, bringing the total program headcount reduction to 2,200 roles that will be eliminated. Thus far, we have reduced just over 1,200 roles. Our strategic investments, including our U.S. Gulf Coast and Sidara projects, will significantly enhance our go forward earnings profile. These projects are based on strong underlying fundamentals that deliver bottom line benefits in all scenarios, because of their low cost position and value add products. We are pleased with the startup of these growth facilities and we expect several additional units to come online, both on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in  Saudi Arabia in 2016. 
Another earnings driver comes from our restructuring on the ownership of Dow Corning, which we expect to close in the middle of this year. This transaction expected to yield more than $1 billion in additional annual EBITDA at full run rate synergies. 
Just all these drivers alone approach $4 billion of EBITDA contribution on a run rate basis. And of course, it's important to remember that we have additional levers in place that will benefit our portfolio depending on how market forces develop through the year. From a cash flow and future earnings potential view, these drives are indeed powerful. They all bolster our growth profile, expand the potential to serve our customers and release significant value for our shareholders. 
I will now review our 2016 market outlook and priorities for the year. So turning to Slide 21. We will continue to see growth in the 3 key markets in which our materials businesses compete, packaging, transportation and construction. All consumer-driven and innovation-based. These 3 markets have carried the strength that we saw at the end of 2015 into the first month of 2016. The global economy continues to be volatile and we see that trend persisting for the near term. However, we also see strong demand from consumers in the U.S., as well as in China and that plays well to our consumer-driven portfolio, technologies and narrower and deeper market focus. From a macro perspective, we are in and expect to continue to be in oversupply of energy and agriculture markets. We see low energy prices being a net benefit to the consumer. We do not sell energy. What we produce and sell continues to see tight and supply -- and tightening supply/demand dynamics. Our differentiated solutions allow us to drive demand and capture value. 
And turning to the geographies, North America is expected to remain strong, demand in Europe will continue to improve and Latin America will have mixed returns across the region. We also expect continued growth in China, driven by demand for our consumer-targeted solutions. 
And finally, in this volatile macro environment, expect us to control what we can control, expect us to improve our productivity, expect us to control cost and expect us to deliver the growth projects we have in place. 
Turning to Slide 22 and looking ahead, 2016 is primed to be another big year for Dow, and our teams are squarely aligned around 3 clear priorities. 
Priority one, delivering our 2016 plan despite these volatile macro conditions. Here, you can expect us to continue controlling the things we can control: Driving our productivity initiatives, realizing the benefits of our commercialized innovation and executing ongoing price volume discipline. We will continue to reduce costs and expand margins. Two, close the Dow Corning transaction by midyear and deliver the related synergies.  And three, move swiftly through the key stage gates of the Dow-DuPont transaction, close MergeCo, realize synergies on an accelerated basis and prep the intended spins. The makeup of the teams and the timeline for the transaction is available in more detail in the appendix using the same slides DuPont provided during their earnings call last week. I reiterate Ed's comments that he made during the call. We are working on an accelerated time frame to close the merger and deliver the synergies and the intended spins. The synergy estimates of $3 billion cost and $1 billion growth are indeed a floor, not a ceiling. 
In sum, you should expect in 2016 the same resolute focus our Dow team has demonstrated over these past several years. And speaking of our Dow team, we also announced this morning that Jim Fitterling has been appointed to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of Dow. Since the announced merger with DuPont, Jim has been and will continue to work closely alongside me in running Dow's operations. He will play a key role in supporting me to drive the successful completion of the merger and unleashing the full value of the 3 intended subsequent independent companies. His appointment is extremely well-deserved and a reflection of his abilities and our commitment to our company over his 30-plus year career.  Now we anticipate that the entire process to close the merger and set the companies up to be spun will take about 1.5 years foretold. I look forward to working with  Jim and also with Howard Ungerleider in the office of the CEO over that time period to bring that entire process to a successful conclusion and enable a successful leadership handover to coordinate with my own planned transition out of the company, which will occur when we are set up to be spun off, but no later than the end of Q2 2017. 
We will continue to drive our strategic agenda and the transformational steps we are undertaking. We will deliver further productivity gains and cost reductions. We will innovate and add value for our customers, and we will drive enhanced returns for our shareholders. And we will deliver this exciting new phase of growth manifested in the creation of Dow-DuPont and its 3 destination companies.

That is quite a bit ahead of anybody else. And those were the first ones out of the ground and are going to continue to be the ones you see in the first wave. When the second wave comes is anybody's guess at this point. Some people are saying '18. I think, it might even slide into '19 or '20.

Look, I think every industrial company, every company out there, is not giving any sort of firmness on any of these years in front of us. That's not new news. I think 2016, 2017, even with election year in front of us in the United States, the macros are very difficult to predict. What we are seeing though is very strong trend lines which we set in our core, which I think gives us strong views towards our ability to grow earnings, is this notion that the consumer is active in the United States, and that consumer is becoming increasingly active in China, and then actually, there's the beginnings of good spending in Europe. We do believe low energy price, low oil prices are seeping into the economy, and that's creating a stimulus that actually is of the right kind. And I think if that stimulus continues to be what it is, short of major tectonic events geopolitically, I think the confidence in the real economy will emerge continually from the consumer. And frankly, that is what we're seeing in our results. We're seeing it in our product mix, which we've been working hard to position, to be B2B to C, and I think what Jim talked about packaging and  plastics, and I could say the same about anything, elastomers, our water business, our automotive business, we're seeing strong demand in construction chemicals in Western Europe. I think it takes away this notion of back-loading. It takes this notion of 13 quarters in a row continuing that trend. And that then speaks to the other side of it. Most of the scenario plan these days, we don't actually say this is the condition. It's going to be 2.5% GDP and then go from there. None of us do that. We bracket it and then we pivot self-help appropriately. And if we have to go down further in cost base, on productivity actions because markets don't manifest themselves, we take out more costs. And having an IT platform that's leveraged, we can do that pretty quick. We can move the cost structure with demand and price volume management, and that's what you've seen from us. So look, I think we have confidence in our machine, continuing to deliver and generate this cash."

So just to Andrew's point that you're able to adjust the cost structure going forward, is all of this kind of Dow-specific or dependent on the market? Or again, are we going to expect that these levels should continue on the volume and margin side?"

I'd say, Arun, the team has been very, very focused and aligned in all of the businesses, and I think you're starting to see that come through in the consecutive quarters of result. If I went through every one of these segments, the team knows what markets we're going after, they are well-armed with new innovative products from our pipeline, that are helping them to pick up market share, and so it's not just moving products with the commodity part of the cycle. They're very targeted on which geographies we want to grow in. If we'd started the quarter, we would have thought maybe fourth quarter would've been more dominated by emerging markets and more by developed markets instead of emerging markets. And what we saw was we saw strong performance in both. And so I think what you're seeing here is the culmination of just a lot of intense focus since about the middle of 2012 around our top line growth. And when you think top line growth for us, you should really focus on the volume right now, because what's happened with oil prices, the thing that shows through in revenue, oil price and currency. What you see on volume is sustainable."

So the first question on the operating -- underlying operating earnings, so look, on average, the Ag -- our Ag business, Dow AgroSciences, fills between 3 and 5 molecules a year on the Crop Protection side of the house. This is in line with the strategic intent where if we see products that are on the tail end of their life cycle, we can add significant value from our science and technology platform. So we did sell a couple of molecules in the fourth quarter. They were in the range of $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA contribution. So you need to back that out of the segment. But otherwise, that was real productivity that really drove that. You remember, we were one of the first, if not the first, Ag player to do restructuring, and that was part of our announcement earlier in 2015. To your question of whether we could grow EBITDA in 2016, that's going to be a very tough slog on an operating basis, even with productivity considering high channel inventories, low crop prices and just lower overall demand. Remember, we're forecasting we see the market to decline between 3% and 5%. So it's going to be tough. Our focus is continue to deliver the innovations, continue to deliver the growth on the Crop Protection side and the new products on the Seeds side and continue to drive productivity to  outpace the competition, and that's our focus."

Obviously, we have some plastics that go into the commodity segments and continue to be strong as well. You'll see a little bit of sales that are going into ethylene to the Olin deal, but that isn't going to be material to the numbers that are in front of you. And the other thing you see on the revenue line is revenue looks down pretty dramatically. But when you peel back the byproduct sales off the crackers, which are hydrocarbon and energy-type of byproducts that have moved with oil more on a one-to-one relationship, plastics has held up really well based on volume demand in the end markets, and we think that's going to continue."

The mixed feed cracker is going to be coming up and another couple of polyethylene units throughout 2016. But in PMC, Performance Materials & Chemicals, you're looking at about $100 million to $200 million headwind because they're in the really steep part of the S curve as their assets are being built and finalized in 2016 and we've got some capacity for PMC not coming on until really the back half of the year. We still have a view that our long-term average is $500 million, put between equity earnings and the commission structure, that we're going to get, as we are marketing the product for Sadara outside of the Middle East zone.

All I can say, Chris, is that the last several weeks of team discussions have just amplified or magnified the original pre-announcement of the merger work that was done by the teams. We had over 4,000 man hours of combination work in the Ag teams. The 2 Ag teams were on fire in terms of complementarity. I mean, the absolute hand in glove combination of what we have now seen, Jim and Howard and I have done a trip out to Des Moines, to Johnston and seen the Pioneer capability up-close and personal. It's first class. It has incredible technology not just, of course, in trait delivery, mechanisms but it's automated, it's technology-rich, it's got capabilities on the climactic side. And what the Dow chemistry brings and the Dow traits bring, especially the combination of traits that we can bring on herbicides, insecticides is a winning hand. As you know, we have the next series of traits coming out in the marketplace. So everyone has always said that this is the greatest combination you could put in the sector, and everything we've seen since the announcement and the work we've done has just doubled down and tripled down. We cannot be more excited. And Indianapolis, in Dow AgroSciences, we were down there and the people there were excited because the property's always been a property we've talked about in terms of where its destination might be. There's no secret that Dow never saw itself as the natural owner long-term. But the combination, waiting for it to come the way it did, was a winning hand. And so we will have a lot more to say. There are some holes in the repertoire that we'll have to address. But I can't wait until the merger occurs and this company is set up for them to identify how they're going to grow with this complementarity."

Turning to Slide 6, our results this quarter and in 2015 reflected the benefits of our continued disciplined approach to execute on our priorities. Dow delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of operating EPS and EBITDA margin growth. Operating earnings per share increased 9% to $0.93 per share. Volume increased 4%, which represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. This includes 5% growth in our emerging regions led by greater China, which was up 10%. Operating EBITDA was $2.4 billion. Excluding the impact of divestitures, operating EBITDA rose more than $100 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating EBITDA margins expanded across all segments to 20.9%, the highest quarterly result since the first quarter of 2005. During the quarter, we also returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, with the closing of our Dow Chlorine Products transaction serving as a significant driver of improvement to our capital structure. We've included a full look back on the greater than $4.8 billion in consideration for the transaction in the appendix. And finally, at the very end of December, Dow received $1.5 billion in pretax proceeds through the sale of its direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE. 
Moving to our full year results, Dow reported operating EPS of $3.47 a share, a 12% increase year-over-year. We achieved operating EBITDA of $9.6 billion, a new high. Operating EBITDA margins expanded more than 360 basis points to 19.7%, representing the highest level in more than a decade, with gains reported in all operating segments reflecting our continued discipline and price volume management. Operating return on capital increased to 12.1%, marking 3 consecutive years of expansion. We delivered $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the year, $1 billion increase compared to last year. And on an operating basis, this represents the third consecutive year of record cash flow from operations. 
We also continued to return significant cash to our shareholders. In 2015, we returned $4.6 billion through paid dividends and share repurchases and we recently announced another increase to our quarterly dividend to a new historic high. Additionally, during the year, we announced a series of portfolio management milestones which brought our total pretax value from portfolio actions since 2013 to more than $13.5 billion, coming in well ahead of both our committed target and timeline. 
Moving on to our dashboard of key financial performance metrics on Slide 7, these highlights reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long-term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasingly reward our owners. And as you see here, we've made significant progress against each one. 
In the fourth quarter, we reduced our net debt-to-cap to 24.8% from 37.3% in the year-ago period and well below our 10-year average of 35.9%. Net debt to operating EBITDA declined to 0.9x versus 1.5x in the same quarter last year. And year-over-year, total cash and cash equivalents have increased by $2.9 billion. Further, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through paid dividends and share repurchases, with $1.5 billion related to the equity redemption from the Dow Chlorine Products transaction and an additional $700 million of stock buybacks in the quarter. We exited the year with operating return on capital of 12.1%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. 
Now let's turn to our segment results, starting on Slide 9. Ag Sciences reported sales of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $1.9 billion in the year-ago period, impacted by continued lower crop, commodity prices, high channel inventories and ongoing currency headwinds. Operating EBITDA for the segment was essentially flat year-over-year as headwinds from pricing and the divestiture of AgroFresh were offset by the sale of non-strategic product lines and disciplined productivity actions we drove throughout 2015. Here, we were among the first movers in the industry to takes swift action and reduce our cost structure in response to market headwinds. During the year, sales of our new crop protection products grew 6% and we gained corn market share in the Americas. Looking ahead, to 2016, soft commodity prices are expected to continue, with the overall market projected to be down 3% to 5%. 
In this environment, we're focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves with new products, as well as continued self-help actions to deliver performance that continues to outpace that of our competitors. 
Consumer Solutions on Slide 10 achieved an all-time quarterly operating EBITDA record of $296 million. This reflects continued demand in the automotive and semiconductor sectors. Collectively, the businesses in this segment drove cost reductions in line with productivity initiatives and realized margin expansion from demand for innovative customer-focused solutions. 
Dow Automotive Systems had another strong quarter, led by demand for our science and engineering capabilities that improve fuel efficiency, safety and acoustic performance. In this business, we're leveraging our technology capabilities to outpace the industry. For example, in North America we continue to make solid progress with electric vehicle manufacturers where our content per vehicle averages 3x that of non-electric vehicles. 
In Consumer Care, volume gains in Asia and EMEA more than offset a transition in the Americas from powder-based detergent solutions to capsules. We also saw double-digit volume growth in target pharmaceutical and personal care markets and took action to respond to the weaker industrial markets by closing a less competitive cellulosic facility in West Virginia. 
Dow Electronic Materials expanded EBITDA once again, as Semiconductor and Growth Technologies grew faster than the industry, driven by our technology differentiation that lowered the cost of ownership for advanced nodes. Looking ahead, we see margin improving in our display business, driven by our core knowledge and our strength in LED backlight films. 
Turning to Slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions reported fourth quarter sales of $1.7 billion, down from the year ago period as volume gains in nearly all businesses were more than offset by price pressures from lower raw material costs and currency headwinds. Dow Building & Construction drove margin expansion through strength and construction in chemical markets and our FR63 licensing efforts. Dow Coating Materials grew volume, led by industrial coatings. Looking ahead, we expect growth in our coatings business to outpace the market due to the commercial launch of 5 new vinyl acrylic binders. Performance Monomers remains in an ongoing global trough, and we are taking several actions: shutting down 20% of our Deer Park acrylate capacity to reduce our merchant exposure, optimizing our turnaround and structural costs and continuing to explore coproducer supply agreements. In Energy & Water Solutions, our industry-leading reverse osmosis business saw double-digit growth driven by strong demand. During the quarter, our new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia also came online and will serve the growing need for water in the Middle East. Based on the market penetration and customer acceptance of our product, we expect to reach capacity on this asset very quickly. 
Turning to Performance Materials and chemicals, fourth quarter sales were down on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by the impact of the split off of Dow Chlorine Products and other divestitures, as well as significant price and currency headwinds. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline as growth in ethylene glycol sales was more than often by weakness in the energy sector, along with the change in long-term supply arrangement. Our price volume management kept EBITDA flat in our core business, but that was offset by weakness in MEG pricing, as well as increased Sadara expenses as the site continues to progress startup of the new production units which drove down equity earnings. We reported another strong quarter in Polyurethanes as a result of self-help measures and a shift to a more specialized system house sales approach which achieved double-digit sales growth. Additionally, our new polyols facility in Thailand drove share gains and double-digit volume increases in Asia. 
Moving to Slide 13, our Performance Plastics segment delivered a fourth quarter operating EBITDA record of $1.3 billion driven by steady demand in all businesses and margin expansion in most geographic areas. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics sold a quarterly record polyethylene volume, led primarily by double-digit gains in Asia and strong demand for Dow's innovative packaging solutions. In early December, the first polyethylene units began production at our Sadara joint venture and first shipments have already been received by our customers. Dow Elastomers reported double-digit growth in North America on continued customer demand for Dow products in the transportation and infrastructure sectors. Our INFUSE elastomers, which are sold into higher end footwear, saw strong volumes in the quarter. Additionally, an increase in consumer preference for SUVs resulted in higher per vehicle elastomer demand. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications saw double-digit operating EBITDA growth as well. 
This quarter's business performance continues to be underpinned by ongoing progress in our integration and feedstock flexibility. For example, Dow Europe produced almost half of its ethylene in 2015 from LPG, and we increased our European LPG cracking capability to over 60%. Some additional details on this topic are also in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me briefly cover our modeling guidance for the quarter and for 2016. On a year-over-year basis in 2016, we will have earnings catalysts from a full year of PDH impact and we have 2 positive drivers that will contribute to the back half of the year, the Dow Corning transaction and our enhancements to ethane cracking capabilities in Louisiana. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we will make further progress on our productivity initiatives to build on the $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015 by targeting an additional and incremental $300 million in 2016. We also see pension expense providing an approximately $250 million tailwind as well. We do see several headwinds, namely continued pressure from currency, the loss of earnings due to divestitures and soft ag fundamentals from continued lower crop prices on higher channel inventories. Specifically in the fourth quarter, we see demand fundamentals that continue to favor volume expansion in our targeted sectors. This will be tempered by higher turnaround activity on a sequential basis, as well as lost earnings from our recent portfolio management actions. Finally, we will continue to drive our $5 billion share repurchase program forward. We expect to deliver $2 billion of share repurchases this year as our purchasing window likely opens up following the shareholder vote for the Dow-DuPont transaction. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew."

If you look at Slide 16, you'll see that 2015 in every regard was a transformative year for Dow. We delivered record results amidst an ever-challenging macro environment, with 13 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition to the financial highlights that Howard just reviewed, we made further progress on our productivity goals through harmonizing our work processes, streamlining functional business support and optimizing our asset footprint. We committed to achieve $300 million in 2015, and in fact, we over-delivered on this goal with $345 million realized. We compare to the first full year operating on Dow's new one instance IT platform. This world-class system represented the single largest implementation of SAP and it is already delivering significant streamlining benefits while also enabling sharper business and geographic insights. 
We're delivering on our significant growth project milestones, celebrating first polyethylene product shipped from our Sadara joint venture and starting up the world's largest on-purpose propylene facility which is making smooth and steady progress towards full rates. And importantly, in a year with these significant operational projects coming online, we delivered our best ever EH&S performance. 
And last, but certainly not least, 2015 was a truly transformative year on the strategic front. We drove major actions on our joint ventures, with the sale of our direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE, the step acquisition of Univation Technologies and the announced restructuring of the ownership of Dow Corning Silicones business. We split up Dow Chlorine Products and released further value through our transactions of the AgroFresh, Sodium Borohydride and Angus businesses. And of course, in December, we announced the signing of a historic transaction with DuPont and the intent to create 3 focused industry leaders in agriculture, material science and specialty products, releasing tremendous value for our owners. I'll have more to say about our progress here in just a moment. 
If we turn to Slide 17, in summary, 2015 represents the culmination of actions we have taken over a 3-year period to increase cash flow generation, drive self-help measures, enhance the quality of our portfolio, capture growth for the future and increasingly reward our shareholders. 2015 will go down as the most significant year in Dow's storied history, and quarter 4, the exclamation mark on the year. This direction was set by the thorough review of the Dow Board and executive team launched in 2013 to identify clear actions to unlock additional value for our shareholders. As part of that review, we set very focused goals, including: to grow EPS by 10% a year over the long-term; to enhance our traditional EVA focus; to continue to reduce our debt; and to go narrower and deeper in key end markets and divest non-core businesses including Dow's exiting chlorine, our original foundational product, all with a relentless focus on shareholder value creation and long-term growth. We have made significant progress against this strategic roadmap and these actions have delivered impressive financial results and returns to our owners over that 3-year period, including: $22 billion in cash flow from operations; ROC improvement of 450 basis points, from 7.6% to 12.1%; more than $8 billion reduction in net debt; and most importantly, $12 billion distributed through share repurchases and paid dividends. 
Turning to Slide 18, these results are also underpinned by our intense focus in driving an EVA culture and performance using a best owner mindset as our key lens and taking actions on multiple  fronts; lowering our working capital and asset base through our multiyear productivity actions, most recently our Dow 10.0 streamlining program and our aforementioned world-class IT capabilities; driving synergies through our corporate base, further leveraging our functional expertise across the enterprise to increase sales, optimizing purchasing and driving a lean corporate center and regional hubs; capturing growth where growth exists via cross-selling opportunities, maximizing our operating leverage and improving our sales mix. As a result, over these past 3 years, our EVA improvement has been significant, placing us in the 95th percentile relative to our peers. 
Turning to Slide 19, to keep this momentum going and build on the performance and portfolio actions of the past 3 years, we put in place clear earnings growth drivers that are delivering now and ramp-up in the near future. Our multiyear productivity push is already delivering bottom line results. Our mantra is one of continuous improvement. We did it in 2015, and we will continue with that same mindset into this year, making even more progress towards our goal of $1 billion in savings over 3 years with 2017 being year 3. We are pleased we exceeded our $300 million productivity target, with a $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015. And in 2016, we have targeted to save an additional -- an incremental greater than $300 million. In fact, we are increasing our headcount reduction target as part of this program by approximately 500 roles, bringing the total program headcount reduction to 2,200 roles that will be eliminated. Thus far, we have reduced just over 1,200 roles. Our strategic investments, including our U.S. Gulf Coast and Sidara projects, will significantly enhance our go forward earnings profile. These projects are based on strong underlying fundamentals that deliver bottom line benefits in all scenarios, because of their low cost position and value add products. We are pleased with the startup of these growth facilities and we expect several additional units to come online, both on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in  Saudi Arabia in 2016. 
Another earnings driver comes from our restructuring on the ownership of Dow Corning, which we expect to close in the middle of this year. This transaction expected to yield more than $1 billion in additional annual EBITDA at full run rate synergies. 
Just all these drivers alone approach $4 billion of EBITDA contribution on a run rate basis. And of course, it's important to remember that we have additional levers in place that will benefit our portfolio depending on how market forces develop through the year. From a cash flow and future earnings potential view, these drivers are indeed powerful. They all bolster our growth profile, expand the potential to serve our customers and release significant value for our shareholders. 
I will now review our 2016 market outlook and priorities for the year. So turning to Slide 21. We will continue to see growth in the 3 key markets in which our materials businesses compete: packaging, transportation and construction. All consumer-driven and innovation-based. These 3 markets have carried the strength that we saw at the end of 2015 into the first month of 2016. The global economy continues to be volatile and we see that trend persisting for the near term. However, we also see strong demand from consumers in the U.S., as well as in China and that plays well to our consumer-driven portfolio, technologies and narrower and deeper market focus. From a macro perspective, we are in and expect to continue to be in oversupplied energy and agriculture markets. We see low energy prices being a net benefit to the consumer. We do not sell energy. What we produce and sell continues to see tight and supply -- and tightening supply/demand dynamics. Our differentiated solutions allow us to drive demand and capture value. 
And turning to the geographies, North America is expected to remain strong, demand in Europe will continue to improve and Latin America will have mixed returns across the region. We also expect continued growth in China, driven by demand for our consumer-targeted solutions. 
And finally, in this volatile macro environment, expect us to control what we can control, expect us to improve our productivity, expect us to control cost and expect us to deliver the growth projects we have in place. 
Turning to Slide 22 and looking ahead, 2016 is primed to be another big year for Dow, and our teams are squarely aligned around 3 clear priorities. 
Priority one, delivering our 2016 plan despite these volatile macro conditions. Here, you can expect us to continue controlling the things we can control: driving our productivity initiatives, realizing the benefits of our commercialized innovation and executing ongoing price volume discipline. We will continue to reduce costs and expand margins. Two, close the Dow Corning transaction by midyear and deliver the related synergies.  And three, move swiftly through the key stage gates of the Dow-DuPont transaction, close MergeCo, realize synergies on an accelerated basis and prep the intended spins. The makeup of the teams and the timeline for the transaction is available in more detail in the appendix using the same slides DuPont provided during their earnings call last week. I reiterate Ed's comments that he made during the call. We are working on an accelerated time frame to close the merger and deliver the synergies and the intended spins. The synergy estimates of $3 billion cost and $1 billion growth are indeed a floor, not a ceiling. 
In sum, you should expect in 2016 the same resolute focus our Dow team has demonstrated over these past several years. And speaking of our Dow team, we also announced this morning that Jim Fitterling has been appointed to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of Dow. Since the announced merger with DuPont, Jim has been and will continue to work closely alongside me in running Dow's operations. He will play a key role in supporting me to drive the successful completion of the merger and unleashing the full value of the 3 intended subsequent independent companies. His appointment is extremely well-deserved and a reflection of his abilities and our commitment to our company over his 30-plus year career. Now we anticipate that the entire process to close the merger and set the companies up to be spun will take about 1.5 years all told. I look forward to working with Jim and also with Howard Ungerleider in the office of the CEO over that time period to bring that entire process to a successful conclusion and enable a successful leadership handover to coordinate with my own planned transition out of the company, which will occur when we are set up to be spun off, but no later than the end of Q2 2017. 
We will continue to drive our strategic agenda and the transformational steps we are undertaking. We will deliver further productivity gains and cost reductions. We will innovate and add value for our customers, and we will drive enhanced returns for our shareholders. And we will deliver this exciting new phase of growth manifested in the creation of Dow-DuPont and its 3 destination companies. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

Look, I think every industrial company, every company out there, is not giving any sort of firmness on any of these years in front of us. That's not new news. I think 2016, 2017, even with an election year here in front of us in the United States, the macros are very difficult to predict. What we are seeing though is very strong trend lines which we set in our core, which I think gives us strong views towards our ability to grow earnings, is this notion that the consumer is active in the United States, and that consumer is becoming increasingly active in China, and then actually, there's the beginnings of good spending in Europe. We do believe low energy price, low oil prices are seeping into the economy, and that's creating a stimulus that actually is of the right kind. And I think if that stimulus continues to be what it is, short of major tectonic events geopolitically, I think the confidence in the real economy will emerge continually from the consumer. And frankly, that is what we're seeing in our results. We're seeing it in our product mix, which we've been working hard to position, to be B2B to C, and I think with Jim talked about packaging and plastics, and I could say the same about anything, elastomers, our water business, our automotive business, we're seeing strong demand in construction chemicals in Western Europe. I think it takes away this notion of back-loading. It takes this notion of 13 quarters in a row continuing that trend. And that then speaks to the other side of it. Most of us scenario plan these days, we don't actually say this is the condition. It's going to be 2.5% GDP and then go from there. None of us do that. We bracket it and then we pivot self-help appropriately. And if we have to go down further in cost base, on productivity actions because markets don't manifest themselves, we take out more costs. And having an IT platform that's leveraged, we can do that pretty quick. We can move the cost structure with demand and price volume manage, and that's what you've seen from us. So look, I think we have confidence in our machine, continuing to deliver and generate this cash."

If we'd started the quarter, we would have thought maybe fourth quarter would've been more dominated by emerging markets and more by developed markets instead of emerging markets. And what we saw, was we saw strong performance in both. And so I think what you're seeing here is the culmination of just a lot of intense focus since about the middle of 2012 around our top line growth.

So we did sell a couple of molecules in the fourth quarter. They were in the range of $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA contribution. So you need to back that out of the segment. But otherwise, that was real productivity that really drove that. You remember, we were one of the first, if not the first, Ag player to do restructuring, and that was part of our announcement earlier in 2015. To your question of whether we can grow EBITDA in 2016, that's going to be a very tough slog on an operating basis, even with productivity considering high channel inventories, low crop prices and just lower overall demand. Remember, we're forecasting we see the market to decline between 3% and 5%. So it's going to be tough. Our focus is continue to deliver the innovations, continue to deliver the growth on the Crop Protection side and the new products on the Seeds side and continue to drive productivity to outpace the competition, and that's our focus."

Obviously, we have some plastics that go into the commodity segments and continue to be strong as well. You'll see a little bit of sales that are going into ethylene to the Olin deal, but that isn't going to be material to the numbers that are in front of you. And the other thing you see on the revenue line is that revenue looks down pretty dramatically.

It's first class. It has incredible technology not just, of course, in trait delivery mechanisms but it's automated, it's technology-rich, it's got capabilities on the climactic side. And what the Dow chemistry brings and the Dow traits bring, especially the combination of traits that we can bring on herbicides and insecticides is a winning hand. As you know, we have the next series of traits coming out in the marketplace. So everyone has always said that this is the greatest combination you could put in the sector, and everything we've seen since the announcement and the work we've done has just doubled down and tripled down. We cannot be more excited. And Indianapolis, in Dow AgroScience, we were down there and the people there were excited because the property's always been a property we've talked about in terms of where its destination might be. There's no secret that Dow never saw itself as the natural owner long-term. But the combination, waiting for it to come the way it did, was a winning hand. And so we will have a lot more to say.

Turning to Slide 6, our results this quarter and in 2015 reflected the benefits of our continued disciplined approach to execute on our priorities. Dow delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of operating EPS and EBITDA margin growth. Operating earnings per share increased 9% to $0.93 per share. Volume increased 4%, which represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. This includes 5% growth in our emerging regions led by greater China, which was up 10%. Operating EBITDA was $2.4 billion. Excluding the impact of divestitures, operating EBITDA rose more than $100 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating EBITDA margins expanded across all segments to 20.9%, the highest quarterly result since the first quarter of 2005. During the quarter, we also returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, with the closing of our Dow Chlorine Products transaction serving as a significant driver of improvements to our capital structure. We've included a full look back on the greater than $4.8 billion in consideration for the transaction in the appendix. And finally, at the very end of December, Dow received $1.5 billion in pretax proceeds through the sale of its direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE. 
Moving to our full year results, Dow reported operating EPS of $3.47 a share, a 12% increase year-over-year. We achieved operating EBITDA of $9.6 billion, a new high. Operating EBITDA margins expanded more than 360 basis points to 19.7%, representing the highest level in more than a decade, with gains reported in all operating segments reflecting our continued discipline and price volume management. Operating return on capital increased to 12.1%, marking 3 consecutive years of expansion. We delivered $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the year, $1 billion increase compared to last year. And on an operating basis, this represents the third consecutive year of record cash flow from operations. 
We also continued to return significant cash to our shareholders. In 2015, we returned $4.6 billion through paid dividends and share repurchases, and we recently announced another increase to our quarterly dividend to a new historic high. Additionally, during the year, we announced a series of portfolio management milestones, which brought our total pretax value from portfolio actions since 2013 to more than $13.5 billion, coming in well ahead of both our committed target and time line. 
Moving on to our dashboard of key financial performance metrics on Slide 7. These highlights reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasingly reward our owners. And as you see here, we've made significant progress against each one. 
In the fourth quarter, we reduced our net debt to cap to 24.8% from 37.3% in the year ago period and well below our 10-year average of 35.9%. Net debt to operating EBITDA declined to 0.9x versus 1.5x in the same quarter last year. And year-over-year, total cash and cash equivalents have increased by $2.9 billion. Further, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through paid dividends and share repurchases, with $1.5 billion related to the equity redemption from the Dow Chlorine Products transaction and an additional $700 million of stock buybacks in the quarter. We exited the year with operating return on capital of 12.1%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. 
Now let's turn to our segment results, starting on Slide 9. Ag Sciences reported sales of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $1.9 billion in the year ago period, impacted by continued lower crop, commodity prices, high channel inventories and ongoing currency headwinds. Operating EBITDA for the segment was essentially flat year-over-year as headwinds from pricing and the divestiture of AgroFresh were offset by the sale of nonstrategic product lines and disciplined productivity actions we drove throughout 2015. Here, we were among the first movers in the industry to take swift action and reduce our cost structure in response to market headwinds. During the year, sales of our new crop protection products grew 6%, and we gained corn market share in the Americas. Looking ahead to 2016, soft commodity prices are expected to continue, with the overall market projected to be down 3% to 5%. 
In this environment, we're focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves with new products as well as continued self-help actions to deliver performance that continues to outpace that of our competitors. 
Consumer Solutions on Slide 10 achieved an all-time quarterly operating EBITDA record of $296 million. This reflects continued demand in the automotive and semiconductor sectors. Collectively, the businesses in this segment drove cost reductions in line with productivity initiatives and realized margin expansion from demand for innovative customer-focused solutions. 
Dow Automotive Systems had another strong quarter, led by demand for our science and engineering capabilities that improve fuel efficiency, safety and acoustic performance. In this business, we're leveraging our technology capabilities to outpace the industry. For example, in North America, we continue to make solid progress with electric vehicle manufacturers where our content per vehicle averages 3x that of nonelectric vehicles. 
In Consumer Care, volume gains in Asia and EMEAI more than offset a transition in the Americas from powder-based detergent solutions to capsules. We also saw double-digit volume growth in targeted pharmaceutical and personal care markets and took action to respond to the weaker industrial markets by closing a less competitive cellulosic facility in West Virginia. 
Dow Electronic Materials expanded EBITDA once again, as Semiconductor and Growth Technologies grew faster than the industry, driven by our technology differentiation that lowered the cost of ownership for advanced nodes. Looking ahead, we see margin improving in our display business, driven by our core knowledge and our strength in LED backlight films. 
Turning to Slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions reported fourth quarter sales of $1.7 billion, down from the year ago period as volume gains in nearly all businesses were more than offset by price pressures from lower raw material costs and currency headwinds. Dow Building & Construction drove margin expansion through strength in construction chemical markets and our FR63 licensing efforts. Dow Coating Materials grew volume, led by industrial coatings. Looking ahead, we expect growth in our coatings business to outpace the market due to the commercial launch of 5 new vinyl acrylic binders. Performance Monomers remains in an ongoing global trough, and we are taking several actions: shutting down 20% of our Deer Park acrylate capacity to reduce our merchant exposure, optimizing our turnaround and structural costs and continuing to explore coproducer supply agreements. In Energy & Water Solutions, our industry-leading reverse osmosis business saw double-digit growth driven by strong demand. During the quarter, our new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia also came online and will serve the growing need for water in the Middle East. Based on the market penetration and customer acceptance of our product, we expect to reach capacity on this asset very quickly. 
Turning to Performance Materials & Chemicals. Fourth quarter sales were down on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by the impact of the split off of Dow Chlorine Products and other divestitures as well as significant price and currency headwinds. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline as growth in ethylene glycol sales was more than offset by weakness in the energy sector, along with the change in long-term supply arrangement. Our price volume management kept EBITDA flat in our core business, but that was offset by weakness in MEG pricing as well as increased Sadara expenses as the site continues to progress startup of the new production units which drove down equity earnings. We reported another strong quarter in Polyurethanes as a result of self-help measures and a shift to a more specialized system house sales approach which achieved double-digit sales growth. Additionally, our new polyols facility in Thailand drove share gains and double-digit volume increases in Asia. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our Performance Plastics segment delivered a fourth quarter operating EBITDA record of $1.3 billion driven by steady demand in all businesses and margin expansion in most geographic areas. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics sold a quarterly record polyethylene volume, led primarily by double-digit gains in Asia and strong demand for Dow's innovative packaging solutions. In early December, the first polyethylene units began production at our Sadara joint venture and first shipments have already been received by our customers. Dow Elastomers reported double-digit growth in North America on continued customer demand for Dow products in the transportation and infrastructure sectors. Our INFUSE elastomers, which are sold into higher end footwear, saw strong volumes in the quarter. Additionally, an increase in consumer preference for SUVs resulted in higher per vehicle elastomer demand. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications saw double-digit operating EBITDA growth as well. 
This quarter's business performance continues to be underpinned by ongoing progress in our integration and feedstock flexibility. For example, Dow Europe produced almost half of its ethylene in 2015 from LPG, and we increased our European LPG cracking capability to over 60%. Some additional details on this topic are also in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me briefly cover our modeling guidance for the quarter and for 2016. On a year-over-year basis in 2016, we will have earnings catalysts from a full year of PDH impact and we have 2 positive drivers that will contribute to the back half of the year, the Dow Corning transaction and our enhancements to ethane cracking capabilities in Louisiana. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we will make further progress on our productivity initiatives that build on the $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015 by targeting an additional and incremental $300 million in 2016. We also see pension expense providing an approximately $250 million tailwind as well. We do see several headwinds, namely continued pressure from currency, the loss of earnings due to divestitures and soft ag fundamentals from continued lower crop prices and higher channel inventories. Specifically in the first quarter, we see demand fundamentals that continue to favor volume expansion in our targeted sectors. This will be tempered by higher turnaround activity on a sequential basis as well as lost earnings from our recent portfolio management actions. Finally, we will continue to drive our $5 billion share repurchase program forward. We expect to deliver $2 billion of share repurchases this year as our purchasing window likely opens up following the shareholder vote for the Dow-DuPont transaction. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew."

If you look at Slide 16, you'll see that 2015 in every regard was a transformative year for Dow. We delivered record results amidst an ever-challenging macro environment, with 13 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition to the financial highlights that Howard just reviewed, we made further progress on our productivity goals through harmonizing our work processes, streamlining functional business support and optimizing our asset footprint. We committed to achieve $300 million in 2015, and in fact, we over-delivered on this goal with $345 million realized. We completed the first full year operating on Dow's new one instance IT platform. This world-class system represented the single largest implementation of SAP, and it is already delivering significant streamlining benefits while also enabling sharper business and geographic insights. 
We're delivering on our significant growth project milestones, celebrating first polyethylene product shipped from our Sadara joint venture and starting up the world's largest on-purpose propylene facility which is making smooth and steady progress towards full rates. And importantly, in a year with these significant operational projects coming online, we delivered our best-ever EH&S performance. 
And last, but certainly not least, 2015 was a truly transformative year on the strategic front. We drove major actions on our joint ventures, with the sale of our direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE, the step acquisition of Univation Technologies and the announced restructuring of the ownership of Dow Corning Silicones business. We split off Dow Chlorine Products and released further value through our transactions of the AgroFresh, Sodium Borohydride and Angus businesses. And of course, in December, we announced the signing of a historic transaction with DuPont and the intent to create 3 focused industry leaders in agriculture, material science and specialty products, releasing tremendous value for our owners. I'll have more to say about our progress here in just a moment. 
If we turn to Slide 17, in summary, 2015 represents the culmination of actions we have taken over a 3-year period to increase cash flow generation, drive self-help measures, enhance the quality of our portfolio, capture growth for the future and increasingly reward our shareholders. 2015 will go down as the most significant year in Dow's storied history, and quarter 4, the exclamation mark on the year. This direction was set by the thorough review the Dow board and executive team launched in 2013 to identify clear actions to unlock additional value for our shareholders. As part of that review, we set very focused goals, including to grow EPS by 10% per year over the long-term; to enhance our traditional EVA focus; to continue to reduce our debt; and to go narrower and deeper in key end markets and divest noncore businesses including Dow's exiting chlorine, our original foundational product; all with a relentless focus on shareholder value creation and long-term growth. We have made significant progress against this strategic road map, and these actions have delivered impressive financial results and returns to our owners over that 3-year period, including $22 billion in cash flow from operations; ROC improvement of 450 basis points, from 7.6% to 12.1%; more than $8 billion reduction in net debt; and most importantly, $12 billion distributed through share repurchases and paid dividends. 
Turning to Slide 18. These results are also underpinned by our intense focus in driving an EVA culture and performance using a best owner mindset as our key lens and taking actions on multiple  fronts: lowering our working capital and asset base through our multiyear productivity actions, most recently our Dow 10.0 streamlining program and our aforementioned world-class IT capabilities; driving synergies through our corporate base, further leveraging our functional expertise across the enterprise to increase sales, optimizing purchasing and driving a lean corporate center and regional hubs; capturing growth where growth exists via cross-selling opportunities, maximizing our operating leverage and improving our sales mix. As a result, over these past 3 years, our EVA improvement has been significant, placing us in the 95th percentile relative to our peers. 
Turning to Slide 19. To keep this momentum going and build on the performance and portfolio actions of the past 3 years, we put in place clear earnings growth drivers that are delivering now and ramp-up in the near future. Our multiyear productivity push is already delivering bottom line results. Our mantra is one of continuous improvement. We did it in 2015, and we will continue with that same mindset into this year, making even more progress towards our goal of $1 billion in savings over 3 years with 2017 being year 3. We are pleased we exceeded our $300 million productivity target, with a $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015. And in 2016, we have targeted to save an additional -- an incremental greater than $300 million. In fact, we're increasing our headcount reduction target as part of this program by approximately 500 roles, bringing the total program headcount reduction to 2,200 roles that will be eliminated. Thus far, we have reduced just over 1,200 roles. Our strategic investments, including our U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara projects, will significantly enhance our go forward earnings profile. These projects are based on strong underlying fundamentals. They deliver bottom line benefits in all scenarios, because of their low cost position and value add products. We are pleased with the startup of these growth facilities, and we expect several additional units to come online, both on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in  Saudi Arabia in 2016. 
Another earnings driver comes from our restructuring on the ownership of Dow Corning, which we expect to close in the middle of this year. This transaction expected to yield more than $1 billion in additional annual EBITDA at full run rate synergies. 
Just all these drivers alone approach $4 billion of EBITDA contribution on a run rate basis. And of course, it's important to remember that we have additional levers in place that will benefit our portfolio depending on how market forces develop through the year. From a cash flow and future earnings potential view, these drivers are indeed powerful. They all bolster our growth profile, expand the potential to serve our customers and release significant value for our shareholders. 
I will now review our 2016 market outlook and priorities for the year. So turning to Slide 21. We will continue to see growth in the 3 key markets in which our materials businesses compete: packaging, transportation and construction; all consumer-driven and innovation-based. These 3 markets have carried the strength that we saw at the end of 2015 into the first month of 2016. The global economy continues to be volatile and we see that trend persisting for the near term. However, we also see strong demand from consumers in the U.S., as well as in China, and that plays well to our consumer-driven portfolio, technologies and narrower and deeper market focus. From a macro perspective, we are in and expect to continue to be in oversupplied energy and agriculture markets. We see low energy prices being a net benefit to the consumer. We do not sell energy. What we produce and sell continues to see tight and supply -- and tightening supply-demand dynamics. Our differentiated solutions allow us to drive demand and capture value. 
And turning to the geographies. North America is expected to remain strong. Demand in Europe will continue to improve, and Latin America will have mixed returns across the region. We also expect continued growth in China, driven by demand for our consumer-targeted solutions. 
And finally, in this volatile macro environment, expect us to control what we can control. Expect us to improve our productivity. Expect us to control cost, and expect us to deliver the growth projects we have in place. 
Turning to Slide 22 and looking ahead, 2016 is primed to be another big year for Dow, and our teams are squarely aligned around 3 clear priorities. 
Priority one, deliver our 2016 plan despite these volatile macro conditions. Here, you can expect us to continue controlling the things we can control: driving our productivity initiatives, realizing the benefits of our commercialized innovation and executing ongoing price volume discipline. We will continue to reduce costs and expand margins. Two, close the Dow Corning transaction by midyear and deliver the related synergies.  And three, move swiftly through the key stage gates of the Dow-DuPont transaction: close MergeCo, realize synergies on an accelerated basis and prep the intended spins. The makeup of the teams and the time line for the transaction is available in more detail in the appendix using the same slides DuPont provided during their earnings call last week. I reiterate Ed's comments that he made during the call. We are working on an accelerated time frame to close the merger and deliver the synergies and the intended spins. The synergy estimates of $3 billion cost and $1 billion growth are indeed a floor, not a ceiling. 
In sum, you should expect in 2016 the same resolute focus our Dow team has demonstrated over these past several years. And speaking of our Dow team, we also announced this morning that Jim Fitterling has been appointed to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of Dow. Since the announced merger with DuPont, Jim has been and will continue to work closely alongside me in running Dow's operations. He will play a key role in supporting me to drive the successful completion of the merger and unleashing the full value of the 3 intended subsequent independent companies. His appointment is extremely well-deserved and a reflection of his abilities and our commitment to our company over his 30-plus year career. Now we anticipate that the entire process to close the merger and set the companies up to be spun will take about 1.5 years all told. I look forward to working with Jim and also with Howard Ungerleider in the office of the CEO over that time period to bring that entire process to a successful conclusion and enable a successful leadership handover to coordinate with my own planned transition out of the company, which will occur when we are set up to be spun off, but no later than the end of Q2 2017. 
We will continue to drive our strategic agenda and the transformational steps we are undertaking. We will deliver further productivity gains and cost reductions. We will innovate and add value for our customers, and we will drive enhanced returns for our shareholders. And we will deliver this exciting new phase of growth manifested in the creation of Dow-DuPont and its 3 destination companies. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

You've got 3 big players, ourselves, CPChem and Exxon that are coming and a small crack with Oxychem. That is our view as the first wave of capacity that's coming on. That is quite a bit ahead of anybody else. And those were the first ones out of the ground and are going to continue to be the ones you see in the first wave. When the second wave comes is anybody's guess at this point. Some people are saying '18. I think it might even slide into '19 or '20.

Look, I think every industrial company, every company out there, is not giving any sort of firmness on any of these years in front of us. That's not new news. I think 2016, 2017, even with an election year here in front of us in the United States, the macros are very difficult to predict. What we are seeing though is very strong trend lines which we said in our call, which I think gives us strong views towards our ability to grow earnings, is this notion that the consumer is active in the United States, and that consumer is becoming increasingly active in China, and that actually, there's the beginnings of good spending in Europe. We do believe low energy price, low oil prices are seeping into the economy, and that's creating a stimulus that actually is of the right kind. And I think if that stimulus continues to be what it is, short of major tectonic events geopolitically, I think the confidence in the real economy will emerge continually from the consumer. And frankly, that is what we're seeing in our results. We're seeing it in our product mix, which we've been working hard to position, to be B2B to C, and I think with Jim talked about packaging and plastics, and I could say the same about anything, elastomers, our water business, our automotive business. We're seeing strong demand in construction chemicals in Western Europe. I think it takes away this notion of back-loading. It takes this notion of 13 quarters in a row of continuing that trend. And that then speaks to the other side of it. Most of our scenario plan these days, we don't actually say this is the condition. It's going to be 2.5% GDP and then go from there. None of us do that. We bracket it and then we pivot self-help appropriately. And if we have to go down further in cost base, on productivity actions because markets don't manifest themselves, we take out more costs. And having an IT platform that's leveraged, we can do that pretty quick. We can move the cost structure with demand and price volume manage, and that's what you've seen from us.

They're very targeted on which geographies we want to grow in. If we'd started the quarter, we would have thought maybe fourth quarter would've been more dominated by emerging markets and more by developed markets instead of emerging markets. And what we saw was we saw strong performance in both. And so I think what you're seeing here is the culmination of just a lot of intense focus since about the middle of 2012 around our top line growth.

To your question of whether we can grow EBITDA in 2016, that's going to be a very tough slog on an operating basis, even with productivity considering that high channel inventories, low crop prices and just lower overall demand. Remember, we're forecasting we see the market to decline between 3% and 5%. So it's going to be tough. Our focus is to continue to deliver the innovations, continue to deliver the growth on the Crop Protection side and the new products on the Seeds side and continue to drive productivity to outpace the competition, and that's our focus."

I think if you look at our Performance Plastics segment, you also have to bear in mind that we have capacities that have come in there on the Elastomers business, which is a high-value, high-margin business which has much more resilience in pricing, and also a lot targeted towards automotive and other consumer goods and high-end manufacturing. When you look at plastics business per se, a very large part of it is predominantly food and specialty packaging, and that business has continued to grow strong around the world. Obviously, we have some plastics that go into the commodity segments and that continue to be strong as well. You'll see a little bit of sales that are going into ethylene to the Olin deal, but that isn't going to be material to the numbers that are in front of you. And the other thing you see on the revenue line is that revenue looks down pretty dramatically. But when you peel back the byproduct sales off the crackers, which are hydrocarbon and energy-type of byproducts that have moved with oil more on a one-to-one relationship, plastics has held up really well based on volume demand in the end markets, and we think that's going to continue."

The mixed-feed cracker is going to be coming up and another couple of polyethylene units throughout 2016. But in PMC, Performance Materials & Chemicals, you're looking at about $100 million, $200 million headwind because they're in the really steep part of the S curve as their assets are being built and finalized in 2016. We've got some capacity for PMC not coming on until really the back half of the year. We still have a view that our long-term average is $500 million split between equity earnings and the commission structure that we're going to get as we are marketing the product for Sadara outside of the Middle East zone. That's a long-term average, and that is after the whole complex has started up. So that would start to hit those numbers in the post-2018, 2019 time frame.

All I can say, Chris, is that the last several weeks of team discussions have just amplified or magnified the original preannouncement of the merger work that was done by the teams. We had over 4,000 man hours of combination work in the Ag teams. The 2 Ag teams were on fire in terms of complementarity. I mean, the absolute hand in glove combination of what we have now seen, Jim and Howard and I have done a trip out to Des Moines, to Johnston and seen the Pioneer capability up-close and personal. It's first class. It has incredible technology not just, of course, in trait delivery mechanisms but it's automated. It's technology-rich. It's got capabilities on the climatic side. And what the Dow chemistry brings and the Dow traits bring, especially the combination of traits that we can bring on herbicides and insecticides, is a winning hand. As you know, we have the next series of traits coming out in the marketplace. So everyone has always said that this is the greatest combination you could put in the sector, and everything we've seen since the announcement and the work we've done has just doubled down and tripled down. We cannot be more excited. And Indianapolis, in Dow AgroScience, we were down there and the people there were excited. Because the property's always been a property we've talked about in terms of where its destination might be. There's no secret that Dow never saw itself as the natural owner long term. But the combination, waiting for it to come the way it did, was a winning hand. And so we'll have a lot more to say. There are some holes in the repertoire that we'll have to address. But I can't wait till the merger occurs and this company is set up for them to identify how they're going to grow with this complementarity."

The Dow team is clearly building momentum as we head toward our historic Dow Corning and DowDuPont transactions. Simply put, our strategy is working, yet again underscoring the power of our differentiation and integration, coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda and disciplined productivity mindset. The strength of our businesses and our unique business model was on full display as our integrated value add specialty businesses and broad geographic footprint enabled us to outperform versus our more narrowly focused competitors despite lower hydrocarbon and crop price environments. I am very proud of the team's achievements and their relentless focus on action with self-help actions on productivity, variable margin management and targeted growth driving our agenda. We, have, and will continue to run our businesses to maximize value our customers and returns for our shareholders. As you can see that on our results. 14 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and EBITDA margin expansion; 10 consecutive quarters of volume growth; the highest production volume quarter in our history; and we delivered value for those additional pounds as disciplined margin management enabled the highest EBITDA margin in more than a decade. Importantly, on a trailing 12 month basis, this translated to an expansion on both ROC and EVA. These results have enabled us to increasingly reward our shareholders as we paid our highest regular quarterly dividend in our history of $0.46 per share.

Turning to Slide 6, our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world with",1775,"Thank you, Andrew, good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world with North America up 6%; Europe, Middle East, Africa and India up 4%; and Asia Pacific up 3%. This more than offset a decline in Latin America, down 4%. Emerging geographies also continued to grow, with India up 13% and Greater China up 5%, reflecting continued consumer-driven demand. Overall, price was down 12% primarily due to lower price declines of which the largest contributor was the Hydrocarbons business and ongoing global currency headwinds. However, it's important to note that our ongoing margin management more than offset these declines, enabling operating EBITDA margin expansion to 21%, with some of the strongest gains in our downstream innovation-focused businesses and consumer solutions and Infrastructure Solutions.  Operating EBITDA was $2.3 billion, with notable strength in our transportation, infrastructure and electronic end markets, plus an all-time record in Consumer Solutions and a first quarter record in Performance Plastics, which were more than offset by the impact of lower equity earnings and divestitures. 
Moving on to our dashboard of key financial metrics on Slide 7, which reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital; driving 10% EPS growth over the long-term; maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility; and continuing to increasingly reward shareholders. And as you see here, over the last 3 years, we've made steady progress against each one. 
Now I'll turn to our segment results on Slide 8 starting with Ag. Agricultural Sciences operating EBITDA was nearly flat, with EBITDA margin up 250 basis points. The result exemplifies our self-help mindset as disciplined productivity essentially offset the impact of challenging market conditions and currency headwinds. We also reached further milestones in our innovation agenda. In the ENLIST program, we launched cotton in U.S., in Crop Protection, the business progressed its investments in support of launches from its product pipeline for novel herbicides such Arylex and Rinskor and Inatreq fungicide. Looking ahead, we maintain our view that the market will be down 3% to 5% this year as we expect high yields in the Americas, high channel inventories, ongoing currency headwinds and low crop prices. While it may be too early to call the bottom, we are encouraged to see corn and soybean pricing rise from recent lows and long-term the world continues to meet solutions that will drive greater ag productivity. 
Turning now to Consumer Solutions on Slide 9, this segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record and margin expanded 400 basis points, reflecting robust demand for Dow's innovative product portfolios in the automotive and the semiconductor sectors. Dow Automotive systems achieved volume gains on above market demand for solutions enabling light-weighting and sound dampening performance. The business launched a new BETAMATE solution for structural impact performance, as well as technologies for advanced floor protection solutions. In Electronic Materials, despite a decline in demand for applications tied to personal computer components, we benefited from new business wins for semiconductor and Display Technologies. 
For Infrastructure Solutions, on Slide 10, EBITDA was essentially flat despite lower equity earnings and margin expanded 220 basis points. Dow Building & Construction delivered double-digit volume growth, with increases across all geographic areas on strong demand for our construction chemicals portfolio and STYROFOAM insulation. Hereto, our innovations are delivering as we saw continued adoption of the FR63 flame retardant technology, as well as progress with our INSTA STIK roofing adhesives and our Liquid Armor flashing and sealants. Energy & Water Solutions continue to be impacted by headwinds in oil and gas exploration. During the quarter, our Water business reached a milestone as its new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia sold its first production. This facility is targeted to meet demand the emerging world for Dow separation technologies. I'm pleased to report that the site is already delivering our differentiated value-added products and is operating at similar rates and yield as our state-of-the-art operation in Minnesota. Performance Monomers profitability improved, partly due to the business' decision to reduce its merchant sales exposure. And in Dow Coating Materials, the business grew volume due to improvements in industrial and architectural coating sectors, benefiting from a strategy that broaden Dow's participation in these end markets. The business continued to broaden its product portfolio, launching 5 new vinyl acrylic binders. In equity earnings, Dow Corning's silicones delivered a double-digit earnings increase on strong volume growth. 
On Slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals increased volumes in most businesses. Polyurethanes delivered a double-digit volume increase on demand for house obligations and specialty polyols as the business continued to shift its mix into higher value offerings. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline despite strength in the durables markets on a weaker de-icer demand due to a milder winter. We also saw notable decline in our equity earnings in the segment, consistent with our modeling guidance from the ramp-up of Sadara spending, a change in ownership of MEGlobal and lower energy prices. 
Performance Plastics on Slide 12 delivered a record first quarter operating EBITDA with volume gains across all businesses. Packaging and specialty plastics achieved a new record polyethylene sales volume in the quarter, driven by operational reliability and robust demand for its differentiated products. The business continued to advance its innovation agenda with new launches in several new product families, including agility for food packaging, INFUSE for health and hygiene, and INNATE for industrial and consumer packaging. Gains were achieved in most geographic areas led by North America and Asia Pacific with double-digit growth in China. Earnings grew in our Thai JVs on stronger Asian naphtha chain margins. These results were more than offset by a greater than $100 million headwind in Argentina due to our facility outage and the reduction of import barriers. Elastomers delivered energy growth on higher demand for its differentiated technologies that enhanced the customer experience in transportation and high-performance athletic footwear. And electrical and telecommunications achieved double-digit volume growth on demand for Infrastructure projects, subsea cable and fiberoptics. 
Turning to our second quarter and full year modeling guidance on Slide 13, in the second quarter, we do expect a seasonal uptick in Infrastructure which lifts our Building & Construction, coatings and electrical and telecommunications businesses. In Performance Plastics, we expect year-over-year margin compression in Europe as well as reduced earnings from our position in Latin America. In Ag, we expect the market headwinds to persist. However, with our continued self-help actions, we expect the first half of 2016 to be comparable to the same period in 2015 when adjusted for the impact of divestitures. In 2016, we continue to bring on several earnings growth catalysts, starting with the PDH contribution, which will continue to build throughout the year. The startup of new units of Sadara will also continue. In fact, the second Solution Polyethylene train came online this month. Turnarounds and maintenance spending will be higher sequentially in the second quarter by $100 million to $150 million. We expect lower equity earnings to continue as a result of our portfolio actions and the Sadara unit startups. Turnarounds and equity earnings headwinds in the second quarter will primarily impact Performance Materials & Chemicals, and that will subside in the back half of the year. The Dow Corning transaction is expected to be a tailwind in the second half of the year, and we will benefit from ethane cracking enhancements in Louisiana toward the end of the year. We also see pension expense continuing to provide a tailwind. As we look ahead, we expect our operating tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the range of 23% to 27%. We expect our reported rate to fall in the 7% to 12% range in the second quarter, assuming a successful Dow Corning close. 
I'll wrap up my comments this morning with an update on the Dow Corning transaction on Slide 15. We have made significant progress toward the integration and will hit the ground running immediately following close. In the first quarter of the transaction received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS, and we have made steady progress on the regulatory front, with approval from several key jurisdictions, including China, Japan and the EU. Joint integration teams composed of Dow and Dow Corning leaders have been working together since the first of the year to set the foundation for a successful integration. With an eye toward our post- close priorities, we established the business and the organizational structure that will lead Dow Corning in the future. The team is aligned to 3 areas of focus: Delivery of the 2016 plan and the market and technology based growth on our key sectors such as infrastructure, transportation and consumer care; productivity and asset management, as well as the seamless integration and realization of our cost synergies. 
I want to take a moment to talk about cost synergies and the work the team has accomplished to date which you'll see on Slide 16. As we said in December, this transaction provides Dow an opportunity to own all of the silicones business and secure enhanced cost and growth synergies that are unique to Dow as the owner. Dow Corning Silicones is a successful and thriving business that Dow helped build over the last 70-plus years. This transaction enhances our market-facing businesses with a high-quality Silicones franchise and provides a catalyst for growth. It allows Dow to accelerate our narrower and deeper focus on our key value chains, including transportation, Infrastructure, Consumer Care and electronics. Because we know the business so well, there is a tremendous value in the synergy capture, and here, Dow is uniquely positioned to access quick wins. The $300 million of cost synergies will focus on back-office and operational efficiencies, and we expect to achieve 100% run rate within 24 months after closing. You see here our latest estimate of how this will develop. We expect to deliver a 65% target run rate within 12 months. The team has now completed their work to validate our cost synergy target and their findings give me great confidence that we will hit our commitment. In total, we still see this transaction adding more than $1 billion in additional EBITDA for Dow On a full year basis posts synergy capture. It will also be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year 1. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim"

We continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. Here, you see our updated time line. All key deliverables remain",1068,"Thank you, Howard. Turning now to Slide 17. We continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. Here, you see our updated time line. All key deliverables remain on track. A major milestone in the quarter was the filing of the Form S-4 registration statement, and just last week, we followed up with the First Amendment. We continue to expect the S-4 will be effective in the second quarter. Following that, both Dow and DuPont will set the date for our respective special meetings for shareholders to vote on the merger. The second major milestone in the quarter was our formation of a joint implementation management office or joint IMO, which is driving the integration process across the 2 companies. And the third milestone was both companies jointly engaging McKinsey, who assisted many other companies through a large successful integration. 
Turning to Slide 18, with oversight from the joint executive steering committee, the joint IMO is developing execution-ready plans to ensure that we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as 3 independent divisions as soon as possible post-close. The clear objective of the joint IMO, which Rick Olson from DuPont and I co-lead is speed of execution, speed to close, speed to capture the synergies and speed to spin. The team is squarely focused on that mission. Soon after forming the joint IMO, we commissioned multiple subteams focused on the diversity of work streams from governance to stand up and separation activities, to sourcing and purchasing. There have already been numerous joint planning meetings between the 2 companies. Plans are progressing well, and we continue to make significant progress to realize the vision for the merger and the subsequent intended spins. One of the key deliverables for this team is an execution-ready playbook to achieve our greater than $3 billion synergy target. In this space, we've already done considerable benchmarking to validate our targets. We followed a rigorous process coordinated by McKinsey to provide objectivity and external validation for our assumptions. We compared various financial metrics for the intended spins against best-in-class peers. We did this across businesses and functions. This independent benchmarking yielded a similar answer as the joint working session our companies held prior to announcing the merger. This is just one of the reasons why we feel even more confident in the target and the opportunity in front of us. 
We're equally excited about our near-term earnings growth for drivers which are on Slide 20. In March, our PDH Plant successfully completed the performance test and achieved full run rates less than 2 months after start up. The unit recently went down for plant maintenance and will begin ramping back up next week. We made significant progress on the construction of our Louisiana flexibility project, which is now 95% complete. And in Texas, our Texas 9 cracker is 50% complete with more than 80% of the equipment installed. In Saudi Arabia, we have started our second polyethylene plant on purchased ethylene and have proven several of the major cracker components. We continue to move forward with the startup of this impressive site and expect those activities to accelerate as we proceed through the year. And our multi-year productivity push continues to deliver bottom line results. 
Let's now take a moment to discuss our outlook for the plastics and feedstocks markets, starting with polyethylene on Slide 21. Some are projecting much looser balances for the second half of the year and into next year. The main point of this agreement that we have with consultant projections is the speed in which new U.S. projects are brought online, as well as assumptions about projects in Asia and the Middle East, which we find overly optimistic. If you look at history, you will see that industry supply projections are almost always higher than what is achieved, due to project cancellations, construction delays and labor constraint. For example, in 2007, supply projections for 2012 were about 6 world-scale ethylene crackers higher than what became reality. The general degree on the demand projections in these scenarios, which rest on sustainable urbanization in the developing world. 10 years ago, China's per capita use of polyethylene was roughly 1/5 of the United States. Today, it's half, and this trend will continue. Our view is highlighted in the chart on the right. If you overlay more realistic assumptions about the ability of the industry to bring new facilities online, we see sustainably high rates of ethylene and polyethylene utilization for the next several years. 
In this environment, we believe that lasting value creation comes from participating in the entire plastics value chain, as outlined on Slide 22. The dynamics across the chain can shift significantly over time. The long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, geographic diversification, innovation and differentiation. No one rivals Dow on this front, and our results have shown this time and time again. First, we believe the value of our advantaged feedstock positions will grow. Feedstock flexibility remains one of our signature advantages of Dow's cracker fleet. This, combined with our European LPG capabilities and U.S. PDH, form structural hedges for the exposure to frac spread pressures. And we continue to see ethane and propane balances being favorable for some time. We have given our updated outlooks for these in the appendix. Bottom line, our view hasn't changed. We see plenty of NGLs available for the new crackers based on continued growth and gas demand. Second, European and Asian naphtha cracker margins will continue to reflect tight conditions as underlying demand surpasses realized supply while the U.S. ethylene balance will be somewhat looser. Third, polyethylene over ethylene margins are likely to remain solid as polyethylene capacity additions lag ethylene expansions, especially in the U.S. The key point here is that its consumer demand that drives the market balances. And finally, the value of Dow's differentiation should grow. We've proven the value of our customer intimacy and our differentiated portfolio time and again. We are the innovator for the packaging, elastomers and electrical and telecommunications industries, and that, coupled with our new capacities in Sadara and the U.S. Gulf Coast, drives growth and advantaged results. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew"

In short, we expect to see continued consumer-driven demand around much of the world. We see strong demand signals in North America, gradual recovery in Europe and ongoing consumer -- ed demand growth in China, all of which are driving the need for Dow's unique products, underscoring our innovation, market access and integration, enabling us to deliver value in our selected market sectors. We saw this in the quarter in the performance of our Building & Construction, elastomers, automotive and electronic materials businesses where our smart sized scale enabled us to produce high margin, technology-rich solutions faster and to commercialize them more quickly in the key sectors these businesses serve and grow faster than smaller sized competitors. We believe that pockets of volatility will persist, including near-term geopolitical and economic uncertainty, most notably in Brazil. Supply surpluses will continue in agriculture and energy. This outlook is what we've seen these last many years, and we expect slow economic growth and high volatility to continue in the near term. Going forward, we will continue managing what we can control. We've shown we can grow earnings and volume in this environment, using a narrower and deeper market focus, targeted innovation and our exceptional low cost and integrated position in the value chain. The Dow business model has outperformed its peers in the last several years. Despite a mixed market outlook, we believe we can continue to do so. 
If you turn to Slide 25, I'll end the call today by reiterating that we remain squarely aligned around 3 clear priorities this year. Priority one: Deliver our 2016 plan. As the quarter showed, we are delivering and will continue to do so. Priority two, close the Dow Corning transaction. As Howard said, we are ready to implement and have clear targets in place to meet or exceed expectations. And priority three, move swiftly to the key steps of the DowDuPont transaction. As you heard from Jim, we are on track and will continue to see the $3 billion in projected cost synergies as the floor. And we are driven by the mantra, speed to close, speed to spin. Our team has clear goals in our resolute focus on achieving them. Our unique combination of differentiation and integration, coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda is delivering results. Our broad geographic footprint and relentless productivity mindset will serve us well in the face of volatility and regional and market headwinds. The Dow team is building momentum towards the integration of the Dow Corning silicones business, the creation of DowDuPont and the ultimate creation of the new materials co, to be renamed Dow, a growth company with a winning portfolio. These once-in-a-generation transactions, further bolstered by our near-term drivers and our relentless focus on execution will enable new levels of value creation for our customers and generate even greater returns for our shareholders. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

A couple of quick ones on that. You obviously outlined your views on NGLs. So if you could just tell us what sort of -- within those views of NGL pricing, what sort of natural gas and crude oil pricing assumptions do you have? So that's one part of it. And the second part is that, in my mind, obviously, part of the continued strength within Performance Plastics was low NGL prices but the other part was a rebound in ethylene prices. So could you also tell us who right now is setting the price for ethylene? Is it MTO?"

We believe the gas is going to be very well-supplied over this 5-year horizon, and I think in most cases, gas remains some [ph] $3, maybe it runs between $3 and $4, depending on where oil price goes. In our view, is that $50 to $60 a barrel oil, the NGL supply is going to expand significantly in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. So when you combine that with the fact that the cracker's completion schedule in the RTO horizon is stretching out, and that spreads that NGL demand intensity out, and that's reflected in what we put in the appendix. Ethane export starts out this year, but that growth is slow, and propane competition right now is acting as a cracker, as a ceiling for the prices at the cracker level. In fact, it's back into the slate. If you look at first quarter, ethane and propane were kind of in an even trade off in the cracker slate. So we think the outlook for NGLs for all these projects is going to be just fine and will continue to have a favorable balance there, and you'll see that in the oil and gas ratios as well. As far as ethylene, ethylene moved up $0.05 in March, and I think a little bit of that is some bounce back in volume demand, as you could see from our own results. Volume growth is good there and you also see some impacts of different outages around the world, some planned, some unplanned. Look, I'm not a believer yet in this whole theory that MTO is setting the pricing out there. I think demand is setting the price and MTO may be a factor in some commodity grades of ethylene, polyethylene in China. But for most of the marketplace, I think you've also got a very, very competitive U.S. Gulf Coast situation that's helped setting that price."

And they will also got some commodity price pressures in some parts of the chain, mostly in high signings right now. And in Industrial Solutions, Howard mentioned that we actually, with the step down on MEGlobal and also the lower MEG prices, that hits Industrial Solutions earnings. So if you look about Industrial Solutions, how they did year-over-year, that's carrying. That step down in MEGlobal and MDG prices, and also de-icing season that was 50% lighter than it was last year and the weight of oil and gas sectors. Some of the EO derivatives go into the oil and gas sector and they're carrying that. So I think that explains really most of our own performance. On peer comparisons, you have to adjust for 1x and portfolio differences, so divestiture sales and then the portfolio difference. Some of our peers are heavy into polypropylene and of course, we don't plan that space. When you take those things out and put it on an apples-to-apples basis, I think you'll see that it's a slight beat there."

I'll start and I'll let Jim and Howard. Look, just being on both Europe and Asia, specifically Japan and China, I would tell you the low oil price phenomenon is seeping through the consumer economy in both places, actually as oil importers, and that's been a sustained trend now for several quarters. You see consumption increase. Double down on the products that we supply, some of the very specialty products that we have downstream, these are products that the Chinas and the Europes need, whether they be likely material for costs or whether they be building insulation for energy-efficient buildings. On and on, our innovation agenda is working in those economies. So we're seeing sustainable volumes because we can actually sell out assets, and sell up asset. And as that combination, Jim had it on slide, I think 22, that shows we can make money at different parts of, in his particular case, he referenced the plastics business. And we think that's detaching itself from that oil number quite substantially. In fact, Frankl, you've seen our 14 quarters in a row and 10 quarters in a row volume increase. If you see how that volume increase is made up, it's mixed and it's mix under if you look at extremes of oil price, we've had oil prices as high as 120 in that full year period and oil prices as low as the high 20s in that same period. Yet we've grown volume through sustained execution of products people need. So it's not an inventory readjustment that you're noticing in our results. Jim, do you want to follow up?"

You haven't seen much new cracker capacity come back. You've seen a little bit come back to support Shell. Obviously, Porta Megera came back up to support Shell. The other thing is the shift towards LPG cracking on our side, we've shifted to a very high percent of LPG cracking, and we continue to look at opportunities to make small incremental investments to expand that. And that flexibility has helped us out tremendously. So I don't see that's going to stop. So I think Europe has got a pretty good handle, now in particular. But in general, in the industry it has a pretty good handle on how it's adjusting itself to a changing world."

We're off to a strong start to the year which is continuing the 3.5 year streak of earnings growth, managing all sorts of environment. That's coming because we firstly have targeted growth, and the portfolio is built for this environment. The diversification works and frankly we're finding growth where growth is, and we're seeing great numbers coming out of our various regions, then use markets whether it be China, here in the U.S. or even Europe. We're benefiting from strong margin management and a strong focus on ROC. And then that's the next point I want to make. The U.S. and Chinese markets are strong markets and we have strong outlooks there. We can continue to grow margin in those markets under these environments because we do have the product mix, and that last question on Europe means we have the feedstock to keep making margins in a recovering Europe. U.S., Europe and China being strong for us is something we've now seen for a while and is continuing to build momentum. And then the 2 transactions, both Howard and Jim outlined and the questions were asked on the transactions. We are moving towards these transactions becoming a reality, and we're planning very strongly to execute the synergies and execute them and lean into them and execute them quickly and execute them so in the case of the DowDuPont transaction, we move to the spins as fast as we can in the case of Dow Corning transaction, so that we integrate. Howard's numbers of $300 million of cost synergies, $100 million of growth, just a reminder it's about 8% of revenue. We did double digit percentage revenues on synergies on both carbide and Rohm & Haas, so we have a strong record of executing the synergy targets that we will talk about. We'll have a lot more to say at DowDuPont and the specifics on that and ensuing calls as we go towards the S-4 registration and of course, the shareholder meetings on both sides. But Ed and I are very dedicated to delivering the 3 in 1, $3 million of costs, $1 billion of growth, as a floor. 
So with that, Neal, I'll turn it back to you."

Dow's resolute focus on our priorities was once again evident in the first quarter. The Dow team is clearly building momentum as we head toward our historic Dow Corning and DowDuPont transactions. Simply put, our strategy is working, yet again underscoring the power of our differentiation and integration, coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda and disciplined productivity mindset. The strength of our businesses and our unique business model was on full display as our integrated value-add specialty businesses and broad geographic footprint enabled us to outperform versus our more narrowly focused competitors despite lower hydrocarbon and crop price environments. I am very proud of our team's achievements and their relentless focus and action with self-help actions on productivity, variable margin management and targeted growth driving our agenda. 
We have and will continue to run our businesses to maximize value for our customers and returns for our shareholders as you can see that in our results: 14 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and EBITDA margin expansion; 10 consecutive quarters of volume growth; the highest production volume quarter in our history; and we delivered value for those additional pounds as disciplined margin management enabled the highest EBITDA margin in more than a decade. Importantly, on a trailing 12-month basis, this translated to an expansion in both ROC and EVA. These results have enabled us to increasingly reward our shareholders as we paid our highest regular quarterly dividend in our history of $0.46 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard and Jim to cover highlights from the quarter, updates on Dow Corning and DowDuPont and our plastics outlook. I'll then close the call with our market outlook and strategic priorities. Howard?"
768440,331170422,965919,"The Dow Chemical Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","DuPont de Nemours, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world",1775,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world with North America up 6%; Europe, Middle East, Africa and India up 4%; and Asia Pacific up 3%. This more than offset a decline in Latin America, down 4%. Emerging geographies also continued to grow with India up 13% and Greater China up 5%, reflecting continued consumer-driven demand. 
Overall, price was down 12% primarily due to local price declines of which the largest contributor was the hydrocarbons business and ongoing global currency headwinds. However, it's important to note that our ongoing margin management more than offset these declines, enabling operating EBITDA margin expansion to 21% with some of the strongest gains in our downstream, innovation-focused businesses in Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions. Operating EBITDA was $2.3 billion with notable strength in our transportation, infrastructure and electronic end markets plus an all-time record in Consumer Solutions and a first quarter record in Performance Plastics, which were more than offset by the impact of lower equity earnings and divestitures. 
Moving on to our dashboard of key financial metrics on Slide 7, which reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasingly reward shareholders. And as you see here, over the last 3 years, we've made steady progress against each one. 
Now I'll turn to our segment results on Slide 8 starting with Ag. Agricultural Sciences' operating EBITDA was nearly flat with EBITDA margin up 250 basis points. The result exemplifies our self-help mindset as disciplined productivity essentially offset the impact of challenging market conditions and currency headwinds. We also reached further milestones in our innovation agenda. In the ENLIST program, we launched cotton in U.S. In Crop Protection, the business progressed its investments in support of launches from its product pipeline for novel herbicides, such as Arylex and Rinskor and Inatreq fungicide. Looking ahead, we maintain our view that the market will be down 3% to 5% this year as we expect high yields in the Americas, high channel inventories, ongoing currency headwinds and low crop prices. While it may be too early to call the bottom, we are encouraged to see corn and soybean pricing rise from recent lows. And long term, the world continues to meet solutions that will drive greater Ag productivity. 
Turning now to Consumer Solutions on Slide 9. This segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record and margin expanded 400 basis points, reflecting robust demand for Dow's innovative product portfolios in the automotive and the semiconductor sectors. Dow Automotive Systems achieved volume gains on above-market demand for solutions enabling light-weighting and sound dampening performance. The business launched a new BETAMATE solution for structural impact performance as well as technologies for advanced floor protection solutions. In Electronic Materials, despite a decline in demand for applications tied to personal computer components, we benefited from new business wins for Semiconductor and Display Technologies. 
For Infrastructure Solutions on Slide 10. EBITDA was essentially flat despite lower equity earnings and margin expanded 220 basis points. Dow Building & Construction delivered double-digit volume growth with increases across all geographic areas on strong demand for our construction chemicals portfolio and STYROFOAM insulation. Here, too, our innovations are delivering as we saw continued adoption of the FR63 flame-retardant technology as well as progress with our INSTA STIK roofing adhesives and our LIQUIDARMOR flashing and sealants. 
Energy & Water Solutions continued to be impacted by headwinds in oil and gas exploration. During the quarter, our water business reached a milestone as its new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia sold its first production. This facility is targeted to meet demand in the emerging world for Dow separation technologies. I'm pleased to report that the site is already delivering our differentiated value-added products and is operating at similar rates and yield as our state-of-the-art operation in Minnesota. 
Performance Monomers' profitability improved partly due to the business' decision to reduce its merchant sales exposure. And in Dow Coating Materials, the business grew volume due to improvements in industrial and architectural coating sectors, benefiting from a strategy to broaden Dow's participation in these end markets. The business continued to broaden its product portfolio, launching 5 new vinyl acrylic binders. In equity earnings, Dow Corning's silicones delivered a double-digit earnings increase on strong volume growth. 
On Slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals increased volumes in most businesses. Polyurethanes delivered a double-digit volume increase on demand for system house applications and specialty polyols as the business continued to shift its mix into higher-value offerings. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline despite strength in the durables markets on weaker de-icer demand due to a milder winter. We also saw a notable decline in our equity earnings in the segment, consistent with our modeling guidance, from the ramp-up of Sadara spending, a change in ownership of MEGlobal and lower MEG prices. 
Performance Plastics on Slide 12 delivered a record first quarter operating EBITDA with volume gains across all businesses. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved a new record polyethylene sales volume in the quarter, driven by operational reliability and robust demand for its differentiated products. The business continued to advance its innovation agenda with new launches in several product families, including AGILITY for food packaging, INFUSE for health and hygiene and INNATE for industrial and consumer packaging. 
Gains were achieved in most geographic areas, led by North America and Asia Pacific with double-digit growth in China. Earnings grew in our Thai JVs on stronger Asian naphtha chain margins. These results were more than offset by a greater than $100 million headwind in Argentina due to our facility outage and the reduction of import barriers. Elastomers delivered earnings growth on higher demand for its differentiated technologies that enhanced the customer experience in transportation and high-performance athletic footwear. And Electrical and Telecommunications achieved double-digit volume growth on demand for infrastructure projects, subsea cable and fiber optics. 
Turning to our second quarter and full year modeling guidance on Slide 13. In the second quarter, we do expect a seasonal uptick in infrastructure, which lifts our Building & Construction, coatings and Electrical and Telecommunications businesses. In Performance Plastics, we expect year-over-year margin compression in Europe as well as reduced earnings from our position in Latin America. In Ag, we expect the market headwinds to persist. However, with our continued self-help actions, we expect the first half of 2016 to be comparable to the same period in 2015 when adjusted for the impact of divestitures. 
In 2016, we continue to bring on several earnings growth catalysts, starting with the PDH contribution, which will continue to build throughout the year. The startup of new units of Sadara will also continue. In fact, the second Solution Polyethylene train came online this month. Turnarounds and maintenance spending will be higher sequentially in the second quarter by $100 million to $150 million. We expect lower equity earnings to continue as a result of our portfolio actions and the Sadara unit startups. Turnarounds and equity earnings headwinds in the second quarter will primarily impact Performance Materials & Chemicals. And that will subside in the back half of the year. 
The Dow Corning transaction is expected to be a tailwind in the second half of the year, and we will benefit from ethane cracking enhancements in Louisiana toward the end of the year. We also see pension expense continuing to provide a tailwind. As we look ahead, we expect our operating tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the range of 23% to 27%. We expect our reported rate to fall in the 7% to 12% range in the second quarter, assuming a successful Dow Corning close. 
I'll wrap up my comments this morning with an update on the Dow Corning transaction on Slide 15. We have made significant progress toward the integration and will hit the ground running immediately following close. In the first quarter, the transaction received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS, and we have made steady progress on the regulatory front with approval from several key jurisdictions, including China, Japan and the EU. Joint integration teams composed of Dow and Dow Corning leaders have been working together since the 1st of the year to set the foundation for a successful integration. With an eye toward our post-close priorities, we established the business and the organizational structure that will lead Dow Corning in the future. The team is aligned to 3 areas of focus: delivery of the 2016 plan and the market- and technology-based growth in our key sectors, such as infrastructure, transportation and consumer care; productivity and asset management; as well as the seamless integration and realization of our cost synergies. 
I want to take a moment to talk about cost synergies and the work the team has accomplished to date, which you'll see on Slide 16. As we said in December, this transaction provides Dow an opportunity to own all of the silicones business and secure enhanced cost and growth synergies that are unique to Dow as the owner. Dow Corning silicones is a successful and thriving business that Dow helped build over the last 70-plus years. This transaction enhances our market-facing businesses with a high-quality silicones franchise and provides a catalyst for growth. It allows Dow to accelerate our narrower and deeper focus in our key value chains, including transportation, infrastructure, consumer care and electronics. 
Because we know the business so well, there is a tremendous value in the synergy capture. And here, Dow is uniquely positioned to access quick wins. The $300 million of cost synergies will focus on back-office and operational efficiencies. And we expect to achieve 100% run rate within 24 months after closing. You see here our latest estimate of how this will develop. We expect to deliver a 65% target run rate within 12 months. The team has now completed their work to validate our cost synergy target and their findings give me great confidence that we will hit our commitment. In total, we still see this transaction adding more than $1 billion in additional EBITDA for Dow on a full year basis post synergy capture. It will also be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year 1. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

We continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. Here, you see our updated time line. All key deliverables remain",1066,"Thank you, Howard. Turning now to Slide 17. We continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. Here, you see our updated time line. All key deliverables remain on track. A major milestone in the quarter was the filing of the Form S-4 registration statement. And just last week, we followed up with the First Amendment. We continue to expect the S-4 will be made effective in the second quarter. Following that, both Dow and DuPont will set the date for our respective special meetings for shareholders to vote on the merger. The second major milestone in the quarter was our formation of a Joint Implementation Management Office or Joint IMO, which is driving the integration process across the 2 companies. And the third milestone was both companies jointly engaging McKinsey, who has assisted many other companies through large successful integrations. 
Turning to Slide 18. With oversight from the Joint Executive Steering Committee, the Joint IMO is developing execution-ready plans to ensure that we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as 3 independent divisions as soon as possible post close. The clear objective of the Joint IMO, which Rick Olson from DuPont and I co-lead, is speed of execution, speed to close, speed to capture the synergies and speed to spin. The team is squarely focused on that mission. Soon after forming the Joint IMO, we commissioned multiple subteams focused on a diversity of work streams, from governance to stand-up and separation activities to sourcing and purchasing. There have already been numerous joint planning meetings between the 2 companies. Plans are progressing well, and we continue to make significant progress to realize the vision for the merger and the subsequent intended spins. 
One of the key deliverables for this team is an execution-ready playbook to achieve our greater than $3 billion synergy target. In this space, we've already done considerable benchmarking to validate our targets. We followed a rigorous process coordinated by McKinsey to provide objectivity and external validation for our assumptions. We compared various financial metrics for the intended spins against best-in-class peers. We did this across businesses and functions. This independent benchmarking yielded a similar answer as the joint working session our companies held prior to announcing the merger. This is just one of the reasons why we feel even more confident in the target and the opportunity in front of us. 
We're equally excited about our near-term earnings growth for drivers, which are on Slide 20. In March, our PDH plant successfully completed the performance test and achieved full run rates less than 2 months after startup. The unit recently went down for plant maintenance and will begin ramping back up next week. We made significant progress on the construction of our Louisiana flexibility project, which is now 95% complete. And in Texas, our Texas-9 cracker is 50% complete with more than 80% of the equipment installed. In Saudi Arabia, we have started our second polyethylene plant on purchased ethylene and have proven several of the major cracker components. We continue to move forward with the startup of this impressive site and expect those activities to accelerate as we proceed through the year. And our multiyear productivity push continues to deliver bottom line results. 
Let's now take a moment to discuss our outlook for the plastics and feedstocks markets, starting with polyethylene on Slide 21. Some are projecting much looser balances for the second half of the year and into next year. The main point of disagreement that we have with consultant projections is the speed in which new U.S. projects are brought online as well as assumptions about projects in Asia and the Middle East, which we find overly optimistic. If you look at history, you will see that industry supply projections are almost always higher than what is achieved due to project cancellations, construction delays and labor constraints. For example, in 2007, supply projections for 2012 were about 6 world-scale ethylene crackers higher than what became reality. We generally agree on the demand projections in these scenarios, which rest on sustainable urbanization in the developing world. 10 years ago, China's per capita use of polyethylene was roughly 1/5 of the United States. Today, it's half and this trend will continue. Our view is highlighted in the chart on the right. If you overlay more realistic assumptions about the ability of the industry to bring new facilities online, we see sustainably high rates of ethylene and polyethylene utilization for the next several years. 
In this environment, we believe that lasting value creation comes from participating in the entire plastics value chain, as outlined on Slide 22. The dynamics across the chain can shift significantly over time. The long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, geographic diversification, innovation and differentiation. No one rivals Dow on this front. And our results have shown this time and time again. 
First, we believe the value of our advantaged feedstock positions will grow. Feedstock flexibility remains one of our signature advantages of Dow's cracker fleet. This, combined with our European LPG capabilities and U.S. PDH, form structural hedges for the exposure to frac spread pressures. And we continue to see ethane and propane balances being favorable for some time. We have given our updated outlooks for these in the appendix. Bottom line, our view hasn't changed. We see plenty of NGLs available for the new crackers based on continued growth and gas demand. 
Second, European and Asian naphtha cracker margins will continue to reflect tight conditions as underlying demand surpasses realized supply while the U.S. ethylene balance will be somewhat looser. Third, polyethylene over ethylene margins are likely to remain solid as polyethylene capacity additions lag ethylene expansions, especially in the U.S. The key point here is that it's consumer demand that drives the market balances. And finally, the value of Dow's differentiation should grow. We've proven the value of our customer intimacy and our differentiated portfolio time and again. We are the innovator for the packaging, elastomers and electrical and telecommunications industries.

In short, we expect to see continued consumer-driven demand around much of the world. We see strong demand signals in North America, gradual recovery in Europe and ongoing consumer-led demand growth in China, all of which are driving the need for Dow's unique products, underscoring our innovation, market access and integration, enabling us to deliver value in our selected market sectors. We saw this in the quarter in the performance of our Building & Construction, Elastomers, Automotive and Electronic Materials businesses, where our smart-sized scale enabled us to produce high-margin, technology-rich solutions faster and to commercialize them more quickly in the key sectors these businesses serve and grow faster than smaller-sized competitors. 
We believe that pockets of volatility will persist, including near-term geopolitical and economic uncertainty, most notably in Brazil. Supply surpluses will continue in agriculture and energy. This outlook is what we've seen these last many years, and we expect slow economic growth and high volatility to continue in the near term. Going forward, we will continue managing what we can control. We've shown we can grow earnings and volume in this environment. Using a narrower and deeper market focus, targeted innovation and our exceptional low-cost and integrated position in the value chain, the Dow business model has outperformed its peers in the last several years. Despite a mixed market outlook, we believe we can continue to do so. 
If you turn to Slide 25, I'll end the call today by reiterating that we remain squarely aligned around 3 clear priorities this year. Priority one, deliver our 2016 plan. As the quarter showed, we are delivering and will continue to do so. Priority two, close the Dow Corning transaction. As Howard said, we are ready to implement and have clear targets in place to meet or exceed expectations. And priority three, move swiftly through the key steps of the DowDuPont transaction. As you heard from Jim, we are on track and will continue to see the $3 billion in projected cost synergies as the floor. And we are driven by the mantra, speed to close, speed to spin. 
Our team has clear goals and a resolute focus on achieving them. Our unique combination of differentiation and integration, coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda is delivering results. Our broad geographic footprint and relentless productivity mindset will serve us well in the face of volatility and regional and market headwinds. The Dow team is building momentum towards the integration of the Dow Corning silicones business, the creation of DowDuPont and the ultimate creation of the new materialsco, to be named Dow, a growth company with a winning portfolio. These once-in-a-generation transactions, further bolstered by our near-term growth drivers and our relentless focus on execution, will enable new levels of value creation for our customers and generate even greater returns for our shareholders. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

A couple of quick ones on that. You obviously outlined your views on NGL. So if you could just tell us what sort of -- within those views of NGL pricing, what sort of natural gas and crude oil pricing assumptions do you have? So that's one part of it. And the second part is that, in my mind, obviously part of the continued strength within Performance Plastics was low NGL prices. But the other part was a rebound in ethylene prices. So could you also tell us who right now is setting the price for ethylene? Is it MTO?"

We believe that gas is really going to be very well supplied over this 5-year horizon. And I think in most cases, gas remains sub-$3, maybe it runs between $3 and $4, depending on where oil price goes. Our other view is at $50 to $60 a barrel oil, the NGL supply is going to expand significantly in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. So when you combine that with the fact that the crackers' completion schedule and their RTO horizon is stretching out, and that spreads that NGL demand intensity out, and that's reflected in what we put in the appendix. Ethane export starts out this year, but that growth is slow. And propane competition right now is acting as a cracker -- as the ceiling for the prices at the cracker level. In fact, it's back into the slate. And if you look at first quarter, ethane and propane were kind of in an even tradeoff in the cracker slate. So we think the outlook for NGLs for all these projects is going to be just fine. And then we'll continue to have a favorable balance there, and you'll see that in the oil and gas ratios as well. As far as ethylene, ethylene moved up $0.05 in March. And I think a little bit of that is some bounce-back in volume demand. As you could see from our own results, volume growth is good there and you also see some impacts of different outages around the world, some planned, some unplanned. Look, I'm not a believer yet in this whole theory that MTO is setting the pricing out there. I think demand is setting the price. And MTO may be a factor in some commodity grades of ethylene, polyethylene in China. But for most of the marketplace, I think you've also got a very, very competitive U.S. Gulf Coast situation that's helped setting that price."

And the focus and the execution was evident. It was really around productivity. If you remember, we were one of the first in the ag space to really declare that the ag market was starting to slow down. And so they got ahead of it with footprint rationalizations and lower SG&A and lower R&D in a focused way. So that was one of the big differentiators of the results this quarter.

I'll talk about our performance, and then we'll talk about the peers next. First, on plastics, I think one of the things that is not evident just at the high level on the numbers is we had about $100 million headwind from Latin America. And it was a combination of currencies and obviously the changes that have happened in Argentina as they removed duties and opened up. So people won't see that in terms of the high-level numbers. In Europe, we saw strong business in Europe, just as you mentioned, and I don't think our view there is any different than our peers. When you look at Performance Materials & Chemicals, I'd say that delta is 50-50. And if you look at Polyurethanes in Performance Materials & chemicals, they're carrying the burden this year of the higher start-up cost of Sadara. So you have to -- on a run rate basis, you have to think about where they will be next year. And they will also got some commodity price pressures in some parts of the chain, mostly in isocyanates right now. And then in Industrial Solutions, Howard mentioned that we actually -- with the step-down on MEGlobal and also the lower MEG prices, that hits Industrial Solutions earnings. So if you look about at Industrial Solutions, how they did year-over-year, that's carrying that step-down in MEGlobal and MEG prices and also a de-icing season that was 50% lighter than it was last year and the weight of oil and gas sectors. Some of the EO Derivatives go into the oil and gas sector and they're carrying that. So I think that explains really most of our own performance. On peer comparisons, you have to adjust for 1x in portfolio differences, so divestiture sales, and then the portfolio difference. Some of our peers are heavy into polypropylene. And of course, we don't play in that space. When you take those things out and put it on an apples-to-apples basis, I think you'll see that it's a slight beat there."

And it's that combination, Jim had it on Slide, I think, 22, that shows that we can make money at different parts of -- in his particular case, he referenced the plastics business. So we think that's detaching itself from that oil number quite substantially. In fact, Frank, if you've seen our 14 quarters in a row and 10 quarters in a row of volume increase, if you see how that volume increase is made up, it's mixed. And it's mixed under -- if you look at the extremes of oil price, we've had oil price as high as $120 in that full year period and oil price as low as in the high 20s in that same period, yet we've grown volume through sustained execution of products people need.

Currently, that's obviously, I think, the way the market, the financial market is headed, but -- and they're usually ahead of when the supply/demand balance is. And our view in the back half of the year, that supply/demand is going to balance. Q1 output in the U.S. was down 200,000 barrels a day quarter-over-quarter.

We're off to a strong start to the year, which is continuing the 3.5 year streak of earnings growth, managing all sorts of environments. That's coming because we, firstly, have targeted growth and the portfolio is built for this environment. The diversification works. And frankly, we are finding growth where growth is and we're seeing great numbers coming out of our various regions and end-use markets, whether it be China, here in the U.S. or even in Europe. We're benefiting from strong margin management and a strong focus on ROC. And then that's the next point I want to make. The U.S. and Chinese markets are strong markets and we have strong outlooks there. We can continue to grow margin in those markets under these environments because we do have the product mix. And that last question on Europe means we have the feedstock flex to keep making margins in a recovering Europe. U.S., Europe and China being strong for us is something we've now seen for a while and is continuing to build momentum. And then the 2 transactions, both Howard and Jim outlined it, the questions were asked on the transactions. We are moving towards these transactions becoming a reality. And we're planning very strongly to execute the synergies and execute them and lean into them and execute them quickly and execute them. So in the case of the DowDuPont transaction, we move to the spins as fast as we can. In the case of the Dow Corning transaction, so that we integrate. Howard's numbers of $300 million of cost synergies and $100 million of growth, just a reminder, it's about 8% of revenue. We did double-digit percentage of revenues on synergies on both Carbide and Rohm and Haas. So we have a strong record of executing the synergy targets that we will talk about. We'll have a lot more to say about DowDuPont and the specifics on that in ensuing calls as we go towards the S-4 registration, and of course, the shareholder meetings on both sides. Both Ed and I are very dedicated to delivering the 3 and 1 [ph]: $3 billion of costs, $1 billion of growth as a floor. So with that, Neal, I'll turn it back to you."

Dow's resolute focus on our priorities was once again evident in the first quarter. The Dow team is clearly building momentum as we head toward our historic Dow Corning and DowDuPont transactions. Simply put, our strategy is working, yet again underscoring the power of our differentiation and integration, coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda and disciplined productivity mindset. The strength of our businesses and our unique business model was on full display as our integrated value-add specialty businesses and broad geographic footprint enabled us to outperform versus our more narrowly focused competitors despite lower hydrocarbon and crop price environments. I am very proud of our team's achievements and their relentless focus and action with self-help actions on productivity, variable margin management and targeted growth driving our agenda. 
We have and will continue to run our businesses to maximize value for our customers and returns for our shareholders as you can see that in our results: 14 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and EBITDA margin expansion; 10 consecutive quarters of volume growth; the highest production volume quarter in our history; and we delivered value for those additional pounds as disciplined margin management enabled the highest EBITDA margin in more than a decade. Importantly, on a trailing 12-month basis, this translated to an expansion in both ROC and EVA. These results have enabled us to increasingly reward our shareholders as we paid our highest regular quarterly dividend in our history of $0.46 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard and Jim to cover highlights from the quarter, updates on Dow Corning and DowDuPont and our plastics outlook. I'll then close the call with our market outlook and strategic priorities. Howard?"
768440,331170422,966208,"The Dow Chemical Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","DuPont de Nemours, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world",1775,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world with North America up 6%; Europe, Middle East, Africa and India up 4%; and Asia Pacific up 3%. This more than offset a decline in Latin America, down 4%. Emerging geographies also continued to grow with India up 13% and Greater China up 5%, reflecting continued consumer-driven demand. 
Overall, price was down 12% primarily due to local price declines of which the largest contributor was the hydrocarbons business and ongoing global currency headwinds. However, it's important to note that our ongoing margin management more than offset these declines, enabling operating EBITDA margin expansion to 21% with some of the strongest gains in our downstream, innovation-focused businesses in Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions. Operating EBITDA was $2.3 billion with notable strength in our transportation, infrastructure and electronic end markets plus an all-time record in Consumer Solutions and a first quarter record in Performance Plastics, which were more than offset by the impact of lower equity earnings and divestitures. 
Moving on to our dashboard of key financial metrics on Slide 7, which reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasingly reward shareholders. And as you see here, over the last 3 years, we've made steady progress against each one. 
Now I'll turn to our segment results on Slide 8 starting with Ag. Agricultural Sciences' operating EBITDA was nearly flat with EBITDA margin up 250 basis points. The result exemplifies our self-help mindset as disciplined productivity essentially offset the impact of challenging market conditions and currency headwinds. We also reached further milestones in our innovation agenda. In the ENLIST program, we launched cotton in U.S. In Crop Protection, the business progressed its investments in support of launches from its product pipeline for novel herbicides, such as Arylex and Rinskor and Inatreq fungicide. Looking ahead, we maintain our view that the market will be down 3% to 5% this year as we expect high yields in the Americas, high channel inventories, ongoing currency headwinds and low crop prices. While it may be too early to call the bottom, we are encouraged to see corn and soybean pricing rise from recent lows. And long term, the world continues to meet solutions that will drive greater Ag productivity. 
Turning now to Consumer Solutions on Slide 9. This segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record and margin expanded 400 basis points, reflecting robust demand for Dow's innovative product portfolios in the automotive and the semiconductor sectors. Dow Automotive Systems achieved volume gains on above-market demand for solutions enabling light-weighting and sound dampening performance. The business launched a new BETAMATE solution for structural impact performance as well as technologies for advanced floor protection solutions. In Electronic Materials, despite a decline in demand for applications tied to personal computer components, we benefited from new business wins for Semiconductor and Display Technologies. 
For Infrastructure Solutions on Slide 10. EBITDA was essentially flat despite lower equity earnings and margin expanded 220 basis points. Dow Building & Construction delivered double-digit volume growth with increases across all geographic areas on strong demand for our construction chemicals portfolio and STYROFOAM insulation. Here, too, our innovations are delivering as we saw continued adoption of the FR63 flame-retardant technology as well as progress with our INSTA STIK roofing adhesives and our LIQUIDARMOR flashing and sealants. 
Energy & Water Solutions continued to be impacted by headwinds in oil and gas exploration. During the quarter, our water business reached a milestone as its new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia sold its first production. This facility is targeted to meet demand in the emerging world for Dow separation technologies. I'm pleased to report that the site is already delivering our differentiated value-added products and is operating at similar rates and yield as our state-of-the-art operation in Minnesota. 
Performance Monomers' profitability improved partly due to the business' decision to reduce its merchant sales exposure. And in Dow Coating Materials, the business grew volume due to improvements in industrial and architectural coating sectors, benefiting from a strategy to broaden Dow's participation in these end markets. The business continued to broaden its product portfolio, launching 5 new vinyl acrylic binders. In equity earnings, Dow Corning's silicones delivered a double-digit earnings increase on strong volume growth. 
On Slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals increased volumes in most businesses. Polyurethanes delivered a double-digit volume increase on demand for system house applications and specialty polyols as the business continued to shift its mix into higher-value offerings. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline despite strength in the durables markets on weaker de-icer demand due to a milder winter. We also saw a notable decline in our equity earnings in the segment, consistent with our modeling guidance, from the ramp-up of Sadara spending, a change in ownership of MEGlobal and lower MEG prices. 
Performance Plastics on Slide 12 delivered a record first quarter operating EBITDA with volume gains across all businesses. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved a new record polyethylene sales volume in the quarter, driven by operational reliability and robust demand for its differentiated products. The business continued to advance its innovation agenda with new launches in several product families, including AGILITY for food packaging, INFUSE for health and hygiene and INNATE for industrial and consumer packaging. 
Gains were achieved in most geographic areas, led by North America and Asia Pacific with double-digit growth in China. Earnings grew in our Thai JVs on stronger Asian naphtha chain margins. These results were more than offset by a greater than $100 million headwind in Argentina due to our facility outage and the reduction of import barriers. Elastomers delivered earnings growth on higher demand for its differentiated technologies that enhanced the customer experience in transportation and high-performance athletic footwear. And Electrical and Telecommunications achieved double-digit volume growth on demand for infrastructure projects, subsea cable and fiber optics. 
Turning to our second quarter and full year modeling guidance on Slide 13. In the second quarter, we do expect a seasonal uptick in infrastructure, which lifts our Building & Construction, coatings and Electrical and Telecommunications businesses. In Performance Plastics, we expect year-over-year margin compression in Europe as well as reduced earnings from our position in Latin America. In Ag, we expect the market headwinds to persist. However, with our continued self-help actions, we expect the first half of 2016 to be comparable to the same period in 2015 when adjusted for the impact of divestitures. 
In 2016, we continue to bring on several earnings growth catalysts, starting with the PDH contribution, which will continue to build throughout the year. The startup of new units of Sadara will also continue. In fact, the second Solution Polyethylene train came online this month. Turnarounds and maintenance spending will be higher sequentially in the second quarter by $100 million to $150 million. We expect lower equity earnings to continue as a result of our portfolio actions and the Sadara unit startups. Turnarounds and equity earnings headwinds in the second quarter will primarily impact Performance Materials & Chemicals. And that will subside in the back half of the year. 
The Dow Corning transaction is expected to be a tailwind in the second half of the year, and we will benefit from ethane cracking enhancements in Louisiana toward the end of the year. We also see pension expense continuing to provide a tailwind. As we look ahead, we expect our operating tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the range of 23% to 27%. We expect our reported rate to fall in the 7% to 12% range in the second quarter, assuming a successful Dow Corning close. 
I'll wrap up my comments this morning with an update on the Dow Corning transaction on Slide 15. We have made significant progress toward the integration and will hit the ground running immediately following close. In the first quarter, the transaction received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS, and we have made steady progress on the regulatory front with approval from several key jurisdictions, including China, Japan and the EU. Joint integration teams composed of Dow and Dow Corning leaders have been working together since the 1st of the year to set the foundation for a successful integration. With an eye toward our post-close priorities, we established the business and the organizational structure that will lead Dow Corning in the future. The team is aligned to 3 areas of focus: delivery of the 2016 plan and the market- and technology-based growth in our key sectors, such as infrastructure, transportation and consumer care; productivity and asset management; as well as the seamless integration and realization of our cost synergies. 
I want to take a moment to talk about cost synergies and the work the team has accomplished to date, which you'll see on Slide 16. As we said in December, this transaction provides Dow an opportunity to own all of the silicones business and secure enhanced cost and growth synergies that are unique to Dow as the owner. Dow Corning silicones is a successful and thriving business that Dow helped build over the last 70-plus years. This transaction enhances our market-facing businesses with a high-quality silicones franchise and provides a catalyst for growth. It allows Dow to accelerate our narrower and deeper focus in our key value chains, including transportation, infrastructure, consumer care and electronics. 
Because we know the business so well, there is a tremendous value in the synergy capture. And here, Dow is uniquely positioned to access quick wins. The $300 million of cost synergies will focus on back-office and operational efficiencies. And we expect to achieve 100% run rate within 24 months after closing. You see here our latest estimate of how this will develop. We expect to deliver a 65% target run rate within 12 months. The team has now completed their work to validate our cost synergy target and their findings give me great confidence that we will hit our commitment. In total, we still see this transaction adding more than $1 billion in additional EBITDA for Dow on a full year basis post synergy capture. It will also be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year 1. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

We continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. Here, you see our updated time line. All key deliverables remain",1065,"Thank you, Howard. Turning now to Slide 17. We continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. Here, you see our updated time line. All key deliverables remain on track. A major milestone in the quarter was the filing of the Form S-4 registration statement. And just last week, we followed up with the First Amendment. We continue to expect the S-4 will be made effective in the second quarter. Following that, both Dow and DuPont will set the date for our respective special meetings for shareholders to vote on the merger. The second major milestone in the quarter was our formation of a Joint Implementation Management Office or Joint IMO, which is driving the integration process across the 2 companies. And the third milestone was both companies jointly engaging McKinsey, who has assisted many other companies through large successful integrations. 
Turning to Slide 18. With oversight from the Joint Executive Steering Committee, the Joint IMO is developing execution-ready plans to ensure that we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as 3 independent divisions as soon as possible post close. The clear objective of the Joint IMO, which Rick Olson from DuPont and I co-lead, is speed of execution, speed to close, speed to capture the synergies and speed to spin. The team is squarely focused on that mission. Soon after forming the Joint IMO, we commissioned multiple subteams focused on a diversity of work streams, from governance to stand-up and separation activities to sourcing and purchasing. There have already been numerous joint planning meetings between the 2 companies. Plans are progressing well, and we continue to make significant progress to realize the vision for the merger and the subsequent intended spins. 
One of the key deliverables for this team is an execution-ready playbook to achieve our greater than $3 billion synergy target. In this space, we've already done considerable benchmarking to validate our targets. We followed a rigorous process coordinated by McKinsey to provide objectivity and external validation for our assumptions. We compared various financial metrics for the intended spins against best-in-class peers. We did this across businesses and functions. This independent benchmarking yielded a similar answer as the joint working session our companies held prior to announcing the merger. This is just one of the reasons why we feel even more competent in the target and the opportunity in front of us. 
We're equally excited about our near-term earnings growth drivers, which are on Slide 20. In March, our PDH plant successfully completed the performance test and achieved full run rates less than 2 months after startup. The unit recently went down for plant maintenance and will begin ramping back up next week. We made significant progress on the construction of our Louisiana flexibility project, which is now 95% complete. And in Texas, our Texas-9 cracker is 50% complete with more than 80% of the equipment installed. In Saudi Arabia, we have started our second polyethylene plant on purchased ethylene and have proven several of the major cracker components. We continue to move forward with the startup of this impressive site and expect those activities to accelerate as we proceed through the year. And our multiyear productivity push continues to deliver bottom line results. 
Let's now take a moment to discuss our outlook for the plastics and feedstocks markets, starting with polyethylene on Slide 21. Some are projecting much looser balances for the second half of the year and into next year. The main point of disagreement that we have with consultant projections is the speed in which new U.S. projects are brought online as well as assumptions about projects in Asia and the Middle East, which we find overly optimistic. If you look at history, you will see that industry supply projections are almost always higher than what is achieved due to project cancellations, construction delays and labor constraints. For example, in 2007, supply projections for 2012 were about 6 world-scale ethylene crackers higher than what became reality. We generally agree on the demand projections in these scenarios, which rest on sustainable urbanization in the developing world. 10 years ago, China's per capita use of polyethylene was roughly 1/5 of the United States. Today, it's half and this trend will continue. Our view is highlighted in the chart on the right. If you overlay more realistic assumptions about the ability of the industry to bring new facilities online, we see sustainably high rates of ethylene and polyethylene utilization for the next several years. 
In this environment, we believe that lasting value creation comes from participating in the entire plastics value chain, as outlined on Slide 22. The dynamics across the chain can shift significantly over time. The long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, geographic diversification, innovation and differentiation. No one rivals Dow on this front. And our results have shown this time and time again. 
First, we believe the value of our advantaged feedstock positions will grow. Feedstock flexibility remains one of our signature advantages of Dow's cracker fleet. This, combined with our European LPG capabilities and U.S. PDH, form structural hedges for the exposure to frac spread pressures. And we continue to see ethane and propane balances being favorable for some time. We have given our updated outlooks for these in the appendix. Bottom line, our view hasn't changed. We see plenty of NGLs available for the new crackers based on continued growth and gas demand. 
Second, European and Asian naphtha cracker margins will continue to reflect tight conditions as underlying demand surpasses realized supply while the U.S. ethylene balance will be somewhat looser. Third, polyethylene over ethylene margins are likely to remain solid as polyethylene capacity additions lag ethylene expansions, especially in the U.S. The key point here is that it's consumer demand that drives the market balances. And finally, the value of Dow's differentiation should grow. We've proven the value of our customer intimacy and our differentiated portfolio time and again. We are the innovator for the packaging, elastomers and electrical and telecommunications industries. And that, coupled with our new capacities in Sadara and the U.S. Gulf Coast, drives growth and advantaged results. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew."

In short, we expect to see continued consumer-driven demand around much of the world. We see strong demand signals in North America, gradual recovery in Europe and ongoing consumer-led demand growth in China, all of which are driving the need for Dow's unique products, underscoring our innovation, market access and integration, enabling us to deliver value in our selected market sectors. We saw this in the quarter in the performance of our Building & Construction, Elastomers, Automotive and Electronic Materials businesses, where our smart-sized scale enabled us to produce high-margin, technology-rich solutions faster and to commercialize them more quickly in the key sectors these businesses serve and grow faster than smaller-sized competitors. 
We believe that pockets of volatility will persist, including near-term geopolitical and economic uncertainty, most notably in Brazil. Supply surpluses will continue in agriculture and energy. This outlook is what we've seen these last many years, and we expect slow economic growth and high volatility to continue in the near term. Going forward, we will continue managing what we can control. We've shown we can grow earnings and volume in this environment. Using a narrower and deeper market focus, targeted innovation and our exceptional low-cost and integrated position in the value chain, the Dow business model has outperformed its peers in the last several years. Despite a mixed market outlook, we believe we can continue to do so. 
If you turn to Slide 25, I'll end the call today by reiterating that we remain squarely aligned around 3 clear priorities this year. Priority one, deliver our 2016 plan. As the quarter showed, we are delivering and will continue to do so. Priority two, close the Dow Corning transaction. As Howard said, we are ready to implement and have clear targets in place to meet or exceed expectations. And priority three, move swiftly through the key steps of the DowDuPont transaction. As you heard from Jim, we are on track and will continue to see the $3 billion in projected cost synergies as the floor. And we are driven by the mantra, speed to close, speed to spin. 
Our team has clear goals and a resolute focus on achieving them. Our unique combination of differentiation and integration, coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda is delivering results. Our broad geographic footprint and relentless productivity mindset will serve us well in the face of volatility and regional and market headwinds. The Dow team is building momentum towards the integration of the Dow Corning silicones business, the creation of DowDuPont and the ultimate creation of the new materials co, to be named Dow, a growth company with a winning portfolio. These once-in-a-generation transactions, further bolstered by our near-term growth drivers and our relentless focus on execution, will enable new levels of value creation for our customers and generate even greater returns for our shareholders. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

So could you also tell us who right now is setting the price for ethylene? Is it MTO?"

We believe that gas is really going to be very well supplied over this 5-year horizon. And I think in most cases, gas remains sub-$3, maybe it runs between $3 and $4, depending on where oil price goes. Our other view is at $50 to $60 a barrel oil, the NGL supply is going to expand significantly in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. So when you combine that with the fact that the crackers' completion schedule and their RTO horizon is stretching out, and that spreads that NGL demand intensity out, and that's reflected in what we put in the appendix. Ethane export starts up this year, but that growth is slow. And propane competition right now is acting as a cracker -- as a ceiling for the prices at the cracker level. In fact, it's back into the site. And if you look at first quarter, ethane and propane were kind of in at even tradeoff in the cracker slate. So we think the outlook for NGLs for all these projects is going to be just fine. And then we'll continue to have a favorable balance there, and you'll see that in the oil and gas ratios as well. As far as ethylene, ethylene moved up $0.05 in March. And I think a little bit of that is some bounce-back in volume demand. As you could see from our own results, volume growth is good there and you also see some impacts of different outages around the world, some planned, some unplanned. Look, I'm not a believer yet in this whole theory that MTO is setting the pricing out there. I think demand is setting the pricing. MTO may be a factor in some commodity grades of ethylene, polyethylene in China.

On a down 10% top line, they were able to keep EBITDA flat. Actually, if you exclude the divestitures, it was actually up a couple of percentage points. So they did just a tremendous job. And the focus and the execution was evident. It was really around productivity. If you remember, we were one of the first in the ag space to really declare that the ag market was starting to slow down. And so they got ahead of it with footprint rationalizations and lower SG&A and lower R&D in a focused way. So that was one of the big differentiators of the results this quarter. On your last question relative to DowDuPont, look, I mean, as you heard from Jim in the prepared remarks, we're on track with the closing before the end of the year.

I'll talk about our performance, and then we'll talk about the peers next. First, on plastics, I think one of the things that is not evident just at the high level on the numbers is we had about $100 million headwind from Latin America. And it was a combination of currencies and obviously the changes that happened in Argentina as they removed duties and opened up. So people won't see that in terms of the high-level numbers. In Europe, we saw strong business in Europe, just as you mentioned, and I don't think our view there is any different than our peers. When you look at Performance Materials & Chemicals, I'd say that delta is 50-50. And if you look at Polyurethanes in Performance Materials & Chemicals, they're carrying the burden this year of the higher start-up cost of Sadara. So you have to -- on a run rate basis, you have to think about where they will be next year. And [indiscernible]  also got some commodity price pressures in some parts of the chain, mostly in isocyanates right now. And then in Industrial Solutions, Howard mentioned that we actually -- with the step-down on MEGlobal and also the lower MEG prices, that hits Industrial Solutions earnings. So if you look about at Industrial Solutions, how they did year-over-year, that's carrying that step-down in MEGlobal and MEG prices and also a de-icing season that was 50% lighter than it was last year and the weight of oil and gas sectors. Some of the EO Derivatives go into the oil and gas sector and they're carrying that. So I think that explains really most of our own performance. On peer comparisons, you have to adjust for 1x in portfolio differences, so divestiture sales, and then the portfolio difference. Some of our peers are heavy into polypropylene. And of course, we don't play in that space. When you take those things out and put it on an apples-to-apples basis, I think you'll see that it's a slight beat there."

Look, I've just been in both Europe and Asia, specifically Japan and China. I would tell you the low oil price phenomena is seeping through to the consumer economy in both places actually as oil importers. And that's been a sustained trend now for several quarters. You're seeing consumption increase. And then double down on our products that we supply, some of the very specialty products that we have downstream, these are products that the Chinas and the Europes need, whether it be lightweight materials for cars or whether it be building insulation for energy-efficient buildings. On and on, our innovation agenda is working in those economies. So we're seeing sustainable volumes because we can actually sell out asset and sell up asset. And it's that combination, Jim had it on Slide, I think, 22, that shows that we can make money at different parts of -- in his particular case, he referenced the plastics business. So we think that's detaching itself from that oil number quite substantially. In fact, Frank, if you've seen our 14 quarters in a row and 10 quarters in a row of volume increase, if you see how that volume increase is made up, it's mixed. And it's mixed under -- if you look at the extremes of oil price, we've had oil price as high as $120 in that full year period and oil price as low as in the high 20s in that same period, yet we've grown volume through sustained execution of products people need.

There's demand obviously for natural gas. And as that natural gas demand increases and you start to see frac spreads come back -- so your point on exports, you're starting to see some improvements in the frac spreads. As you start to see those come back, although we think they're going to remain subdued, maybe frac spreads will be $1, $1.50 a million Btu, that's enough incentive for people to take more out of the gas. And you're going to start to see some NGLs become more available there. And then the other factor is oil price. And our view is oil is going to $50 to $60. Currently, that's obviously, I think, the way the market, the financial market is headed, but -- and they're usually ahead of when the supply/demand balance is. And our view in the back half of the year, that supply/demand is going to balance. Q1 output in the U.S. was down 200,000 barrels a day quarter-over-quarter. I think the back half, you're going to see that tighten up a bit more, and then into 2017. So those 2 factors, I think from our view, are going to continue to drive the availability of those NGLs."

You've seen a little bit come back to support Shell. Obviously, Port of Megera came back up to support Shell. The other thing is the shift towards LPG cracking on our side. We've shifted to a very high percent of LPG cracking and we continue to look at opportunities to make small incremental investments to expand that. And that flexibility has helped us out tremendously. So I don't see that's going to stop. So I think Europe has got a pretty good handle, Dow in particular.

We're off to a strong start to the year, which is continuing the 3.5 year streak of earnings growth, managing all sorts of environments. That's coming because we, firstly, have targeted growth and the portfolio is built for this environment. The diversification works. And frankly, we are finding growth where growth is and we're seeing great numbers coming out of our various regions and end-use markets, whether it be China, here in the U.S. or even in Europe. We're benefiting from strong margin management and a strong focus on ROC. And then that's the next point I want to make. The U.S. and Chinese markets are strong markets and we have strong outlooks there. We can continue to grow margin in those markets under these environments because we do have the product mix. And that last question on Europe means we have the feedstock flex to keep making margins in a recovering Europe. U.S., Europe and China being strong for us is something we've now seen for a while and is continuing to build momentum. And then the 2 transactions, both Howard and Jim outlined it, the questions were asked on the transactions. We are moving towards these transactions becoming a reality. And we're planning very strongly to execute the synergies and execute them and lean into them and execute them quickly and execute them. So in the case of the DowDuPont transaction, we move to the spins as fast as we can. In the case of the Dow Corning transaction, so that we integrate. Howard's numbers of $300 million of cost synergies and $100 million of growth, just to remind you, it's about 8% of revenue. We did double-digit percentage of revenues on synergies on both Carbide and Rohm and Haas. So we have a strong record of executing the synergy targets that we will talk about. We'll have a lot more to say about DowDuPont and the specifics on that in ensuing calls as we go towards the S-4 registration, and of course, the shareholder meetings on both sides. Both Ed and I are very dedicated to delivering the 3 and 1 [ph]: $3 billion of costs, $1 billion of growth as a floor. So with that, Neal, I'll turn it back to you."

Dow's resolute focus on our priorities was once again evident in the first quarter. The Dow team is clearly building momentum as we head toward our historic Dow Corning and DowDuPont transactions. Simply put, our strategy is working, yet again underscoring the power of our differentiation and integration, coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda and disciplined productivity mindset. The strength of our businesses and our unique business model was on full display as our integrated value-add specialty businesses and broad geographic footprint enabled us to outperform versus our more narrowly focused competitors despite lower hydrocarbon and crop price environments. I am very proud of our team's achievements and their relentless focus and action with self-help actions on productivity, variable margin management and targeted growth driving our agenda. 
We have and will continue to run our businesses to maximize value for our customers and returns for our shareholders as you can see that in our results: 14 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and EBITDA margin expansion; 10 consecutive quarters of volume growth; the highest production volume quarter in our history; and we delivered value for those additional pounds as disciplined margin management enabled the highest EBITDA margin in more than a decade. Importantly, on a trailing 12-month basis, this translated to an expansion in both ROC and EVA. These results have enabled us to increasingly reward our shareholders as we paid our highest regular quarterly dividend in our history of $0.46 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard and Jim to cover highlights from the quarter, updates on Dow Corning and DowDuPont and our plastics outlook. I'll then close the call with our market outlook and strategic priorities. Howard?"

Turning to Slide 6. Our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world",1775,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world with North America up 6%; Europe, Middle East, Africa and India up 4%; and Asia Pacific up 3%. This more than offset a decline in Latin America, down 4%. Emerging geographies also continued to grow with India up 13% and Greater China up 5%, reflecting continued consumer-driven demand. 
Overall, price was down 12% primarily due to local price declines of which the largest contributor was the hydrocarbons business and ongoing global currency headwinds. However, it's important to note that our ongoing margin management more than offset these declines, enabling operating EBITDA margin expansion to 21% with some of the strongest gains in our downstream, innovation-focused businesses in Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions. Operating EBITDA was $2.3 billion with notable strength in our transportation, infrastructure and electronic end markets plus an all-time record in Consumer Solutions and a first quarter record in Performance Plastics, which were more than offset by the impact of lower equity earnings and divestitures. 
Moving on to our dashboard of key financial metrics on Slide 7, which reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasingly reward shareholders. And as you see here, over the last 3 years, we've made steady progress against each one. 
Now I'll turn to our segment results on Slide 8 starting with Ag. Agricultural Sciences' operating EBITDA was nearly flat with EBITDA margin up 250 basis points. The result exemplifies our self-help mindset as disciplined productivity essentially offset the impact of challenging market conditions and currency headwinds. We also reached further milestones in our innovation agenda. In the ENLIST program, we launched cotton in U.S. In Crop Protection, the business progressed its investments in support of launches from its product pipeline for novel herbicides, such as Arylex and Rinskor and Inatreq fungicide. Looking ahead, we maintain our view that the market will be down 3% to 5% this year as we expect high yields in the Americas, high channel inventories, ongoing currency headwinds and low crop prices. While it may be too early to call the bottom, we are encouraged to see corn and soybean pricing rise from recent lows. And long term, the world continues to meet solutions that will drive greater Ag productivity. 
Turning now to Consumer Solutions on Slide 9. This segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record and margin expanded 400 basis points, reflecting robust demand for Dow's innovative product portfolios in the automotive and the semiconductor sectors. Dow Automotive Systems achieved volume gains on above-market demand for solutions enabling light-weighting and sound dampening performance. The business launched a new BETAMATE solution for structural impact performance as well as technologies for advanced floor protection solutions. In Electronic Materials, despite a decline in demand for applications tied to personal computer components, we benefited from new business wins for Semiconductor and Display Technologies. 
For Infrastructure Solutions on Slide 10. EBITDA was essentially flat despite lower equity earnings and margin expanded 220 basis points. Dow Building & Construction delivered double-digit volume growth with increases across all geographic areas on strong demand for our construction chemicals portfolio and STYROFOAM insulation. Here, too, our innovations are delivering as we saw continued adoption of the FR63 flame-retardant technology as well as progress with our INSTA STIK roofing adhesives and our LIQUIDARMOR flashing and sealants. 
Energy & Water Solutions continued to be impacted by headwinds in oil and gas exploration. During the quarter, our water business reached a milestone as its new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia sold its first production. This facility is targeted to meet demand in the emerging world for Dow separation technologies. I'm pleased to report that the site is already delivering our differentiated value-added products and is operating at similar rates and yield as our state-of-the-art operation in Minnesota. 
Performance Monomers' profitability improved partly due to the business' decision to reduce its merchant sales exposure. And in Dow Coating Materials, the business grew volume due to improvements in industrial and architectural coating sectors, benefiting from a strategy to broaden Dow's participation in these end markets. The business continued to broaden its product portfolio, launching 5 new vinyl acrylic binders. In equity earnings, Dow Corning's silicones delivered a double-digit earnings increase on strong volume growth. 
On Slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals increased volumes in most businesses. Polyurethanes delivered a double-digit volume increase on demand for system house applications and specialty polyols as the business continued to shift its mix into higher-value offerings. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline despite strength in the durables markets on weaker de-icer demand due to a milder winter. We also saw a notable decline in our equity earnings in the segment, consistent with our modeling guidance, from the ramp-up of Sadara spending, a change in ownership of MEGlobal and lower MEG prices. 
Performance Plastics on Slide 12 delivered a record first quarter operating EBITDA with volume gains across all businesses. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved a new record polyethylene sales volume in the quarter, driven by operational reliability and robust demand for its differentiated products. The business continued to advance its innovation agenda with new launches in several product families, including AGILITY for food packaging, INFUSE for health and hygiene and INNATE for industrial and consumer packaging. 
Gains were achieved in most geographic areas, led by North America and Asia Pacific with double-digit growth in China. Earnings grew in our Thai JVs on stronger Asian naphtha chain margins. These results were more than offset by a greater than $100 million headwind in Argentina due to our facility outage and the reduction of import barriers. Elastomers delivered earnings growth on higher demand for its differentiated technologies that enhanced the customer experience in transportation and high-performance athletic footwear. And Electrical and Telecommunications achieved double-digit volume growth on demand for infrastructure projects, subsea cable and fiber optics. 
Turning to our second quarter and full year modeling guidance on Slide 13. In the second quarter, we do expect a seasonal uptick in infrastructure, which lifts our Building & Construction, coatings and Electrical and Telecommunications businesses. In Performance Plastics, we expect year-over-year margin compression in Europe as well as reduced earnings from our position in Latin America. In Ag, we expect the market headwinds to persist. However, with our continued self-help actions, we expect the first half of 2016 to be comparable to the same period in 2015 when adjusted for the impact of divestitures. 
In 2016, we continue to bring on several earnings growth catalysts, starting with the PDH contribution, which will continue to build throughout the year. The startup of new units of Sadara will also continue. In fact, the second Solution Polyethylene train came online this month. Turnarounds and maintenance spending will be higher sequentially in the second quarter by $100 million to $150 million. We expect lower equity earnings to continue as a result of our portfolio actions and the Sadara unit startups. Turnarounds and equity earnings headwinds in the second quarter will primarily impact Performance Materials & Chemicals. And that will subside in the back half of the year. 
The Dow Corning transaction is expected to be a tailwind in the second half of the year, and we will benefit from ethane cracking enhancements in Louisiana toward the end of the year. We also see pension expense continuing to provide a tailwind. As we look ahead, we expect our operating tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the range of 23% to 27%. We expect our reported rate to fall in the 7% to 12% range in the second quarter, assuming a successful Dow Corning close. 
I'll wrap up my comments this morning with an update on the Dow Corning transaction on Slide 15. We have made significant progress toward the integration and will hit the ground running immediately following close. In the first quarter, the transaction received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS, and we have made steady progress on the regulatory front with approval from several key jurisdictions, including China, Japan and the EU. Joint integration teams composed of Dow and Dow Corning leaders have been working together since the 1st of the year to set the foundation for a successful integration. With an eye toward our post-close priorities, we established the business and the organizational structure that will lead Dow Corning in the future. The team is aligned to 3 areas of focus: delivery of the 2016 plan and the market- and technology-based growth in our key sectors, such as infrastructure, transportation and consumer care; productivity and asset management; as well as the seamless integration and realization of our cost synergies. 
I want to take a moment to talk about cost synergies and the work the team has accomplished to date, which you'll see on Slide 16. As we said in December, this transaction provides Dow an opportunity to own all of the silicones business and secure enhanced cost and growth synergies that are unique to Dow as the owner. Dow Corning silicones is a successful and thriving business that Dow helped build over the last 70-plus years. This transaction enhances our market-facing businesses with a high-quality silicones franchise and provides a catalyst for growth. It allows Dow to accelerate our narrower and deeper focus in our key value chains, including transportation, infrastructure, consumer care and electronics. 
Because we know the business so well, there is a tremendous value in the synergy capture. And here, Dow is uniquely positioned to access quick wins. The $300 million of cost synergies will focus on back-office and operational efficiencies. And we expect to achieve 100% run rate within 24 months after closing. You see here our latest estimate of how this will develop. We expect to deliver a 65% target run rate within 12 months. The team has now completed their work to validate our cost synergy target and their findings give me great confidence that we will hit our commitment. In total, we still see this transaction adding more than $1 billion in additional EBITDA for Dow on a full year basis post synergy capture. It will also be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year 1. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."
768440,331170422,966833,"The Dow Chemical Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","DuPont de Nemours, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard. Turning now to Slide 17. We continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. Here, you see our updated time line. All key deliverables remain",1065,"Thank you, Howard. Turning now to Slide 17. We continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. Here, you see our updated time line. All key deliverables remain on track. A major milestone in the quarter was the filing of the Form S-4 registration statement. And just last week, we followed up with the First Amendment. We continue to expect the S-4 will be made effective in the second quarter. Following that, both Dow and DuPont will set the date for our respective special meetings for shareholders to vote on the merger. The second major milestone in the quarter was our formation of a Joint Implementation Management Office or Joint IMO, which is driving the integration process across the 2 companies. And the third milestone was both companies jointly engaging McKinsey, who has assisted many other companies through large successful integrations. 
Turning to Slide 18. With oversight from the Joint Executive Steering Committee, the Joint IMO is developing execution-ready plans to ensure that we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as 3 independent divisions as soon as possible post close. The clear objective of the Joint IMO, which Rick Olson from DuPont and I co-lead, is speed of execution, speed to close, speed to capture the synergies and speed to spin. The team is squarely focused on that mission. Soon after forming the Joint IMO, we commissioned multiple subteams focused on a diversity of work streams, from governance to stand-up and separation activities to sourcing and purchasing. There have already been numerous joint planning meetings between the 2 companies. Plans are progressing well, and we continue to make significant progress to realize the vision for the merger and the subsequent intended spins. 
One of the key deliverables for this team is an execution-ready playbook to achieve our greater than $3 billion synergy target. In this space, we've already done considerable benchmarking to validate our targets. We followed a rigorous process coordinated by McKinsey to provide objectivity and external validation for our assumptions. We compared various financial metrics for the intended spins against best-in-class peers. We did this across businesses and functions. This independent benchmarking yielded a similar answer as the joint working session our companies held prior to announcing the merger. This is just one of the reasons why we feel even more confident in the target and the opportunity in front of us. 
We're equally excited about our near-term earnings growth drivers, which are on Slide 20. In March, our PDH plant successfully completed the performance test and achieved full run rates less than 2 months after startup. The unit recently went down for plant maintenance and will begin ramping back up next week. We made significant progress on the construction of our Louisiana flexibility project, which is now 95% complete. And in Texas, our Texas-9 cracker is 50% complete with more than 80% of the equipment installed. In Saudi Arabia, we have started our second polyethylene plant on purchased ethylene and have proven several of the major cracker components. We continue to move forward with the startup of this impressive site and expect those activities to accelerate as we proceed through the year. And our multiyear productivity push continues to deliver bottom line results. 
Let's now take a moment to discuss our outlook for the plastics and feedstocks markets, starting with polyethylene on Slide 21. Some are projecting much looser balances for the second half of the year and into next year. The main point of disagreement that we have with consultant projections is the speed in which new U.S. projects are brought online as well as assumptions about projects in Asia and the Middle East, which we find overly optimistic. If you look at history, you will see that industry supply projections are almost always higher than what is achieved due to project cancellations, construction delays and labor constraints. For example, in 2007, supply projections for 2012 were about 6 world-scale ethylene crackers higher than what became reality. We generally agree on the demand projections in these scenarios, which rest on sustainable urbanization in the developing world. 10 years ago, China's per capita use of polyethylene was roughly 1/5 of the United States. Today, it's half and this trend will continue. Our view is highlighted in the chart on the right. If you overlay more realistic assumptions about the ability of the industry to bring new facilities online, we see sustainably high rates of ethylene and polyethylene utilization for the next several years. 
In this environment, we believe that lasting value creation comes from participating in the entire plastics value chain, as outlined on Slide 22. The dynamics across the chain can shift significantly over time. The long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, geographic diversification, innovation and differentiation. No one rivals Dow on this front. And our results have shown this time and time again. 
First, we believe the value of our advantaged feedstock positions will grow. Feedstock flexibility remains one of our signature advantages of Dow's cracker fleet. This, combined with our European LPG capabilities and U.S. PDH, form structural hedges for the exposure to frac spread pressures. And we continue to see ethane and propane balances being favorable for some time. We have given our updated outlooks for these in the appendix. Bottom line, our view hasn't changed. We see plenty of NGLs available for the new crackers based on continued growth and gas demand. 
Second, European and Asian naphtha cracker margins will continue to reflect tight conditions as underlying demand surpasses realized supply while the U.S. ethylene balance will be somewhat looser. Third, polyethylene over ethylene margins are likely to remain solid as polyethylene capacity additions lag ethylene expansions, especially in the U.S. The key point here is that it's consumer demand that drives the market balances. And finally, the value of Dow's differentiation should grow. We've proven the value of our customer intimacy and our differentiated portfolio time and again. We are the innovator for the packaging, elastomers and electrical and telecommunications industries. And that, coupled with our new capacities in Sadara and the U.S. Gulf Coast, drives growth and advantaged results. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew."

In short, we expect to see continued consumer-driven demand around much of the world. We see strong demand signals in North America, gradual recovery in Europe and ongoing consumer-led demand growth in China, all of which are driving the need for Dow's unique products, underscoring our innovation, market access and integration, enabling us to deliver value in our selected market sectors. We saw this in the quarter in the performance of our Building & Construction, Elastomers, Automotive and Electronic Materials businesses, where our smart-sized scale enabled us to produce high-margin, technology-rich solutions faster and to commercialize them more quickly in the key sectors these businesses serve and grow faster than smaller-sized competitors. 
We believe that pockets of volatility will persist, including near-term geopolitical and economic uncertainty, most notably in Brazil. Supply surpluses will continue in agriculture and energy. This outlook is what we've seen these last many years, and we expect slow economic growth and high volatility to continue in the near term. Going forward, we will continue managing what we can control. We've shown we can grow earnings and volume in this environment. Using a narrower and deeper market focus, targeted innovation and our exceptional low-cost and integrated position in the value chain, the Dow business model has outperformed its peers in the last several years. Despite a mixed market outlook, we believe we can continue to do so. 
If you turn to Slide 25, I'll end the call today by reiterating that we remain squarely aligned around 3 clear priorities this year. Priority one, deliver our 2016 plan. As the quarter showed, we are delivering and will continue to do so. Priority two, close the Dow Corning transaction. As Howard said, we are ready to implement and have clear targets in place to meet or exceed expectations. And priority three, move swiftly through the key steps of the DowDuPont transaction. As you heard from Jim, we are on track and will continue to see the $3 billion in projected cost synergies as the floor. And we are driven by the mantra, speed to close, speed to spin. 
Our team has clear goals and a resolute focus on achieving them. Our unique combination of differentiation and integration, coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda is delivering results. Our broad geographic footprint and relentless productivity mindset will serve us well in the face of volatility and regional and market headwinds. The Dow team is building momentum towards the integration of the Dow Corning silicones business, the creation of DowDuPont and the ultimate creation of the new materials co, to be named Dow, a growth company with a winning portfolio. These once-in-a-generation transactions, further bolstered by our near-term growth drivers and our relentless focus on execution, will enable new levels of value creation for our customers and generate even greater returns for our shareholders. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

So if you could just tell us what sort of -- within those views of NGL pricing, what sort of natural gas and crude oil pricing assumptions do you have? So that's one part of it. And the second part is that, in my mind, obviously part of the continued strength within Performance Plastics was lower NGL prices. But the other part was a rebound in ethylene prices. So could you also tell us who right now is setting the price for ethylene? Is it MTO?"

We believe that gas is really going to be very well supplied over this 5-year horizon. And I think in most cases, gas remains sub-$3, maybe it runs between $3 and $4, depending on where oil price goes. Our other view",322,"Yes, Hassan, thanks for the question. We believe that gas is really going to be very well supplied over this 5-year horizon. And I think in most cases, gas remains sub-$3, maybe it runs between $3 and $4, depending on where oil price goes. Our other view is at $50 to $60 a barrel oil, the NGL supply is going to expand significantly in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. So when you combine that with the fact that the crackers' completion schedule and their RTO horizon is stretching out, and that spreads that NGL demand intensity out, and that's reflected in what we put in the appendix. Ethane export starts up this year, but that growth is slow. And propane competition right now is acting as a cracker -- as a ceiling for the prices at the cracker level. In fact, it's back into the site. And if you look at first quarter, ethane and propane were kind of in at even tradeoff in the cracker slate. So we think the outlook for NGLs for all these projects is going to be just fine. And then we'll continue to have a favorable balance there, and you'll see that in the oil and gas ratios as well. As far as ethylene, ethylene moved up $0.05 in March. And I think a little bit of that is some bounce-back in volume demand. As you could see from our own results, volume growth is good there and you also see some impacts of different outages around the world, some planned, some unplanned. Look, I'm not a believer yet in this whole theory that MTO is setting the pricing out there. I think demand is setting the pricing. MTO may be a factor in some commodity grades of ethylene, polyethylene in China. But for most of the marketplace, I think you've also got a very, very competitive U.S. Gulf Coast situation that's helped setting that price."

I would say right now, the inventories in most of these chains are very balanced. I'll use plastics as an example, where I can give you some specific data. We had 37 days. The industry had 37 days of inventory in North America going into the big turnaround season here. And that is really a tight inventory position. And we obviously are at that level or slightly below that as we head in. And operating rates have been very high. So I don't think in any of these businesses, you're going to see the units in inventory be very high. You have some working capital impacts from the changes on accounts receivable and payable because of what's happened with the revenue line. But on a units basis, things remain balanced and relatively low for this time in the year. We have turnarounds coming up in Q2, but we're going to be coming out of those with tight inventories and the ability to still run hard."

I'll talk about our performance, and then we'll talk about the peers next. First, on plastics, I think one of the things that is not evident just at the high level on the numbers is we had about $100 million headwind from Latin America. And it was a combination of currencies and obviously the changes that happened in Argentina as they removed duties and opened up. So people won't see that in terms of the high-level numbers. In Europe, we saw strong business in Europe, just as you mentioned, and I don't think our view there is any different than our peers. When you look at Performance Materials & Chemicals, I'd say that delta is 50-50. And if you look at Polyurethanes in Performance Materials & Chemicals, they're carrying the burden this year of the higher start-up cost of Sadara. So you have to -- on a run rate basis, you have to think about where they will be next year. And [indiscernible]  also got some commodity price pressures in some parts of the chain, mostly in isocyanates right now. And then in Industrial Solutions, Howard mentioned that we actually -- with the step-down on MEGlobal and also the lower MEG prices, that hits Industrial Solutions earnings. So if you look about at Industrial Solutions, how they did year-over-year, that's carrying that step-down in MEGlobal and MEG prices and also a de-icing season that was 50% lighter than it was last year and the weight of oil and gas sectors. Some of the EO Derivatives go into the oil and gas sector and they're carrying that. So I think that explains really most of our own performance. On peer comparisons, you have to adjust for 1x in portfolio differences, so divestiture sales, and then the portfolio difference. Some of our peers are heavy into polypropylene. And of course, we don't play in that space. When you take those things out and put it on an apples-to-apples basis, I think you'll see that it's a slight beat there."

Look, I've just been in both Europe and Asia, specifically Japan and China. I would tell you the low oil price phenomena is seeping through to the consumer economy in both places actually as oil importers. And that's been a sustained trend now for several quarters. You're seeing consumption increase. And then double down on our products that we supply, some of the very specialty products that we have downstream, these are products that the Chinas and the Europes need, whether it be lightweight materials for cars or whether it be building insulation for energy-efficient buildings. On and on, our innovation agenda is working in those economies. So we're seeing sustainable volumes because we can actually sell out asset and sell up asset. And it's that combination, Jim had it on Slide, I think, 22, that shows that we can make money at different parts of -- in his particular case, he referenced the plastics business. So we think that's detaching itself from that oil number quite substantially. In fact, Frank, if you've seen our 14 quarters in a row and 10 quarters in a row of volume increase, if you see how that volume increase is made up, it's mixed. And it's mixed under -- if you look at the extremes of oil price, we've had oil price as high as $120 in that full year period and oil price as low as in the high 20s in that same period, yet we've grown volume through sustained execution of products people need.

I think the back half, you're going to see that tighten up a bit more, and then into 2017. So those 2 factors, I think from our view, are going to continue to drive the availability of those NGLs."

In general on polyethylene capacity and supply/demand, one of the things you have to bear in mind with these numbers is there's a wide range of interpretation on them. In these assets, you make a mix of products, and they can swing those operating rates 2% to 3% pretty easily. So a flat line like you see there in 2016, '17, '18 at any given point in time could be moving up. Our point is that you don't see any big dip downward in polyethylene operating rates coming in front of us. And even we, right now, have been running well above those operating rates for a considerable period of time to generate the kind of volume growth that we've been generating. I could, in fact, use 2 new trains coming up in Sadara to feed the commercial organization because they're screaming for more product."

You've seen a little bit come back to support Shell. Obviously, Port of Megera came back up to support Shell. The other thing is the shift towards LPG cracking on our side. We've shifted to a very high percent of LPG cracking and we continue to look at opportunities to make small incremental investments to expand that.

We're off to a strong start to the year, which is continuing the 3.5 year streak of earnings growth, managing all sorts of environments. That's coming because we, firstly, have targeted growth and the portfolio is built for this environment. The diversification works. And frankly, we are finding growth where growth is and we're seeing great numbers coming out of our various regions and end-use markets, whether it be China, here in the U.S. or even in Europe. We're benefiting from strong margin management and a strong focus on ROC. And then that's the next point I want to make. The U.S. and Chinese markets are strong markets and we have strong outlooks there. We can continue to grow margin in those markets under these environments because we do have the product mix. And that last question on Europe means we have the feedstock flex to keep making margins in a recovering Europe. U.S., Europe and China being strong for us is something we've now seen for a while and is continuing to build momentum. And then the 2 transactions, both Howard and Jim outlined it, the questions were asked on the transactions. We are moving towards these transactions becoming a reality. And we're planning very strongly to execute the synergies and execute them and lean into them and execute them quickly and execute them. So in the case of the DowDuPont transaction, we move to the spins as fast as we can. In the case of the Dow Corning transaction, so that we integrate. Howard's numbers of $300 million of cost synergies and $100 million of growth, just to remind you, it's about 8% of revenue. We did double-digit percentage of revenues on synergies on both Carbide and Rohm and Haas. So we have a strong record of executing the synergy targets that we will talk about. We'll have a lot more to say about DowDuPont and the specifics on that in ensuing calls as we go towards the S-4 registration, and of course, the shareholder meetings on both sides. Both Ed and I are very dedicated to delivering the 3 and 1 [ph]: $3 billion of costs, $1 billion of growth as a floor. So with that, Neal, I'll turn it back to you."

If you turn to Slide 3, and good morning, everyone. Let me open the review of the quarter by stepping back and just looking at our 3 simple and very focused goals of the year: first one, achieve our plans; Second one, close Dow Corning",578,"Thank you, Neal. If you turn to Slide 3, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me open the review of the quarter by stepping back and just looking at our 3 simple and very focused goals of the year: first one, achieve our plans; Second one, close Dow Corning by mid-year; and third, drive the merger milestones with DuPont for a year-end close. Simple, clear, and focused. 
Let's start with the plan. Dow's relentless and disciplined execution once again delivered another quarter of operating earnings growth and margin expansion. And the Dow team has again done it through a variety of challenge and geopolitical and market conditions and outpacing our peers in the process. You can see that in our results, 15 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion, 11 consecutive quarters of volume growth. Notably, we delivered gains in all geographies, with particular strength in the United States, China and Europe. Cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion, up nearly 60% versus the year-ago period. 
We are focused on every aspect of the P&L and balance sheet to deliver these numbers with weekly operations meanings and very strong self-help actions. Our unique combination of world-class innovation, diversified integration and a narrow and deeper market focus enabled operating earnings growth in every business in our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions segments, while the strength of our Plastics franchise was again on display. 
We have built our portfolio to grow both the top and bottom line, even though market and economic conditions remained challenging. In those markets that are challenged, we have been implementing proactive and targeted self-help measures. You can see this in our Ag segment, where our actions have generated earnings year-to-date that have outperformed the industry downturn. Another example is our recent restructuring announcement related to the Dow Corning transaction, which will reduce headcount by an additional 700 positions on top of the Dow Corning synergies to a total of 2,500 and accelerated earnings growth under these volatile market conditions. Howard will review our results in more granularity in a moment, but the income and cash flow results are truly noteworthy. 
Our second goal is, indeed, to close Dow Corning and its ownership restructuring, where we're bringing a new element for growth and technology platform that will to further drive Dow's focus and an attractive targeted market segments as well as enhance the earnings power of the new Dow. Soon after closing, we will also increase our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million. When combined with the estimated $100 million of growth synergies, we see a total of $500 million of synergies from this transaction. We achieved this goal ahead of schedule on June 1, and I'm happy to report that the integration has proceeded seamlessly. 
And on our third goal, we recently received overwhelming approval with the historic DowDuPont transaction from our shareholders, illustrating the market's recognition of this unique opportunity to deliver value to all stakeholders as we drive the intended separation into 3 independent, leading size-based [ph] companies that will redefine their respective industries. Simply put, the Dow team is sharply focused on driving our 3 goals, and this quarter's report shows the results of this effort. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard to cover highlights from the quarter and an update on Dow Corning. Jim will then give an update on our Plastics franchise and DowDuPont. And I'll close with our outlook and earnings growth drivers. Howard?"

On Slide 5, Dow's financial performance had several noteworthy highlights in the second quarter. The team delivered operating EPS of $0.95 a share despite the slow growth and certain macroeconomic environment. The Dow team found pockets of growth in all of our major geographies, and we kept our focus on driving further productivity gains, adding another $90 million of savings in the quarter, bringing our first half savings to $180 million, tracking well above our 2016 target of $300 million. 
Our innovative products and solutions are also winning in the marketplace. Many of our businesses highlighted market share gains and new business wins, as evidenced by our continued volume and margin growth in the quarter. Our overall operating EBITDA margin rose more than 160 basis points to 21%, our highest second quarter margin in a decade, led by gains in Consumer and Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics. 
We also achieved multiple records in the quarter, including EBITDA records in Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics and the sales volume record in Performance Plastics, all of which helped the team deliver an $800 million increase in cash flow from operations in the quarter.
Taking a longer view, the progress we've made over the past 4 years has enabled us to significantly grow EPS above our target of 10% annual growth. They continue to increase free cash flow generation while fueling our future growth through targeted investments and, at the same time, return $14 billion through our shareholders through share buybacks and paid dividends. 
Now turning to our segment results on Slide 6. Let's start with Ag. We're delivering despite high industry Crop Protection inventories, currency headwinds and low crop commodity prices. Our Ag team continues to respond with targeted self-help actions that have largely offset the headwinds while maintaining the long-term growth potential of our franchise. In the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth in corn seeds, but that was more than offset by soft demand in sunflower and soybeans. Crop Protection volume was lower, primarily due to reduced generic herbicide demand and the impact of the AgroFresh divestiture. 
For the year, we see the market declining 5% on robust deals in North America, high inventories and low crop prices. In the second half of 2016, Crop Protection volume is expected to be flat, with modest pricing pressure due to lower demand for insecticides and generic herbicides, and we expect some positives in seeds, as the Latin America season outlook improves. 
On Slide 7, Consumer Solutions continues to deliver impressive results, achieving record EBITDA of $341 million. Earnings increased in all businesses on market share gains, new business wins and robust demand for our innovative products.
Dow Automotive achieved record second quarter EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, driven by strong demand for light-weighting and sound dampening technologies and benefited from greater production of SUVs and trucks, which contained more Dow content. 
Consumer Care recorded higher earnings, led by double-digit volume growth in personal care applications, solid demand in home core sectors and market share gains. 
Dow Electronic Materials delivered double-digit EBITDA growth on share gains in the semiconductor and display end markets. 
And our newly integrated Consumer Solutions silicones business captured greater market share on strong demand in the consumer care sector, notably, in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
On Slide 8, Infrastructure Solutions also reported EBITDA growth in every business. Dow Building and Construction delivered a record quarterly EBITDA and saw a volume growth in most geographies on strong demand for its construction chemicals, spray foam insulation and continued adoption of our blue edge technology. 
In Energy and Water Solutions, self-help actions mitigated persistent energy headwinds as oil and gas exploration project demand remains low. Water fundamentals, however, remained robust. Our new Saudi RO membrane plant is at full rates, positioning us well to meet demand in emerging geographies. 
We also saw improvement in Performance Monomers, reflecting our aggressive self-help measures, including our purposeful reduction in merchant sales exposure. 
Dow Coating Materials grew volume in all sectors, and our new vinyl acrylic binders are enabling share gains and diversification into value-add applications. 
Finally, our new Infrastructure Solutions Silicones business saw strong demand in the construction sector, enabling higher first half EBITDA. 
On Slide 9, Performance Materials & Chemicals had several moving parts in the quarter. Equity earnings were over $100 million lower, consistent with our modeling guidance, due to the change in ownership of MEGlobal, coupled with lower energy prices and Sadara startup costs. 
When you take into account these 2 items, the core Polyurethanes business performed well, as it continued to increasingly tilt for its higher-value specialty portfolio. The business delivered double-digit volume growth in its systems houses on strong consumer demand, particularly in Asia Pacific, enabled by our new polyols plant in Thailand. This benefit, however, was offset by margin compression in the upstream portion of the business, where supply balances have loosened and turnaround and maintenance costs were higher due to planned outage in Europe and a short unplanned outage in Brazil. 
And Industrial Solutions, putting the impacts on equity earnings to one side, our core business delivered flat earnings, as disciplined self-help actions offset challenging industrial end market conditions. 
Turning to Performance Plastics on Slide 10. Reported record second quarter EBITDA with volume gains across most businesses in all geographies. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved several second quarter records, including EBITDA and sales volume, enabled by operational excellence, reflecting an aligned team focused on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment. Additionally, the business recovered margin in Latin America on demand and growth. 
Dow Elastomers volume increases from strong demand for its innovative technologies in automotive, hot-melt adhesives and athletic footwear were balanced by the impact of production from a higher turnaround activity in the quarter. 
Dow Electronics -- Electrical and Telecommunications delivered volume growth across all geographies, led by double-digit gains in the Americas on continued demand for fiber optic, coax and jacketing solutions. 
Turning now to Slide 12. As Andrew stated, our teams successfully closed to the ownership addressing of Dow Corning in June. As we worked together more closely with the Dow Corning team, we discovered even more opportunities to streamline, giving us the confidence to increase our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million, with 1,800 role reductions directly related to Dow Corning. We expect to achieve a 70% run rate within 12 months of closing and the full cost synergy run rate within 24 months. The growth synergies of $100 million will be captured within 36 months. This transaction will unlock significant value for Dow shareholders, and it is expected to be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year 1. And at full synergy run rate, it is expected to add greater than $1 billion of EBITDA to our bottom line. 
Finally, in order to leave ample time for Q&A at the end of the call, we have included our usual modeling guidance slide in the appendix of the deck. 
I'll now turn it over to Jim."

I'll start with [indiscernible] growth lever, our Plastics franchise. The dynamics across the polyethylene chain can shift significantly over time and is critical to remain agile and adaptive with this industry. The long-term winters",581,"Thank you, Howard. I'll start with [indiscernible] growth lever, our Plastics franchise. 
The dynamics across the polyethylene chain can shift significantly over time and is critical to remain agile and adaptive with this industry. The long-term winters are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, diversification and differentiation and global reach. And our results have shown that Dow does this exceptionally well time and time again, maximizing our returns while reducing our long-term earnings volatility. As value in the chain shifts over time, our direct-to-customer intimacy, innovation and application development and technical support differentiate our earnings unlike all of our competitors. 
On Slide 15, I'll go through our polyethylene view. Consistent with the view that we've held since the beginning of the year, we see polyethylene balances remaining stable over the next few years. Demand growth continues globally, as consumers expect higher food safety standards, better sustainability at plastic packaging relative to the alternatives and improvements in packaging functionality and convenience that polyethylene provides. On the ethylene supply side, our view takes into account that the leading industry consultants forecast capacity additions that overstate what actually gets built. We saw this play out just a few years ago. 
And we think that incremental delays and project postponements will happen once again. In fact, we've already seen evidence of this. 
We believe that both ethylene and polyethylene rates will remain high globally, and we continue to expect higher operating rates in polyethylene than in ethylene. And as we seen this year, there may be some regional differences. 
Earlier this year, some called for a very weak condition in the second half of the year. We did not hold that view. And today, margins remain a firm globally, and inventories are below average. I will state once again that we see continuing good conditions with expected seasonality over the next few years. 
In this environment, the Sadara additions will position us well to capture growth where growth exists. That 26 units at this worldscale facility, the largest of its kind ever built in a single phase, continue to come online. We're in a ramp and startup activity right now. We have qualified 25 polyethylene products to date and have shipped polyethylene from the first 2 trains to nearly 100 customers in more than 25 countries. The multi-feed cracker is now in the early phases of startup, and we expect commercial operation in the third quarter. All construction at the Sadara site should be completed by year-end, with commissioning thereafter. We are happy with the progress made to date and will continue to provide updates as we get closer to year-end. 
I'll leave my comments with DowDuPont on Slide 16. We continue to make significant progress on the transaction and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. All key deliverables remain on track, and just last week, both companies received overwhelming support from our respective shareholders to approve the merger. We continue to focus on preparations for day 1, developing the financials for the intended spend and also driving the regulatory approval process. As I've said before, the vast majority of Dow people are focused on day-to-day business results, and our teams are doing a great job of making sure these transactions do not take away from our sharp focus to deliver the 2016 financial plan. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew for our outlook and earnings drivers."

Our earnings growth drivers are very visible to us, clearly definable and will be appearing in our bottom line results over these next few years. Just to remind you, from 2012 to 2015, Dow has delivered an EPS growth CAGR of 22% per year based on an intervention mindset on productivity and portfolio management, aggressive self-help actions, if you like. During this time, our R&D and innovation agenda delivered new products and technologies and upgrading our margin from 13% to 20% in the same period and growing core volumes on average 2% per year. As you can see from this quarter's results, we are at a $10 billion EBITDA run rate. Building from 2015's results and adding our specific actions, interventions and projects, we grow the new Dow's EBITDA post [indiscernible] spin to greater than $15 billion of EBITDA and 25% EBITDA margin. You can see here what we count: productivity premerger; the U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara investments at steady run rate; the Dow Corning transaction; and the Dow DuPont transaction, which are materials synergy targets of $1.5 billion; plus Dow's Performance Materials business, minus Dow's Agricultural Sciences and Electronic Materials business. Note that we do not count any growth synergies, any market organic growth or any new innovation contribution. These new earnings streams are in motion and are known to us and described to you. And we will do all of this in a market and global economy that is mixed at best. Our outlook is that this won't change. Volatility and macro uncertainties are the new norm. But Dow will deliver, as it has these many years, by firmly executing against our earnings growth drivers. And we will continue to grow earnings before, during and after the merger and its intended spins. We have the team to do so. We have not been, nor will we be, distracted in delivering value for our shareholders. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

So hopeful that we're seeing a rebound in the developing economies right now. And our operating EBITDA is up 7% versus same quarter last year. Compared to previous quarter, pricing is up. Compared to same quarter last year, pricing's off [ph] about $0.01. So I think you're seeing that reflected, the polyethylene price reflects that robust demand. And then my point on inventories, I mean, the derivative demand is much tighter than the ethylene demand, and we think that's going to remain the case. And in fact, we continue to see announcements of projects light out of the pipeline. I reflected that in my comments. We continue to see delays forecasted, later start-ups, projects being completely taken out of the forecast for ethylene. But I think, to your point, about back half of the year, I think you're going to see more of the same than you have seen. We see a little bit of seasonality toward the end of the year, typically.

And I think we're going to continue to see Latin America come back. Obviously, the impact of the lower GDP has a little bit of a market sentimental impact on what happens with the consumer market. But when you look at the currency impacts in Latin America and, for that matter, in most of the developing world, most of the inflationary impacts, as those currency changes, have already been felt. And that's, I think, what leads into our comments that, we think, in the emerging geographies, we're seeing a bottom and, hopefully, a recovery from this point on. Meanwhile, the United States, given the energy feedstock competitiveness, is still one of the lowest-cost places in the world to make these products. And so we still have the ability to export based on our global reach to all parts of the world. And based on the fact that w are focusing on the higher-value end markets, where most of the new capacity is coming on in the really highly commoditized segment, it gives us the added benefit of the power of innovation. So when you look at that power of innovation and the competitiveness of scale that we have, I think we're well positioned to take advantage of this whole market situation. Relative to your point on our timing, our Sadara plants are up, and the cracker is in the startup phase right now. In fact, the systems are running. And we're in the phase right before you really bring on the rest of the furnaces. We got things inventoried in the hydrocarbons units, and we're drying out the rest of the plant and getting ready to go. So you're going to see polyethylene running here. And our hope is that polyethylene turns favorable, more of a tailwind for the plastics business in the back half of the year. U.S. Gulf Coast, the cracker project is making tremendous progress. I think we're well above the 70% completion rate. And as we said, we're going to have that up by mid next year. And the polyethylene plants are coming along very nicely. I was just down in [indiscernible] last month, and I've been down at Texas the last couple of months. And we're making tremendous progress on those. So I think our timing is very consistent with every previous report we've given you on those plants."

So when we get to the next administration and we engage, we'll engage on all the things that matter to the company, notably, trade. Just a little reminder because I've been asked this question a few times, just a little reminder that the United States has actually put in very few trade agreements in the last 10 years, actually, 3 specific bilats and one multi-lats in the works but not yet done. So I will tell you we haven't really been exposed to the positives of trade, and most of it is because the way Jim answered the other question, which is we're on the ground pretty much everywhere else. And so regionalization, the sum of all places you're in, which is 37 countries for Dow. We're on the ground with physical facility in 37 countries means we have a local market access under all sorts of trade environments. And there are a great trade agreements going on between Asian countries and European Union and elsewhere. So we benefit from all of those. I would like to see the U.S. get to a multi-lat trade agreement, TPP, but we're not counting on it. I think what we're going to see here is a lot of uncertainties in the political environment. And I grew up in Asia, where there were trade barriers everywhere. So Dow has the strategy to operate and generate profit in economies that grow wherever there is growth. And we have the diversification of geographic mix to take a few countries being on the Dow side growth, i.e, like Brazil right now, and of course, manage the upside and like the U.S. and China right now.

And look, we still believe that automotive this year is going to have a production level that's above last year even if it's just slightly above, and sales continue to be strong there. We've always had the leading supply in glass binding. So that business continues to perform exceptionally well. And the addition of crash durable adhesives, I can't underestimate how much of a growth driver that is for this business. Not just in -- I mean, we've highlighted our experience with Ford in the F150, where we're bonding aluminum to a steel structure. And not just light-weighting the vehicle, but improving the crash safety rating of that vehicle, a class of vehicles, is not known for high crash safety ratings. But that applies in other dissimilar materials or whether you're talking about carbon fiber composites on a steel frame, that application still applies. And as we continue to see others focus on light-weighting and our driving force in automotive has been and continues to be free cash flow of the design table with this brand owners.

All those metrics, where line to implement speed to close, speed to energy, speed to spin. And those details, granular details, with a powerful shareholder approval we got last week, over 97% of approval in our case and in DuPont's case, this is just an indicator. This is a lot of EBITDA that's, come at both the merged company and then the split -- the intended spins.

Jim allude sort of this point earlier in the call that over the last couple of months, we've sort of seen and heard a fair degree of cynicism around ethylene supply demand fundamentals.

I think it's a very good question, Hassan, and it's the reason we put that in the back of the deck. I'm glad you looked at that. I think, a couple of things. Obviously, on the demand side for ethane, my comments about what's happening with project delays and things sliding, the timing impact a little bit of that demand picture. But the power of feedstock flexibility here is what we always talk about in Dow. And one of the reasons we invest the way that we do is propane and natural play a big role in this 2. So propane right now is capping ethane and the other dynamic that you see happening is that probe and exports out of the U.S. are really flooding and exhausting some of the available buyers that are in that market. And natural gas prices are low. And the supply, even with the rig counts down, the supply has continued to be very strong. And now we're starting to see recounts pick up a little bit. So our view here is that despite the exports, despite all the other things happening, you're still going to be long propane and ethane. And you're going to be longer in that gas and propane than you are ethane. And when you're long propane and propanes in the crack slate, that's advantaged out. And so that's what we play for. Obviously, we have the flexibility to go back and ethane when that's possible. But look, there's more gas supply at low cost that coming on every day, not just in the U.S It's coming on in the Middle East. It's in Australia. It's putting pressure on these gas prices and that's what I help us out."

And I just want to add a comment there because it enables us to repeat the 15 quarters in a row of EPS growth year-on-year has come under oil environments at $100 and oil environments at low $30. And there's been corrections out there because the view is that the basis of your question, Hassan, is that, in some way, where naphtha is versus ethane, where naphtha is versus propane, is linked to where oil is versus gas. And what we have seen and what Steve said and what we've now performed against under these diverse environments is, firstly, our geographic mix helps us. Secondly, our feedstock flexibility enables us. Thirdly, we've added to that flexibility, i.e. propane in Europe or a great example of that. We see propane as long as far as the eye can see. And lastly and very importantly, low oil price, over time, has enabled consumer demand. It took a while, but it's here. U.S. consumers are spending because they've got more money in their pockets. That's also happening in countries like China, which is becoming more consumer-led. So a low oil price with the enablement of feedstock on the Dow side, with ethane, propane, some butane, certainly in the U.S. and our feedstock in Europe means we can maximize profits in the chain that keeps slide that Jim has in his deck. We can make money as long as the demand -- there is demand. The feedstock input/output thing, we're managing to maximize profit maximize margins, which is a price volume trade-off in that chain. And we're doing it successfully now under oil environments."

I'd like to pick up on Hassan's question and go a little forward and been into the company's strong performance in the quarter. As [indiscernible] 15 quarters in a row, Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions and plastics performed, and they performed in tangent with a consumer-led economy. We have the portfolio to keep performing and keep strong performance, but we're not resting there. Self-help actions for the last many years on reducing costs, taking productivity to the bottom line, keeping it sticky. The 2,500 positions we're reducing, i.e. the 700 extra on top of the Dow Corning announcement is a great example of how we continue to work to the cost engine, not just feedstock, but actual costs, so that we can stay in the margin expansion mode, now 15 in a row. This is not only I know that margin but the working capital side of things. Given a look at what we've done. We produced 1 billion more pounds in the quarter from a year ago, 2 billion pounds more from the same machine from the first half point of view. Those extra pounds, and that's high operating rate, and disciplined working capital is generating this extra free cash flow that will feed the share buyback question that Howard answer. And we're very committed, working capital management, cash flow management, free cash flow generation to keep working the balance sheet so that we can increase your buybacks. And then the strong demand environment will continue. Look, it's not a great global economy, but it's a consumer-led economy and our product speak to it. And our new plants will come online at the right time. So all of our interventions are producing and continue to produce. Dow Corning, accretive in the first month synergies raise already. The merger on track, and with a great see-through to these 3 new entities, these 3 great growth entities. We're firing on all cylinders, and we will continue to do so."

If you turn to Slide 3 -- and good morning, everyone. 
Let me open the review of the quarter by stepping back and just looking at our 3 simple and very focused goals of the year: first one, achieve our plans; second one, close Dow Corning by mid-year; and third, drive the merger milestones with DuPont for a year-end close -- simple, clear, and focused. 
Let's start with the plan. Dow's relentless and disciplined execution once again delivered another quarter of operating earnings growth and margin expansion. And the Dow team has again done it through a variety of challenging geopolitical and market conditions and outpacing our peers in the process. You can see that in our results: 15 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion, 11 consecutive quarters of volume growth. Notably, we delivered gains in all geographies, with particular strength in the United States, China and Europe. Cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion, up nearly 60% versus the year-ago period. 
We are focused on every aspect of the P&L and balance sheet to deliver these numbers with weekly operations meeting and very strong self-help actions. Our unique combination of world-class innovation, diversified integration and a narrow and deeper market focus enabled operating earnings growth in every business in our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions segments, while the strength of our Plastics franchise was again on display. 
We have built Dow's portfolio to grow both the top and bottom line, even though market and economic conditions remained challenging. In those markets that are challenged, we have been implementing proactive and targeted self-help measures. You can see this in our Ag segment, where our actions have generated earnings year-to-date that have outperformed the industry downturn. Another example is our recent restructuring announcement related to the Dow Corning transaction, which will reduce headcount by an additional 700 positions on top of the Dow Corning synergies to a total of 2,500 and accelerated earnings growth under these volatile market conditions. Howard will review our results in more granularity in a moment, but the income and cash flow results are truly noteworthy. 
Our second goal is, indeed, to close Dow Corning and its ownership restructuring, where we're bringing a new element for growth in powerful technology platform that will further drives Dow's focus in an attractive targeted market segments as well as enhance the earnings power of the new Dow. Soon after closing, we also increased our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million. When combined with the estimated $100 million of growth synergies, we see a total of $500 million of synergies from this transaction. We achieved this goal ahead of schedule on June 1, and I'm happy to report that the integration has proceeded seamlessly. 
And on our third goal, we recently received overwhelming approval with a historic DowDuPont transaction from our shareholders, illustrating the market's recognition of this unique opportunity to deliver value to all stakeholders, as we drive the intended separation into 3 independent, leading science-based companies that will redefine their respective industries. Simply put, the Dow team is sharply focused on driving our 3 goals, and this quarter's report shows the results of this effort. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard to cover highlights from the quarter and an update on Dow Corning. Jim will then give an update on our Plastics franchise and DowDuPont. And I'll close with our outlook and earnings growth drivers. Howard?"

On Slide 5, Dow's financial performance had several noteworthy highlights in the second quarter. The team delivered operating EPS of $0.95 a share, despite the slow growth in uncertain macroeconomic environment. The Dow team found pockets of growth in all of our major geographies, and we kept our focus on driving further productivity gains, adding another $90 million of savings in the quarter, bringing our first half savings to $180 million, tracking well above our 2016 target of $300 million. 
Our innovative products and solutions are also winning in the marketplace. Many of our businesses highlighted market share gains and new business wins as evidenced by our continued volume and margin growth in the quarter. 
Our overall operating EBITDA margin rose more than 160 basis points to 21%, our highest second quarter margin in a decade, led by gains in Consumer and Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics. 
We also achieved multiple records in the quarter, including EBITDA records in Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics, and a sales volume record in Performance Plastics, all of which helped the team deliver an $800 million increase in cash flow from operations in the quarter.
Taking a longer view, the progress we've made over the past 4 years has enabled us to significantly grow EPS above our target of 10% annual growth. We continue to increase free cash flow generation, while fueling our future growth through targeted investments, and at the same time returned $14 billion through our shareholders through share buybacks and pay dividends. 
Now turning to our segment results on Slide 6, let's start with Ag. We're delivering despite high industry Crop Protection inventories, currency headwinds and low crop commodity prices, our Ag team continues to respond with targeted self-help actions that have largely offset the headwinds, while maintaining the long-term growth potential of our franchise. In the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth in corn seeds, but that was more than offset by soft demand in sunflower and soybeans. Crop Protection volume was lower, primarily due to reduced generic herbicide demand and the impact of the AgroFresh divestiture. 
For the year, we see the market declining 5% on robust yields in North America, high inventories and low crop prices. In the second half of 2016, Crop Protection volume is expected to be flat, with modest pricing pressure due to lower demand for insecticides and generic herbicides, and we expect some positives in seeds, as the Latin America season outlook improves. 
On Slide 7, Consumer Solutions continues to deliver impressive results, achieving record EBITDA of $341 million. Earnings increased in all businesses on market share gains, new business wins and robust demand for our innovative products.
Dow Automotive achieved record second quarter EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, driven by strong demand for light-weighting and sound dampening technologies and benefited from greater production of SUVs and trucks, which contained more Dow content. 
Consumer Care recorded higher earnings, led by double-digit volume growth in personal care applications, solid demand in home, car sectors and market share gains. 
Dow Electronic Materials delivered double-digit EBITDA growth on share gains in the semiconductor and display end markets. 
And our newly integrated Consumer Solutions silicones business captured greater market share on strong demand in the consumer care sector, notably in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
On Slide 8, Infrastructure Solutions also reported EBITDA growth in every business. Dow Building and Construction delivered a record quarterly EBITDA and saw a volume growth in most geographies on strong demand for its construction chemicals, spray foam insulation and continued adoption of our BLUEDGE technology. 
In Energy & Water Solutions, self-help actions mitigated persistent energy headwinds as oil and gas exploration project demand remains low. Water fundamentals, however, remained robust. Our new Saudi RO membrane plant is at full rates, positioning us well to meet demand in emerging geographies. 
We also saw improvement in Performance Monomers, reflecting our aggressive self-help measures, including our purposeful reduction in merchant sales exposure. 
Dow Coating Materials grew volume in all sectors, and our new vinyl acrylic binders are enabling share gains and diversification into value-add applications. 
Finally, our new Infrastructure Solutions Silicones business saw strong demand in the construction sector, enabling higher first half EBITDA. 
On Slide 9, Performance Materials & Chemicals had several moving parts in the quarter. Equity earnings were over $100 million lower, consistent with our modeling guidance, due to the change in ownership of MEGlobal, coupled with lower MEG energy prices and Sadara startup costs.  When you take into account these 2 items, the core Polyurethanes business performed well, as it continued to increasingly tilt toward its higher-value specialty portfolio. 
The business delivered double-digit volume growth in its systems houses on strong consumer demand, particularly in Asia Pacific, enabled by our new polyols plant in Thailand. This benefit, however, was offset by margin compression in the upstream portion of the business, where supply balances have loosened and turnaround and maintenance costs were higher due to a planned outage in Europe and a short unplanned outage in Brazil. 
In Industrial Solutions, putting the impacts on equity earnings to one side, our core business delivered flat earnings, as disciplined self-help actions offset challenging industrial end-market conditions. 
Turning to Performance Plastics on Slide 10, reported record second quarter EBITDA with volume gains across most businesses in all geographies. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved several second quarter records, including EBITDA and sales volume, enabled by operational excellence, reflecting an aligned team focused on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment. Additionally, the business recovered margin in Latin America on demand and growth. 
Dow Elastomers volume increases from strong demand for its innovative technologies in automotive. Hot-melt adhesives and athletic footwear were balanced by the impact of production from higher turnaround activity in the quarter. 
Dow Electronics -- Electrical and Telecommunications delivered volume growth across all geographies, led by double-digit gains in the Americas on continued demand for fiber optic, coax and jacketing solutions. 
Turning now to Slide 12. As Andrew stated, our teams successfully closed to the ownership restructuring of Dow Corning in June. As we worked together more closely with the Dow Corning team, we discovered even more opportunities to streamline, giving us the confidence to increase our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million, with 1,800 role reductions directly related to Dow Corning. We expect to achieve a 70% run rate within 12 months of closing and the full cost synergy run rate within 24 months. The growth synergies of $100 million will be captured within 36 months. This transaction will unlock significant value for Dow shareholders, and it is expected to be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year 1. And at full synergy run rate, it's expected to add greater than $1 billion of EBITDA to our bottom line. 
Finally, in order to leave ample time for Q&A at the end of the call, we have included our usual modeling guidance slide in the appendix of the deck. 
I'll now turn it over to Jim."

I'll start with an important growth lever, our Plastics franchise. 
The dynamics across the polyethylene chain can shift significantly over time and is critical to remain agile and adaptive with this industry. The long-term winters are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, diversification and differentiation and global reach. And our results have shown that Dow does this exceptionally well time and time again, maximizing our returns while reducing our long-term earnings volatility. As value in the chain shifts over time, our direct-to-customer intimacy, innovation and application development and technical support differentiate our earnings unlike all of our competitors. 
On Slide 15, I'll go through our polyethylene view. Consistent with the view that we've held since the beginning of the year, we see polyethylene balances remaining stable over the next few years. Demand growth continues globally, as consumers expect the higher food safety standards, better sustainability of plastic packaging relative to the alternatives, and improvements in packaging functionality and convenience that polyethylene provide. On the ethylene supply side, our view takes into account that the leading industry consultants forecast capacity additions that overstate what actually gets built. We saw this play out just a few years ago. 
And we think that incremental delays and project postponements will happen once again. In fact, we've already seen evidence of this. 
We believe that both ethylene and polyethylene rates will remain high globally, and we continue to expect higher operating rates in polyethylene than in ethylene. And as we've seen this year, there may be some regional differences.
Earlier this year, some called for a very weak conditions in the second half of the year. We did not hold that view. And today, margins remain firm globally, and inventories are below average. I will state once again that we see continuing good conditions with expected seasonality over the next few years. 
In this environment, the Sadara additions will position us well to capture growth where growth exists. That 26 units at this world-scale facility, the largest of its kind ever built in a single phase, continue to come online. We're in a ramp and startup activity right now. We have qualified 25 polyethylene products to-date and have shipped polyethylene from the first 2 trains to nearly 100 customers in more than 25 countries. The multi-feed cracker is now in the early phases of startup, and we expect commercial operation in the third quarter. All construction at the Sadara site should be completed by year-end, with commissioning thereafter. We are happy with the progress made to-date, and we'll continue to provide updates as we get closer to year-end. 
I'll leave my comments with DowDuPont on Slide 16. We continued to make significant progress on the transaction and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. All key deliverables remain on track, and just last week, both companies received overwhelming support from our respective shareholders to approve the merger. We continue to focus on preparations for day 1, developing the financials for the intended spends and also driving the regulatory approval process. As I've said before, the vast majority of Dow people are focused on day-to-day business results, and our teams are doing a great job of making sure these transactions do not take away from our sharp focus to deliver the 2016 financial plan. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew for our outlook and earnings drivers."

Our earnings growth drivers are very visible to us, clearly definable and will be appearing in our bottom line results over these next few years. Just to remind you, from 2012 to 2015, Dow has delivered an EPS growth CAGR of 22% per year based on an intervention mindset on productivity and portfolio management, aggressive self-help actions, if you like. During this time, our R&D and innovation agenda delivered new products and technologies and upgrading our margin from 13% to 20% in the same period and growing core volumes on average 2% per year. 
As you could see from this quarter's results, we are at a $10 billion EBITDA run rate. Building from 2015's results and adding our specific actions, interventions and projects, we grow the new Dow's EBITDA post-intended spin to greater than $15 billion of EBITDA and 25% EBITDA margin. You can see here what we count: productivity premerger; the U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara investments at steady run rate; the Dow Corning transaction; and the Dow DuPont transaction, which are the material synergies targets of $1.5 billion, plus Dow's Performance Materials business, minus Dow's Agricultural Sciences and Electronic Materials business. Note that we do not count any growth synergies, any market organic growth or any new innovation contribution. These new earning streams are in motion and are known to us and described to you. And we would do all of this in a market and global economy that is mixed at best. Our outlook is that this won't change. Volatility and macro uncertainties are the new norm. But Dow will deliver, as it has these many years, by firmly executing against our earnings growth drivers. And we will continue to grow earnings before, during and after the merger and its intended spins. We have the team to do so. We have not been, nor will we be, distracted in delivering value for our shareholders.

So I think you're seeing that reflected, the polyethylene price reflects that robust demand. And then my point on inventories, I mean, the derivative demand is much tighter than the ethylene demand, and we think that's going to remain the case. In fact, we continue to see announcements of projects slide out of the pipeline. I reflected that in my comments. We continue to see delays forecasted, later start-ups, projects being completely taken out of the forecasts for ethylene. So I think, to your point about back half of the year, I think you're going to see more of the same that you have seen. We see a little bit of seasonality toward the end of the year, typically.

Post 2020, there might be a few more startups, but I don't think many of you are modeling 2020. So let's work on understanding that the dynamic right now is quite favorable."

And I think we're going to continue to see Latin America come back. Obviously, the impact of the lower GDP has a little bit of a market sentimental impact on what happens with the consumer market. But when you look at the currency impacts in Latin America, and for that matter, in most of the developing world, most of the inflationary impacts, as those currency changes, have already been felt. And that's, I think, what leads into our comments that we think, in the emerging geographies, we're seeing a bottom and, hopefully, a recovery from this point on. Meanwhile, the United States, given the energy feedstock competitiveness, is still one of the lowest-cost places in the world to make these products. And so we still have the ability to export, based on our global reach, to all parts of the world. And based on the fact that we're focusing on the higher-value end markets, where most of the new capacity that's coming on is coming on in the really highly commoditized segment, it gives us the added benefit of the power of innovation. So when you look at that power of innovation and the competitiveness of scale that we have, I think we're well positioned to take advantage of this whole market situation. Relative to your point on our timing, our Sadara plants are up and the cracker is in the startup phase right now. In fact, the systems are running, and we're in the phase right before you really bring on the rest of the furnaces. We got things inventoried in the hydrocarbons units, and we're drying out the rest of the plant and getting ready to go. So you're going to see polyethylene running here. And our hope is that polyethylene turns favorable, more of a tailwind, for the plastics business in the back half of the year. U.S. Gulf Coast, the cracker project is making tremendous progress. I think we're well above the 70% the completion rate. And as we said, we're going to have that up by mid next year. And the polyethylene plants are coming along very nicely. I was just down in Plaquemine last month, and I have been down in Texas the last couple of months, and we're making tremendous progress on those. So I think our timing is very consistent with every previous report we've given you on those plants."

So when we get to the next administration and we engage, we'll engage on all the things that matter to the company, notably trade. Just a little reminder -- because I've been asked this question a few times, just a little reminder that the United States has actually put in very few trade agreements in the last 10 years, actually 3 specific bilats and one multi-lats in the works, but not yet done. So I would tell you, we haven't really been exposed to the positives of trade, and most of it is because the way Jim answered the other question, which is we're on the ground pretty much everywhere else. And so regionalization, the sum of all the places you're in, which is 37 countries for Dow, we're on the ground with physical facility in 37 countries means we have local market access under all sorts of trade environments. And there are great trade agreements going on between Asian countries and European Union and elsewhere, so we benefit from all of those. I would like to see the U.S. get to a multi-lat trade agreement, the TPP, but we're not counting on it. I think what we're going to see here is a lot of uncertainties in the political environment. And I grew up in Asia, where there were trade barriers everywhere. So Dow has the strategy to operate and generate profit in economies that grow wherever there is growth. And we have the diversification of geographic mix to take a few countries being on the Dow side of growth, i.e. like Brazil right now, and of course, manage the upside, and like the U.S. and China right now. So I am not particularly concerned about the rhetoric that's going on right now."

We've always had the leading supply in glass bonding. So that business continues to perform exceptionally well. And the addition of crash-durable adhesives, I can't underestimate how much of a growth driver that is for this business. Not just in -- I mean, we've highlighted our experience with Ford in the F150, where we're bonding aluminum to a steel structure, and not just light-weighting the vehicle but improving the crash-safety rating of that vehicle, a class of vehicles. It's not known for high crash safety ratings. But that applies in other dissimilar materials. Or whether you're talking about carbon fiber composites on a steel frame, that application still applies. And as we continue to see others focus on light-weighting, and our driving force in automotive has been and continues to be a seat at the design table with the brand owners so that we can actually get out there and get our products spect [ph] in, we're continuing to see strong growth drivers in those businesses.

I think it's a very good question, Hassan, and it's the reason we put that in the back of the deck. I'm glad you looked at that. I think a couple of things. Obviously, on the demand side for ethane, my comments about what's happening with project delays and things are sliding out the timing impacts a little bit of that demand picture. But the power of feedstock flexibility here is what we always talk about in Dow, and one of the reasons we invest the way that we do is that propane and natural gas play a big role in this too. So propane right now is capping ethane, and the other dynamic that you see happening is that propane exports out of the U.S. are really flooding and exhausting some of the available buyers that are in that market. And natural gas prices are low. And the supply, even with the rig counts down, the supply has continued to be very strong, and now we're starting to see rig counts pick up a little bit. So our view here is that despite the exports, despite all the other things happening, you're still going to be long, propane and ethane, and you're going to be longer nat gas and propane than you are ethane. And when you're long propane and propanes in the crack slates, that's advantaged out. And so that's what we play for. Obviously, we have the flexibility to go back into ethane when that's possible. But look, there's more gas supply at low cost that's coming on every day not just in the U.S., it's coming on in the Middle East. It's in Australia. It's putting pressure on these gas prices, and that's going to help us out."

And there's been corrections out there because the view is -- the basis of your question, Hassan, is that, in some way, where naphtha is versus ethane, where naphtha is versus propane, is linked where oil is versus gas. And what we have seen and what we've said and what we've now performed against under these diverse environment is: firstly, our geographic mix helps us; secondly, our feedstock flexibility enables us; thirdly, we've added to that flexibility, i.e. propane in Europe for a great example of that, and we see propane as long as far as the eye can see; and lastly and very importantly, low oil price over time has enabled consumer demand. It took a while, but it's here. U.S. consumers are spending because they've got more money in their pockets. That's also happening in countries like China, which is becoming more consumer-led. So a low oil price with the enablement of feedstock flexibility on the Dow side, with ethane, propane, some butane, certainly in the U.S., and our feedstock flexibility engine in the Europe means we can maximize profits in the chain that keeps slide that Jim had in his deck. So we can make money as long as there is demand. The feedstock input/output thing, we are managing to maximize profit, maximize margin, which is a price-volume trade-off in that chain.

Self-help actions for the last many years on reducing costs, taking productivity to the bottom line, keeping it sticky, the 2,500 positions we are reducing, i.e. the 700 extra on top of the Dow Corning announcement, is a great example of how we're continuing to work the cost engine, not just feedstocks but actual costs, so that we can stay in a margin-expansion mode now 15 in a row. This is not only yielded margin but the working capital side of things. You got to look at what we've done. We produced 1 billion more pounds in the quarter from a year ago, 2 billion pounds more from the same machine from the first half point of view. Those extra pounds, and that's high operating rate, and disciplined working capital is generating this extra free cash flow that will feed the share buyback question that Howard answer. And we're very committed the working capital management, cash flow management, free cash flow generation to keep working the balance sheet so we can increase share buybacks.

If you turn to Slide 3 -- and good morning, everyone. 
Let me open the review of the quarter by stepping back and just looking at our three simple and very focused goals of the year: first one, achieve our plans; second one, close Dow Corning by mid-year; and third, drive the merger milestones with DuPont for a year-end close -- simple, clear, and focused. 
Let's start with the plan. Dow's relentless and disciplined execution once again delivered another quarter of operating earnings growth and margin expansion. And the Dow team has again done it through a variety of challenging geopolitical and market conditions and outpacing our peers in the process. You can see that in our results: 15 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion, 11 consecutive quarters of volume growth. Notably, we delivered gains in all geographies, with particular strength in the United States, China and Europe. Cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion, up nearly 60% versus the year-ago period. 
We are focused on every aspect of the P&L and balance sheet to deliver these numbers with weekly operations meetings and very strong self-help actions. Our unique combination of world-class innovation, diversified integration and a narrow and deeper market focus enabled operating earnings growth in every business in our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions segments, while the strength of our Plastics franchise was again on display. 
We have built Dow's portfolio to grow both the top and bottom line, even though market and economic conditions remained challenging. In those markets that are challenged, we have been implementing proactive and targeted self-help measures. You can see this in our Ag segment, where our actions have generated earnings year-to-date that have outperformed the industry downturn. Another example is our recent restructuring announcement related to the Dow Corning transaction, which will reduce headcount by an additional 700 positions on top of the Dow Corning synergies to a total of 2,500 and accelerated earnings growth under these volatile market conditions. Howard will review our results in more granularity in a moment, but the income and cash flow results are truly noteworthy. 
Our second goal is, indeed, to close Dow Corning and its ownership restructuring, where we bring in a new element for growth in powerful technology platform that will further drives Dow's focus in an attractive targeted market segments as well as enhance the earnings power of the new Dow. Soon after closing, we also increased our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million. When combined with the estimated $100 million of growth synergies, we see a total of $500 million of synergies from this transaction. We achieved this goal ahead of schedule on June 1, and I'm happy to report that the integration has proceeded seamlessly. 
And on our third goal, we recently received overwhelming approval with a historic DowDuPont transaction from our shareholders, illustrating the market's recognition of this unique opportunity to deliver value to all stakeholders, as we drive the intended separation into 3 independent, leading science-based companies that will redefine their respective industries. Simply put, the Dow team is sharply focused on driving our 3 goals, and this quarter's report shows the results of this effort. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard to cover highlights from the quarter and an update on Dow Corning. Jim will then give an update on our Plastics franchise and DowDuPont. And I'll close with our outlook and earnings growth drivers. Howard?"

On Slide 5, Dow's financial performance had several noteworthy highlights in the second quarter. The team delivered operating EPS of $0.95 a share, despite the slow growth in uncertain macroeconomic environment. The Dow team found pockets of growth in all of our major geographies, and we kept our focus on driving further productivity gains, adding another $90 million of savings in the quarter, bringing our first half savings to $180 million, tracking well above our 2016 target of $300 million. 
Our innovative products and solutions are also winning in the marketplace. Many of our businesses highlighted market share gains and new business wins, as evidenced by our continued volume and margin growth in the quarter. 
Our overall operating EBITDA margin rose more than 160 basis points to 21%; our highest second quarter margin in a decade; led by gains in Consumer and Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics. 
We also achieved multiple records in the quarter, including EBITDA records in Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics and a sales volume record in Performance Plastics, all of which helped the team deliver an $800 million increase in cash flow from operations in the quarter.
Taking a longer view, the progress we've made over the past 4 years has enabled us to significantly grow EPS above our target of 10% annual growth, to continue to increase free cash flow generation, while fueling our future growth through targeted investments, and at the same time returned $14 billion through our shareholders through share buybacks and pay dividends. 
Now turning to our segment results on Slide 6, let's start with Ag. We're delivering despite high industry Crop Protection inventories, currency headwinds and low crop commodity prices, our Ag team continues to respond with targeted self-help actions that have largely offset the headwinds, while maintaining the long-term growth potential of our franchise. In the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth in corn seeds, but that was more than offset by soft demand in sunflower and soybeans. Crop Protection volume was lower, primarily due to reduced generic herbicide demand and the impact of the AgroFresh divestiture. 
For the year, we see the market declining 5% on robust yields in North America, high inventories and low crop prices. In the second half of 2016, Crop Protection volume is expected to be flat, with modest pricing pressure due to lower demand for insecticides and generic herbicides, and we expect some positives in seeds, as the Latin America season outlook improves. 
On Slide 7, Consumer Solutions continues to deliver impressive results, achieving record EBITDA of $341 million. Earnings increased in all businesses on market share gains, new business wins and robust demand for our innovative products.
Dow Automotive achieved record second quarter EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, driven by strong demand for light-weighting and sound dampening technologies and benefited from greater production of SUVs and trucks, which contained more Dow content. 
Consumer Care recorded higher earnings, led by double-digit volume growth in personal care applications, solid demand in home care sectors and market share gains. 
Dow Electronic Materials delivered double-digit EBITDA growth on share gains in the semiconductor and display end markets. 
And our newly integrated Consumer Solutions silicones business captured greater market share on strong demand in the consumer care sector, notably in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
On Slide 8, Infrastructure Solutions also reported EBITDA growth in every business. Dow Building and Construction delivered a record quarterly EBITDA and saw a volume growth in most geographies on strong demand for its construction chemicals, spray foam insulation and continued adoption of our BLUEDGE technology. 
In Energy & Water Solutions, self-help actions mitigated persistent energy headwinds as oil and gas exploration project demand remains low. Water fundamentals, however, remained robust. Our new Saudi RO membrane plant is at full rates, positioning us well to meet demand in emerging geographies. 
We also saw improvement in Performance Monomers, reflecting our aggressive self-help measures, including our purposeful reduction in merchant sales exposure. 
Dow Coating Materials grew volume in all sectors, and our new vinyl acrylic binders are enabling share gains and diversification into value-add applications. 
Finally, our new Infrastructure Solutions Silicones business saw strong demand in the construction sector, enabling higher first half EBITDA. 
On Slide 9, Performance Materials & Chemicals had several moving parts in the quarter. Equity earnings were over $100 million lower, consistent with our modeling guidance, due to the change in ownership of MEGlobal, coupled with lower MEG energy prices and Sadara startup costs.  When you take into account these 2 items, the core Polyurethanes business performed well, as it continued to increasingly tilt toward its higher-value specialty portfolio. 
The business delivered double-digit volume growth in its systems houses on strong consumer demand, particularly in Asia Pacific, enabled by our new polyols plant in Thailand. This benefit, however, was offset by margin compression in the upstream portion of the business, where supply balances have loosened and turnaround and maintenance costs were higher due to a planned outage in Europe and a short unplanned outage in Brazil. 
In Industrial Solutions, putting the impacts on equity earnings to one side, our core business delivered flat earnings, as disciplined self-help actions offset challenging industrial end-market conditions. 
Turning to Performance Plastics on Slide 10, reported record second quarter EBITDA with volume gains across most businesses in all geographies. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved several second quarter records, including EBITDA and sales volume, enabled by operational excellence, reflecting an aligned team focused on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment. Additionally, the business recovered margin in Latin America on demand and growth. 
Dow Elastomers volume increases from strong demand for its innovative technologies in automotive. Hot-melt adhesives and athletic footwear were balanced by the impact to production from higher turnaround activity in the quarter. 
Dow Electronics -- Electrical and Telecommunications delivered volume growth across all geographies, led by double-digit gains in the Americas on continued demand for fiber optic, coax and jacketing solutions. 
Turning now to Slide 12. As Andrew stated, our teams successfully closed the ownership restructuring of Dow Corning in June. As we worked together more closely with the Dow Corning team, we discovered even more opportunities to streamline, giving us the confidence to increase our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million, with 1,800 role reductions directly related to Dow Corning. We expect to achieve a 70% run rate within 12 months of closing and the full cost synergy run rate within 24 months. The growth synergies of $100 million will be captured within 36 months. This transaction will unlock significant value for Dow shareholders, and it is expected to be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year one. And at full synergy run rate, it's expected to add greater than $1 billion of EBITDA to our bottom line. 
Finally, in order to leave ample time for Q&A at the end of the call, we have included our usual modeling guidance slide in the appendix of the deck. 
I'll now turn it over to Jim."

I'll start with an important growth lever, our Plastics franchise. 
The dynamics across the polyethylene chain can shift significantly over time and it is critical to remain agile and adaptive with this industry. The long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, diversification and differentiation and global reach. And our results have shown that Dow does this exceptionally well time and time again, maximizing our returns while reducing our long-term earnings volatility. As value in the chain shifts over time, our direct-to-customer intimacy, innovation and application development and technical support differentiate our earnings unlike all of our competitors. 
On Slide 15, I'll go through our polyethylene view. Consistent with the view that we've held since the beginning of the year, we see polyethylene balances remaining stable over the next few years. Demand growth continues globally, as consumers expect the higher food safety standards, better sustainability of plastic packaging relative to the alternatives, and improvements in packaging functionality and convenience that polyethylene provide. On the ethylene supply side, our view takes into account that the leading industry consultants forecast capacity additions that overstate what actually gets built. We saw this play out just a few years ago.  And we think that incremental delays and project postponements will happen once again. In fact, we've already seen evidence of this. 
We believe that both ethylene and polyethylene rates will remain high globally, and we continue to expect higher operating rates in polyethylene than in ethylene. And as we've seen this year, there may be some regional differences.
Earlier this year, some called for very weak conditions in the second half of the year. We did not hold that view. And today, margins remain firm globally, and inventories are below average. I will state once again that we see continuing good conditions with expected seasonality over the next few years. 
In this environment, the Sadara additions will position us well to capture growth where growth exists. The 26 units at this world-scale facility, the largest of its kind ever built in a single phase, continue to come online. We're in a ramp and startup activity right now. We have qualified 25 polyethylene products to-date and have shipped polyethylene from the first 2 trains to nearly 100 customers in more than 25 countries. The multi-feed cracker is now in the early phases of startup, and we expect commercial operation in the third quarter. All construction at the Sadara site should be complete by year-end, with commissioning thereafter. We are happy with the progress made to-date, and we'll continue to provide updates as we get closer to year-end. 
I'll leave my comments with DowDuPont on Slide 16. We continue to make significant progress on the transaction and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. All key deliverables remain on track, and just last week, both companies received overwhelming support from our respective shareholders to approve the merger. We continue to focus on preparations for day one, developing the financials for the intended spins and also driving the regulatory approval process. As I've said before, the vast majority of Dow people are focused on day-to-day business results, and our teams are doing a great job of making sure these transactions do not take away from our sharp focus to deliver the 2016 financial plan. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew for our outlook and earnings drivers."

Our earnings growth drivers are very visible to us, clearly definable and will be appearing in our bottom line results over these next few years. Just to remind you, from 2012 to 2015, Dow has delivered an EPS growth CAGR of 22% per year based on an intervention mindset on productivity and portfolio management, aggressive self-help actions, if you like. During this time, our R&D and innovation agenda delivered new products and technologies and upgrading our margin from 13% to 20% in the same period and growing core volumes on average 2% per year. 
As you could see from this quarter's results, we are at a $10 billion EBITDA run rate. Building from 2015's results and adding our specific actions, interventions and projects, we grow the new Dow's EBITDA post-intended spin to greater than $15 billion of EBITDA and 25% EBITDA margin. You can see here what we count: productivity premerger; the U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara investments at steady run rate; the Dow Corning transaction; and the Dow DuPont transaction, which are material synergies targets of $1.5 billion, plus Dow's Performance Materials business, minus Dow's Agricultural Sciences and Electronic Materials business. Note that we do not count any growth synergies, any market organic growth or any new innovation contribution. These new earning streams are in motion and are known to us and described to you. And we will do all of this in a market and global economy that is mixed at best. Our outlook is that this won't change. Volatility and macro uncertainties are the new norm. But Dow will deliver, as it has these last many years, by firmly executing against our earnings growth drivers. And we will continue to grow earnings before, during and after the merger and its intended spins. We have the team to do so. We have not been, nor will we be, distracted in delivering value for our shareholders. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

In fact, we had growth in all geographic areas, especially EMEA and Asia Pacific and also, this year, in Latin America. So hopeful that we're seeing a rebound in the developing economies right now. And our operating EBITDA is up 7% versus same quarter last year. Compared to previous quarter, pricing is up. Compared to same quarter last year, pricing's off about $0.01. So I think you're seeing that reflected; the polyethylene price reflects that robust demand. And then my point on inventories, I mean, the derivative demand is much tighter than the ethylene demand, and we think that's going to remain the case. In fact, we continue to see announcements of projects slide out of the pipeline. I reflected that in my comments. We continue to see delays forecasted, later start-ups, projects being completely taken out of the forecasts for ethylene. So I think, to your point about back half of the year, I think you're going to see more of the same that you have seen. We see a little bit of seasonality toward the end of the year, typically.

And I think we're going to continue to see Latin America come back. Obviously, the impact of the lower GDP has a little bit of a market sentimental impact on what happens with the consumer market. But when you look at the currency impacts in Latin America, and for that matter, in most of the developing world, most of the inflationary impacts, as those currency changes, have already been felt. And that's, I think, what leads into our comments that we think, in the emerging geographies, we're seeing a bottom and, hopefully, a recovery from this point on. Meanwhile, the United States -- given the energy feedstock competitiveness -- is still one of the lowest-cost places in the world to make these products. And so we still have the ability to export, based on our global reach, to all parts of the world. And based on the fact that we're focusing on the higher-value end markets, where most of the new capacity that's coming on is coming on in the really highly commoditized segments, it gives us the added benefit of the power of innovation. So when you look at that power of innovation and the competitiveness of scale that we have, I think we're well positioned to take advantage of this whole market situation. Relative to your point on our timing, our Sadara plants are up and the cracker is in the startup phase right now. In fact, the systems are running, and we're in the phase right before you really bring on the rest of the furnaces. We've got things inventoried in the hydrocarbons units, and we're drying out the rest of the plant and getting ready to go. So you're going to see polyethylene running here. And our hope is that polyethylene turns favorable, more of a tailwind, for the plastics business in the back half of the year. U.S. Gulf Coast, the cracker project is making tremendous progress. I think we're well above the 70% completion rate. And as we said, we're going to have that up by mid next year. And the polyethylene plants are coming along very nicely. I was just down in Plaquemine last month, and I have been down in Texas the last couple of months, and we're making tremendous progress on those. So I think our timing is very consistent with every previous report we've given you on those plants."

So when we get to the next administration and we engage, we'll engage on all the things that matter to the company, notably trade. Just a little reminder -- because I've been asked this question a few times, just a little reminder that the United States has actually put in very few trade agreements in the last 10 years, actually 3 specific bilats and one multi-lat in the works, but not yet done. So I would tell you, we haven't really been exposed to the positives of trade, and most of it is put the way Jim answered the other question, which is we're on the ground pretty much everywhere else. And so regionalization, the sum of all the places you're in, which is 37 countries for Dow, we're on the ground with physical facility in 37 countries means we have local market access under all sorts of trade environments. And there are great trade agreements going on between Asian countries and European Union and elsewhere, so we benefit from all of those. I would like to see the U.S. get to a multi-lat trade agreement -- the TPP, but we're not counting on it. I think what we're going to see here is a lot of uncertainties in the political environment. And I grew up in Asia, where there were trade barriers everywhere. So Dow has the strategy to operate and generate profit in economies that grow wherever there is growth. And we have the diversification of geographic mix to take a few countries being on the downside of growth, i.e. like Brazil right now, and of course, manage the upside, and like the U.S. and China right now.

And look, we still believe that automotive, this year, is going to have a production level that's above last year, even if it's just slightly above. And sales continue to be strong there. We've always had the leading supply in glass bonding. So that business continues to perform exceptionally well. And the addition of crash-durable adhesives, I can't underestimate how much of a growth driver that is for this business. Not just in -- I mean, we've highlighted our experience with Ford in the F150, where we're bonding aluminum to a steel structure, and not just light-weighting the vehicle but improving the crash-safety rating of that vehicle; a class of vehicle that's not known for high crash safety ratings. But that applies in other dissimilar materials. So whether you're talking about carbon fiber composites on a steel frame, that application still applies. And as we continue to see others focus on light-weighting -- and our driving force in automotive has been and continues to be a seat at the design table with the brand owners so that we can actually get out there and get our products spec-ed in -- we're continuing to see strong growth drivers in those businesses. And that is before we even think about what we can do with the power of Dow Corning silicones in the mix."

So Howard and I made a trip out there just this last weekend, and we had a thorough review with the project team. Jim's on the board, and he is the lead for Dow on that board. The new energy minister,  Khalid al-Falih, the previous CEO of Aramco, was present for a whole day. We are into the granular detail of starting up 25 units all in parallel, and many of them -- it is over 500 Dow people on the site to assist the local Saudis and getting it all up and running. Very impressed with the quality of that Saudi workforce, by the way. It's first class. We've trained them around the world. They're great. And we've got the human resources on the ground and, of course, went out working on the most important one of them all, which is getting the mixed-feed cracker up and running. And then Jim may comment on that. Actually, they fed ethane in while we were there for the first time. And not often that you want to see a ground flare burning ethylene, but everyone was celebrating the burning of ethylene though the ground flare. That's just a little piece of detail for you to let you know that's real things happen on that site. Now the handoffs, the multistage handoffs. The fact that we are allowing most of this year and all of next year to get these handoffs before we are all the way done, there's going to be a lot of those handoffs on either phases. So Jim, you may want to comment on the complexity and what we expect."

There seems to be this perception that ethane is going to get tight very quickly, and I've heard numbers like $0.50 to $0.60 a gallon, imminently, being thrown around. Now you clearly have a slide in the deck talking about your views on ethane being long, so: a, would love for you to talk a bit about why you feel ethane is going to be long; and b, what sort of energy pricing stack are you using when you're coming up with your ethane supply/demand sort of analysis?"

I think it's a very good question, Hassan, and it's the reason we put that in the back of the deck. I'm glad you looked at that. I think a couple of things. Obviously, on the demand side for ethane, my comments about what's happening with project delays and things are sliding out the timing, impacts a little bit of that demand picture. But the power of feedstock flexibility here is what we always talk about in Dow, and one of the reasons we invest the way that we do is that propane and natural gas play a big role in this too. So propane right now is capping ethane, and the other dynamic that you see happening is that propane exports out of the U.S. are really flooding and exhausting some of the available buyers that are in that market. And natural gas prices are low. And the supply, even with the rig counts down, the supply has continued to be very strong, and now we're starting to see rig counts pick up a little bit. So our view here is that despite the exports, despite all the other things happening, you're still going to be long, propane and ethane, and you're going to be longer nat gas and propane than you are ethane. And when you're long propane and propanes in the crack slates, that's advantaged out. And so that's what we play for. Obviously, we have the flexibility to go back into ethane when that's possible. But look, there's more gas supply at low cost that's coming on every day not just in the U.S., it's coming on in the Middle East. It's in Australia. It's putting pressure on these gas prices, and that's going to help us out."

And there's been corrections out there because the view is -- the basis of your question, Hassan, is that, in some way, where naphtha is versus ethane, where naphtha is versus propane, is linked to where oil is versus gas. And what we have seen and what we've said and what we've now performed against under these diverse environments is: firstly, our geographic mix helps us; secondly, our feedstock flexibility enables us; thirdly, we've added to that flexibility, i.e. propane in Europe for a great example of that, and we see propane as long as far as the eye can see; and lastly and very importantly, low oil price over time has enabled consumer demand. It took a while, but it's here. U.S. consumers are spending because they've got more money in their pockets. That's also happening in countries like China, which is becoming more consumer-led. So a low oil price with the enablement of feedstock flexibility on the Dow side, with ethane, propane, some butane, certainly in the U.S., and our feedstock flexibility engine in the Europe means we can maximize profits in the chain; that key slide that Jim had in his deck. So we can make money as long as there is demand. The feedstock input/output thing, we are managing to maximize profit, maximize margin, which is a price-volume trade-off in that chain.

We have the portfolio to keep performing and keep strong performance, but we're not resting there. Self-help actions for the last many years on reducing costs, taking productivity to the bottom line, keeping it sticky. The 2,500 positions we are reducing, i.e. the 700 extra on top of the Dow Corning announcement, is a great example of how we're continuing to work the cost engine, not just feedstocks but actual costs, so that we can stay in a margin-expansion mode now 15 in a row. This is not only yielded margin but the working capital side of this. You got to look at what we've done. We produced 1 billion more pounds in the quarter from a year ago, 2 billion pounds more from the same machine from the first half point of view. Those extra pounds, and that's high operating rate, and disciplined working capital is generating this extra free cash flow that will feed the share buyback question that Howard answered. And we're very committed the working capital management, cash flow management, free cash flow generation to keep working the balance sheet so we can increase share buybacks. 
And then this strong demand environment will continue. Look, it's not a great global economy, but it's a consumer-led economy, and our products speak to it. And our new plants will come online at the right time. So all of our interventions and actions are producing and they continue to produce.

If you turn to Slide 3 -- and good morning, everyone. Let me open the review of the quarter by stepping back and just looking at our 3 simple and very focused goals of the year: first one, achieve our plans; second one, close Dow Cornin",578,"Thank you, Neal. If you turn to Slide 3 -- and good morning, everyone. 
Let me open the review of the quarter by stepping back and just looking at our 3 simple and very focused goals of the year: first one, achieve our plans; second one, close Dow Corning by mid-year; and third, drive the merger milestones with DuPont for a year-end close -- simple, clear, and focused. 
Let's start with the plan. Dow's relentless and disciplined execution once again delivered another quarter of operating earnings growth and margin expansion. And the Dow team has again done it through a variety of challenging geopolitical and market conditions and outpacing our peers in the process. You can see that in our results: 15 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion, 11 consecutive quarters of volume growth. Notably, we delivered gains in all geographies, with particular strength in the United States, China and Europe. Cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion, up nearly 60% versus the year-ago period. 
We are focused on every aspect of the P&L and balance sheet to deliver these numbers with weekly operations meetings and very strong self-help actions. Our unique combination of world-class innovation, diversified integration and a narrow and deeper market focus enabled operating earnings growth in every business in our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions segments, while the strength of our Plastics franchise was again on display. 
We have built Dow's portfolio to grow both the top and bottom line, even though market and economic conditions remained challenging. In those markets that are challenged, we have been implementing proactive and targeted self-help measures. You can see this in our Ag segment, where our actions have generated earnings year-to-date that have outperformed the industry downturn. Another example is our recent restructuring announcement related to the Dow Corning transaction, which will reduce headcount by an additional 700 positions on top of the Dow Corning synergies to a total of 2,500 and accelerated earnings growth under these volatile market conditions. Howard will review our results in more granularity in a moment, but the income and cash flow results are truly noteworthy. 
Our second goal is, indeed, to close Dow Corning and its ownership restructuring, where we bring in a new element for growth in powerful technology platform that will further drives Dow's focus in an attractive targeted market segments as well as enhance the earnings power of the new Dow. Soon after closing, we also increased our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million. When combined with the estimated $100 million of growth synergies, we see a total of $500 million of synergies from this transaction. We achieved this goal ahead of schedule on June 1, and I'm happy to report that the integration has proceeded seamlessly. 
And on our third goal, we recently received overwhelming approval with a historic DowDuPont transaction from our shareholders, illustrating the market's recognition of this unique opportunity to deliver value to all stakeholders, as we drive the intended separation into 3 independent, leading science-based companies that will redefine their respective industries. Simply put, the Dow team is sharply focused on driving our 3 goals, and this quarter's report shows the results of this effort. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard to cover highlights from the quarter and an update on Dow Corning. Jim will then give an update on our Plastics franchise and DowDuPont. And I'll close with our outlook and earnings growth drivers. Howard?"

On Slide 5, Dow's financial performance had several noteworthy highlights in the second quarter. The team delivered operating EPS of $0.95 a share, despite the slow growth in uncertain macroeconomic environment. The Dow team found pockets of growth in all of our major geographies, and we kept our focus on driving further productivity gains, adding another $90 million of savings in the quarter, bringing our first half savings to $180 million, tracking well above our 2016 target of $300 million. 
Our innovative products and solutions are also winning in the marketplace. Many of our businesses highlighted market share gains and new business wins, as evidenced by our continued volume and margin growth in the quarter. 
Our overall operating EBITDA margin rose more than 160 basis points to 21%; our highest second quarter margin in a decade; led by gains in Consumer and Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics. 
We also achieved multiple records in the quarter, including EBITDA records in Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics and a sales volume record in Performance Plastics, all of which helped the team deliver an $800 million increase in cash flow from operations in the quarter.
Taking a longer view, the progress we've made over the past 4 years has enabled us to significantly grow EPS above our target of 10% annual growth, to continue to increase free cash flow generation, while fueling our future growth through targeted investments, and at the same time returned $14 billion through our shareholders through share buybacks and pay dividends. 
Now turning to our segment results on Slide 6, let's start with Ag. We're delivering despite high industry Crop Protection inventories, currency headwinds and low crop commodity prices, our Ag team continues to respond with targeted self-help actions that have largely offset the headwinds, while maintaining the long-term growth potential of our franchise. In the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth in corn seeds, but that was more than offset by soft demand in sunflower and soybeans. Crop Protection volume was lower, primarily due to reduced generic herbicide demand and the impact of the AgroFresh divestiture. 
For the year, we see the market declining 5% on robust yields in North America, high inventories and low crop prices. In the second half of 2016, Crop Protection volume is expected to be flat, with modest pricing pressure due to lower demand for insecticides and generic herbicides, and we expect some positives in seeds, as the Latin America season outlook improves. 
On Slide 7, Consumer Solutions continues to deliver impressive results, achieving record EBITDA of $341 million. Earnings increased in all businesses on market share gains, new business wins and robust demand for our innovative products.
Dow Automotive achieved record second quarter EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, driven by strong demand for light-weighting and sound dampening technologies and benefited from greater production of SUVs and trucks, which contained more Dow content. 
Consumer Care recorded higher earnings, led by double-digit volume growth in personal care applications, solid demand in home care sectors and market share gains. 
Dow Electronic Materials delivered double-digit EBITDA growth on share gains in the semiconductor and display end markets. 
And our newly integrated Consumer Solutions silicones business captured greater market share on strong demand in the consumer care sector, notably in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
On Slide 8, Infrastructure Solutions also reported EBITDA growth in every business. Dow Building and Construction delivered a record quarterly EBITDA and saw a volume growth in most geographies on strong demand for its construction chemicals, spray foam insulation and continued adoption of our BLUEDGE technology. 
In Energy & Water Solutions, self-help actions mitigated persistent energy headwinds as oil and gas exploration project demand remains low. Water fundamentals, however, remained robust. Our new Saudi RO membrane plant is at full rates, positioning us well to meet demand in emerging geographies. 
We also saw improvement in Performance Monomers, reflecting our aggressive self-help measures, including our purposeful reduction in merchant sales exposure. 
Dow Coating Materials grew volume in all sectors, and our new vinyl acrylic binders are enabling share gains and diversification into value-add applications. 
Finally, our new Infrastructure Solutions Silicones business saw strong demand in the construction sector, enabling higher first half EBITDA. 
On Slide 9, Performance Materials & Chemicals had several moving parts in the quarter. Equity earnings were over $100 million lower, consistent with our modeling guidance, due to the change in ownership of MEGlobal, coupled with lower MEG energy prices and Sadara startup costs. When you take into account these 2 items, the core Polyurethanes business performed well, as it continued to increasingly tilt toward its higher-value specialty portfolio. 
The business delivered double-digit volume growth in its systems houses on strong consumer demand, particularly in Asia Pacific, enabled by our new polyols plant in Thailand. This benefit, however, was offset by margin compression in the upstream portion of the business, where supply balances have loosened and turnaround and maintenance costs were higher due to a planned outage in Europe and a short unplanned outage in Brazil. 
In Industrial Solutions, putting the impacts on equity earnings to one side, our core business delivered flat earnings, as disciplined self-help actions offset challenging industrial end-market conditions. 
Turning to Performance Plastics on Slide 10, reported record second quarter EBITDA with volume gains across most businesses in all geographies. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved several second quarter records, including EBITDA and sales volume, enabled by operational excellence, reflecting an aligned team focused on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment. Additionally, the business recovered margin in Latin America on demand and growth. 
Dow Elastomers volume increases from strong demand for its innovative technologies in automotive. Hot-melt adhesives and athletic footwear were balanced by the impact to production from higher turnaround activity in the quarter. 
Dow Electronics -- Electrical and Telecommunications delivered volume growth across all geographies, led by double-digit gains in the Americas on continued demand for fiber optic, coax and jacketing solutions. 
Turning now to Slide 12. As Andrew stated, our teams successfully closed the ownership restructuring of Dow Corning in June. As we worked together more closely with the Dow Corning team, we discovered even more opportunities to streamline, giving us the confidence to increase our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million, with 1,800 role reductions directly related to Dow Corning. We expect to achieve a 70% run rate within 12 months of closing and the full cost synergy run rate within 24 months. The growth synergies of $100 million will be captured within 36 months. This transaction will unlock significant value for Dow shareholders, and it is expected to be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year 1. And at full synergy run rate, it's expected to add greater than $1 billion of EBITDA to our bottom line. 
Finally, in order to leave ample time for Q&A at the end of the call, we have included our usual modeling guidance slide in the appendix of the deck. 
I'll now turn it over to Jim."

I'll start with an important growth lever, our Plastics franchise. 
The dynamics across the polyethylene chain can shift significantly over time and it is critical to remain agile and adaptive with this industry. The long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, diversification and differentiation and global reach. And our results have shown that Dow does this exceptionally well time and time again, maximizing our returns while reducing our long-term earnings volatility. As value in the chain shifts over time, our direct-to-customer intimacy, innovation and application development and technical support differentiate our earnings unlike all of our competitors. 
On Slide 15, I'll go through our polyethylene view. Consistent with the view that we've held since the beginning of the year, we see polyethylene balances remaining stable over the next few years. Demand growth continues globally, as consumers expect the higher food safety standards, better sustainability of plastic packaging relative to the alternatives, and improvements in packaging functionality and convenience that polyethylene provide. On the ethylene supply side, our view takes into account that the leading industry consultants forecast capacity additions that overstate what actually gets built. We saw this play out just a few years ago. And we think that incremental delays and project postponements will happen once again. In fact, we've already seen evidence of this. 
We believe that both ethylene and polyethylene rates will remain high globally, and we continue to expect higher operating rates in polyethylene than in ethylene. And as we've seen this year, there may be some regional differences.
Earlier this year, some called for very weak conditions in the second half of the year. We did not hold that view. And today, margins remain firm globally, and inventories are below average. I will state once again that we see continuing good conditions with expected seasonality over the next few years. 
In this environment, the Sadara additions will position us well to capture growth where growth exists. The 26 units at this world-scale facility, the largest of its kind ever built in a single phase, continue to come online. We're in a ramp and startup activity right now. We have qualified 25 polyethylene products to-date and have shipped polyethylene from the first 2 trains to nearly 100 customers in more than 25 countries. The multi-feed cracker is now in the early phases of startup, and we expect commercial operation in the third quarter. All construction at the Sadara site should be complete by year-end, with commissioning thereafter. We are happy with the progress made to-date, and we'll continue to provide updates as we get closer to year-end. 
I'll leave my comments with DowDuPont on Slide 16. We continue to make significant progress on the transaction and the pursuit of the intended separation into 3 independent publicly traded companies. All key deliverables remain on track, and just last week, both companies received overwhelming support from our respective shareholders to approve the merger. We continue to focus on preparations for day 1, developing the financials for the intended spins and also driving the regulatory approval process. As I've said before, the vast majority of Dow people are focused on day-to-day business results, and our teams are doing a great job of making sure these transactions do not take away from our sharp focus to deliver the 2016 financial plan. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew for our outlook and earnings drivers."

Our earnings growth drivers are very visible to us, clearly definable and will be appearing in our bottom line results over these next few years. Just to remind you, from 2012 to 2015, Dow has delivered an EPS growth CAGR of 22% per year based on an intervention mindset on productivity and portfolio management, aggressive self-help actions, if you like. During this time, our R&D and innovation agenda delivered new products and technologies and upgrading our margin from 13% to 20% in the same period and growing core volumes on average 2% per year. 
As you could see from this quarter's results, we are at a $10 billion EBITDA run rate. Building from 2015's results and adding our specific actions, interventions and projects, we grow the new Dow's EBITDA post-intended spin to greater than $15 billion of EBITDA and 25% EBITDA margin. You can see here what we count: productivity premerger; the U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara investments at steady run rate; the Dow Corning transaction; and the Dow DuPont transaction, which are material synergies targets of $1.5 billion, plus Dow's Performance Materials business, minus Dow's Agricultural Sciences and Electronic Materials business. Note that we do not count any growth synergies, any market organic growth or any new innovation contribution. These new earning streams are in motion and are known to us and described to you. And we will do all of this in a market and global economy that is mixed at best. Our outlook is that this won't change. Volatility and macro uncertainties are the new norm. But Dow will deliver, as it has these last many years, by firmly executing against our earnings growth drivers. And we will continue to grow earnings before, during and after the merger and its intended spins. We have the team to do so. We have not been, nor will we be, distracted in delivering value for our shareholders. 
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A."

In fact, we had growth in all geographic areas, especially EMEA and Asia Pacific and also, this year, in Latin America. So hopeful that we're seeing a rebound in the developing economies right now. And our operating EBITDA is up 7% versus same quarter last year. Compared to previous quarter, pricing is up. Compared to same quarter last year, pricing's off about $0.01. So I think you're seeing that reflected; the polyethylene price reflects that robust demand. And then my point on inventories, I mean, the derivative demand is much tighter than the ethylene demand, and we think that's going to remain the case. In fact, we continue to see announcements of projects slide out of the pipeline. I reflected that in my comments. We continue to see delays forecasted, later start-ups, projects being completely taken out of the forecasts for ethylene. So I think, to your point about back half of the year, I think you're going to see more of the same that you have seen. We see a little bit of seasonality toward the end of the year, typically. But usually, third quarter is a strong quarter for us in Plastic franchise."

And I think we're going to continue to see Latin America come back. Obviously, the impact of the lower GDP has a little bit of a market sentimental impact on what happens with the consumer market. But when you look at the currency impacts in Latin America, and for that matter, in most of the developing world, most of the inflationary impacts, as those currency changes, have already been felt. And that's, I think, what leads into our comments that we think, in the emerging geographies, we're seeing a bottom and, hopefully, a recovery from this point on. Meanwhile, the United States -- given the energy feedstock competitiveness -- is still one of the lowest-cost places in the world to make these products. And so we still have the ability to export, based on our global reach, to all parts of the world. And based on the fact that we're focusing on the higher-value end markets, where most of the new capacity that's coming on is coming on in the really highly commoditized segments, it gives us the added benefit of the power of innovation. So when you look at that power of innovation and the competitiveness of scale that we have, I think we're well positioned to take advantage of this whole market situation. Relative to your point on our timing, our Sadara plants are up and the cracker is in the startup phase right now. In fact, the systems are running, and we're in the phase right before you really bring on the rest of the furnaces. We've got things inventoried in the hydrocarbons units, and we're drying out the rest of the plant and getting ready to go. So you're going to see polyethylene running here. And our hope is that polyethylene turns favorable, more of a tailwind, for the plastics business in the back half of the year. U.S. Gulf Coast, the cracker project is making tremendous progress. I think we're well above the 70% completion rate. And as we said, we're going to have that up by mid next year. And the polyethylene plants are coming along very nicely. I was just down in Plaquemine last month, and I have been down in Texas the last couple of months, and we're making tremendous progress on those. So I think our timing is very consistent with every previous report we've given you on those plants."

So when we get to the next administration and we engage, we'll engage on all the things that matter to the company, notably trade. Just a little reminder -- because I've been asked this question a few times, just a little reminder that the United States has actually put in very few trade agreements in the last 10 years, actually 3 specific bilats and one multi-lat in the works, but not yet done. So I would tell you, we haven't really been exposed to the positives of trade, and most of it is put the way Jim answered the other question, which is we're on the ground pretty much everywhere else. And so regionalization, the sum of all the places you're in, which is 37 countries for Dow, we're on the ground with physical facility in 37 countries means we have local market access under all sorts of trade environments. And there are great trade agreements going on between Asian countries and European Union and elsewhere, so we benefit from all of those. I would like to see the U.S. get to a multi-lat trade agreement -- the TPP, but we're not counting on it. I think what we're going to see here is a lot of uncertainties in the political environment. And I grew up in Asia, where there were trade barriers everywhere. So Dow has the strategy to operate and generate profit in economies that grow wherever there is growth. And we have the diversification of geographic mix to take a few countries being on the downside of growth, i.e. like Brazil right now, and of course, manage the upside, and like the U.S. and China right now. So I am not particularly concerned about the rhetoric that's going on right now."

And the addition of crash-durable adhesives, I can't underestimate how much of a growth driver that is for this business. Not just in -- I mean, we've highlighted our experience with Ford in the F150, where we're bonding aluminum to a steel structure, and not just light-weighting the vehicle but improving the crash-safety rating of that vehicle; a class of vehicle that's not known for high crash safety ratings. But that applies in other dissimilar materials. So whether you're talking about carbon fiber composites on a steel frame, that application still applies. And as we continue to see others focus on light-weighting -- and our driving force in automotive has been and continues to be a seat at the design table with the brand owners so that we can actually get out there and get our products spec-ed in -- we're continuing to see strong growth drivers in those businesses.

And as I just mentioned on Frank's question, we've produced over 500 million pounds of propylene out of that unit this year. The technology itself is working very well. The catalyst, the reactor performance was strong. In fact, the conversion rates are higher than we had expected out of the catalyst. So that all looks good. We had 2 operations -- unit operations inside the plant that gave us some trouble: one, heat exchanger, which we referred to earlier this year; and then we just had a problem with a drier bed in the unit, where we had to make some mechanical improvements in there. I don't think any of those are fundamental long-term problems. I think they're just the normal problems of startup of a massive unit -- and those of you who've been down there have seen the size of that thing. So we've got vendors and our support from the EOP [ph] all over it. And we're expected to be up next week, the week of August 8, and it's looking good right now. So we're very hopeful.

We're going to go open-market purchases. So we -- obviously, the next step is we need the trading window to open. As soon as the trading window opens, we do intend fully to buy back stock but within the volume limits that we have. And obviously, in the summer months, volume tends to be a little bit light. But we intend to buy as much as we possibly can in sync with DuPont, in line with the volume."

So we feel good about the back half. I mean, it's still going to be a tough -- still a tough Ag macro.

Jim alluded to sort of this point earlier in the call that over the last couple of months, we've sort of seen and heard a fair degree of cynicism around ethylene supply/demand fundamentals. But part and parcel with that cynicism is the feedstock side of things as well. There seems to be this perception that ethane is going to get tight very quickly, and I've heard numbers like $0.50 to $0.60 a gallon, imminently, being thrown around. Now you clearly have a slide in the deck talking about your views on ethane being long, so: a, would love for you to talk a bit about why you feel ethane is going to be long; and b, what sort of energy pricing stack are you using when you're coming up with your ethane supply/demand sort of analysis?"

I think it's a very good question, Hassan, and it's the reason we put that in the back of the deck. I'm glad you looked at that. I think a couple of things. Obviously, on the demand side for ethane, my comments about what's happening with project delays and things are sliding out the timing, impacts a little bit of that demand picture. But the power of feedstock flexibility here is what we always talk about in Dow, and one of the reasons we invest the way that we do is that propane and natural gas play a big role in this too. So propane right now is capping ethane, and the other dynamic that you see happening is that propane exports out of the U.S. are really flooding and exhausting some of the available buyers that are in that market. And natural gas prices are low. And the supply, even with the rig counts down, the supply has continued to be very strong, and now we're starting to see rig counts pick up a little bit. So our view here is that despite the exports, despite all the other things happening, you're still going to be long, propane and ethane, and you're going to be longer nat gas and propane than you are ethane. And when you're long propane and propanes in the crack slates, that's advantaged out. And so that's what we play for. Obviously, we have the flexibility to go back into ethane when that's possible. But look, there's more gas supply at low cost that's coming on every day not just in the U.S., it's coming on in the Middle East. It's in Australia. It's putting pressure on these gas prices, and that's going to help us out."

And there's been corrections out there because the view is -- the basis of your question, Hassan, is that, in some way, where naphtha is versus ethane, where naphtha is versus propane, is linked to where oil is versus gas. And what we have seen and what we've said and what we've now performed against under these diverse environments is: firstly, our geographic mix helps us; secondly, our feedstock flexibility enables us; thirdly, we've added to that flexibility, i.e. propane in Europe for a great example of that, and we see propane as long as far as the eye can see; and lastly and very importantly, low oil price over time has enabled consumer demand. It took a while, but it's here. U.S. consumers are spending because they've got more money in their pockets. That's also happening in countries like China, which is becoming more consumer-led. So a low oil price with the enablement of feedstock flexibility on the Dow side, with ethane, propane, some butane, certainly in the U.S., and our feedstock flexibility engine in the Europe means we can maximize profits in the chain; that key slide that Jim had in his deck. So we can make money as long as there is demand. The feedstock input/output thing, we are managing to maximize profit, maximize margin, which is a price-volume trade-off in that chain. And we're doing it successfully now under all environments."

We have the portfolio to keep performing and keep strong performance, but we're not resting there. Self-help actions for the last many years on reducing costs, taking productivity to the bottom line, keeping it sticky. The 2,500 positions we are reducing, i.e. the 700 extra on top of the Dow Corning announcement, is a great example of how we're continuing to work the cost engine, not just feedstocks but actual costs, so that we can stay in a margin-expansion mode now 15 in a row. This is not only yielded margin but the working capital side of this. You got to look at what we've done. We produced 1 billion more pounds in the quarter from a year ago, 2 billion pounds more from the same machine from the first half point of view. Those extra pounds, and that's high operating rate, and disciplined working capital is generating this extra free cash flow that will feed the share buyback question that Howard answered. And we're very committed the working capital management, cash flow management, free cash flow generation to keep working the balance sheet so we can increase share buybacks. 
And then this strong demand environment will continue. Look, it's not a great global economy, but it's a consumer-led economy, and our products speak to it. And our new plants will come online at the right time. So all of our interventions and actions are producing and they continue to produce. 
Dow Corning -- accretive in the first month, synergies raise already. The merger -- on track. And with a great see-through to these 3 new entities, these 3 great growth entities. We're firing on all cylinders, and we will continue to do so."

The Dow team continues to deliver against every one of our goals for the year, building on our consistent track record of execution. 
Let's start with the financial highlight. We achieved record third quarter EBITDA and our highest third quarter EPS in a decade. This quarter marked 4 full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition, we returned more than $900 million of cash to our owners through stock buybacks and dividends. 
Operationally, we continue to meet consumer-led demand for Dow products and solution, driving volume gains in all geographies. We've now consistently grown volume over 3 years, 12 consecutive quarters, despite a slow-growth macro environment. 
We also delivered another quarter of productivity and cost savings, bringing the year-to-date contribution to $254 million, on track to exceed our 2016 target.
On our strategic projects, we accelerated the Dow Corning integration, moving quickly on our cost synergies, as we said we would. Our Sadara joint venture celebrated the startup of its multi-feed crackup and a third polyethylene train. And our next wave of U.S. Gulf Coast projects is on the cusp of delivering bottom line results. 
Dow's proven time and again the power and resilience of our business model, our focused market participation that shows resiliency in all environments, our commitment to self-help productivity and cost-cutting and the compelling upside from our strategic investments. Collectively, these drivers will deliver the next levels of earnings and cash flow growth and delivering that cash to our owners. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard to discuss our financial performance, the Dow Corning integration, modeling guidance and our Ag results. Jim will cover the remaining businesses. And I'll close with some thoughts on our track record of success and our future growth trajectory.

Turning to Slide 5. We had a number of important financial achievements in the quarter. We delivered operating EPS of $0.91, an 11% increase. We achieved record third quarter operating EBITDA of $2.5 billion, up $118 million, and we expanded our operating EBITDA margin to 20%. Our earnings expansion was driven by our consumer-oriented businesses, which features strong results with the integration of Dow Corning and better-than-expected performance in Dow Ag. We grew volume in every geographic area in the quarter, with notable strength in Europe, which was up 9%; and the United States and China, both up 6%. Productivity continued to be an important contributor. We delivered another $76 million of savings in the quarter. And finally, we resumed our share buyback program, with more than $400 million of share repurchases in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6 and an update on Dow Corning. Since close, we have been working quickly to integrate the Silicones platform into our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions businesses, as well as capturing the synergies. The quick wins we've already delivered underscore the power of the Silicones franchise, its highly complementary hand-in-glove fit with Dow's business model and the role this transaction plays in further enhancing our earnings growth profile.
First and foremost, the core business continues to outperform even our initial projections on broad-based volume gains and share growth. 
Second, I'm pleased to report that we've already reached more than $200 million in cost synergies on an annual run-rate basis. This was largely due to the value our team has extracted in purchasing, optimizing our warehouse and logistic footprints, as well as consolidating back-office operations.
We've also completed notifications with the vast majority of impacted roles, with only a small percentage remaining, where we're adhering to local labor rules. 
We remain on track to achieve a run rate of 70% against our $400 million cost synergy target by the first half of 2017 and 100% by the first half of '18. 
And finally, we're also seeing the power of Silicones on the growth side of the equation. As we've said for some time, Dow Corning Silicones is a natural fit into Dow's packaging, transportation, infrastructure and consumer care end markets. We are even more positive today about the growth synergy opportunities that this transaction presents. Our commercial and R&D teams finalized a playbook to achieve the $100 million growth synergy target, and in fact, we've already delivered some early cross-selling opportunities.
Bottom line, the Dow Corning integration is progressing very well, delivering financial returns, uncovering future growth opportunities and enhancing Dow's market-focused portfolio. 
Before we turn to our segment results, let me share some thoughts on modeling guidance on Slide 7.
In the fourth quarter, we expect ag market headwinds to persist, largely offset by our self-help actions. Comparing year-over-year, recall that we sold several nonstrategic molecules last year, which lifted Ag results in that period. 
Consumer Solutions will benefit from the integration of Dow Corning. Approximately 60% of Dow Corning's EBITDA and synergies are in this segment. We do expect typical seasonality in Electronic Materials and U.S. auto production as we approach year end. 
In Infrastructure Solutions, my comments about Dow Corning apply here as well, with the other 40% of its EBITDA generated here. This segment also consumes roughly 1/3 of the propylene from our PDH unit. We expect that to be offset by continued oil and gas headwinds in Energy & Water.
Turning to Performance Materials & Chemicals, which consumes 2/3 of the propylene from our PDH unit. From a seasonality standpoint, we could see some upside from deicer sales. After all, it did snow yesterday in Michigan. As you know, we have seen compression on the integrated EO and PO margins globally, which will impact PMC. Also, Sadara costs are increasing here as we continue to start up downstream units related to this segment. 
Finally, in Performance Plastics, we expect a modest uptick from the cracker and the 3 PE units at Sadara, as sales have begun. However, we expect these to be more than offset by higher costs from the Louisiana turnaround, debottleneck and maintenance activities currently underway, as well as higher feedstock cost globally.
Now let's turn to our segments. I'll start first with Ag on Slide 9 and then hand it to Jim to cover the rest of the businesses. 
Dow Ag continues to outperform despite the ongoing challenging industry fundamentals. Segment EBITDA increased by $141 million and represents the best third quarter result in nearly a decade. Several factors contributed to our success: Share gains due to continued increasing demand for our innovative products, price improvements, continued self-help actions and strong early demand for the Latin America growing season.
Latin America seeds was the highlight. Strong demand in the region drove record sales, with price and volume both rising by double digits. Corn seed sales nearly tripled, primarily on double-digit volume and price growth in Latin America. The business increased share, particularly in the Brazilian safrina season, where we have a strong position. Soybean sales nearly tripled as well, reflecting higher price and volume. 
Crop Protection set a third quarter EBITDA record, supported by improved product mix and ongoing self-help productivity and cost-cutting actions. Insecticides improved on increased price, while herbicide pricing and fungicide volume each declined. 
I'll now turn it over to Jim to cover the rest of our segments."

This",662,"Thank you, Howard. Moving to Consumer Solutions on Slide 10. The segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record of $492 million, boosted by the integration of Dow Corning, which is further enhancing our end market positions across the segment. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth for this segment, and it demonstrates the power and differentiation of our consumer, automotive and Electronic Materials franchises. 
Dow Automotive achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth and a record third quarter EBITDA, led by double-digit volume gains in Asia Pacific on new business wins and market share gains. The business continues to grow above market on demand for Dow's light-weighting solution. 
Consumer Care grew market share through gains in homecare market sectors and new innovations for personal hygiene solutions. 
Silicones in the Consumer Solutions segment delivered double-digit volume growth in Asia Pacific behind demand for electronic and automotive applications. The business also achieved its first cross-selling opportunities with the Dow Automotive, Consumer Care and Polyurethanes businesses. 
And Dow Electronic Materials achieved record quarterly EBITDA. In addition to ongoing self-help measures, the business captured strong demand in semiconductor, interconnect and Display Technologies, particularly in Asia Pacific. 
On Slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions delivered EBITDA of $379 million, primarily reflecting the integration of Dow Corning. 
Dow Building & Construction achieved record third quarter EBITDA and delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth. The business captured volume gains on demands for acrylic-based construction chemicals and benefited from continued voluntary adoption of our BLUEDGE polymeric flame retardant. 
Silicones in the Infrastructure Solutions segment reported volume and EBITDA growth, driven by improved demand in packaging and building construction applications. 
Dow Coating Materials reported volume growth in all market segments, led by strong demand in Asia Pacific and gains in both the architectural and industrial coatings sectors.
Moving to Slide 12. Performance and Materials Chemicals EBITDA declined, primarily due to the impact of portfolio actions, which included divestitures and the reduced ownership in MEGlobal, as well as higher Sadara startup cost. In the core business, pricing pressures led to unit margin compression, but this was partly offset by volume growth. 
In Polyurethanes, we achieved record volume on double-digit gains in specialty polyols and systems houses, led by growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Industrial Solutions reported volume gains in all businesses, also led by strength in EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Turning to Performance Plastics on Slide 13. The team achieved $1.25 billion of EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, with gains across all businesses. A key part of our continued success is the team's focus on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment.
Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered record third quarter sales volume on double-digit growth in developed geographies and adoption of new innovations for food and specialty packaging applications. 
Dow Elastomers also achieved record third quarter volume, driven by increasing global consumer preference for larger vehicles that incorporate more Dow content, as well as double-digit growth in athletic footwear. These applications are further enhanced by our innovative products, such as INTUNE and INFUSE olefin block copolymers.
Dow Electrical and Telecommunications reported double-digit volume gains in the Americas, as the business continues to benefit from the global trends toward fiber optic cabling for faster and more reliable wireless connections.
Additionally, Sadara started up its multi-feed cracker in August and a third polyethylene train in September, adding to the 2 polyethylene trains already in operation. 
In the U.S. Gulf Coast, we commenced the Louisiana turnaround and feedstock flexibility project. That unit will restart later this quarter, giving our LA-3 cracker the ability to produce an additional 250,000 tons per year of ethylene and enhancing the reliability of one of the best units in our fleet.
During the quarter, our Texas-9 ethylene facility has 85% mechanical completion, and we made significant progress on our Performance Plastics production facilities. Our target for Texas-9 to come online remains mid-2017.
And now I'll hand it back over to Andrew."

And there's a chart here that you should pay particular attention to, the one on the right of the slide. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we've now achieved for 4 full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. And we've been doing earnings growth now for over a decade. You can see that we have taken a series of purposeful steps taken over these past many years. These steps are deeply rooted in our strategy to get to the near term right and the long term right and steadfast execution from an aligned Team Dow. 
And to put things into context, you actually have to go back to the late 1990s, when our industry came under pressure from state-owned enterprises. Returns were clearly impacted because we all had, Dow included, a me-too product wheel. Low-cost integration was absolutely necessary, but on its own, not enough to ensure long-term profitable growth. 
Since then, we've taken a number of decisive actions to create a sustainable business model, building on both low-cost integration and innovation to drive our narrower and deeper focus in attractive end markets; to invest for growth in consumer-led sectors while having a strong presence in investment-driven markets, like infrastructure; and to control what we can control through disciplined productivity and cost saving. In doing so, we believe we've created a portfolio for all seasons, a more resilient portfolio, one built to grow and last. 
We have fundamentally shifted our earnings trajectory, not only enhancing our growth, but also driving greater consistency. Equally important, we have put in place a series of growth drivers that will serve us well in the near and long term. These include: A reinvigorated, industry-leading R&D engine which now delivers over 5,000 new products every year; a new set of technical capabilities, most notably the addition of Dow Corning Silicones; an expanded footprint in attractive global markets through our investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Middle East and Asia, positioning us to grow where growth exists; and finally, a low-cost structure that has productivity wired into its very core. These drivers will further enhance our market focus, continue to reduce our volatility, bolster our integration and our innovation and ultimately maximize shareholder value creation.
Flipping to Slide 16. Of course, the ultimate proof of our business model is the enhanced returns Team Dow has delivered: Earnings growth, enhanced cash flow and higher shareholder returns. And going forward, our team remains relentlessly focused on our priorities: Delivering the operating and financial plan, accelerating earnings growth and value creation through the continued integration of Dow Corning and advancing through the DowDuPont transaction and intended wins. 
And we will do so despite persistent macro uncertainties. As I've said before, regional economic trends are mixed at best. North America and Europe show measured growth, with Dow products growing stronger than the market. Latin America, especially Brazil, which is beginning to recover, is a slow-growth environment. However, we do see bright spots there, particularly the Andean economies and Mexico. And economic transitions are underway in Asia, notably China. In this environment, we will continue to find growth where growth exists. That includes our core consumer-led markets of packaging, automotive and construction. 
As we establish the foundation for the new Dow, we have the right tools in hand to build the world's leading material science company. And our 4-year streak, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion fuels our excitement for the future. 
In closing, on Slide 17, we have not, nor will we, lose sight of our priorities. Dow will continue to deliver through our focused portfolio, our integration, our innovation and our geographic reach, through our relentless focus on our execution and on maximizing value creation for our customers, for our shareholders, for the near term and for the long term. 
With that, Neal, let's turn it to Q&A."

So where things are weak is in the industrial economy around the world. But where things are strong is safety drivers, hygiene drivers, environmental drivers and, actually, consumer drivers. And I think our product mix, especially with Dow Corning now added in, which has given us new growth synergies, is doubled down and tripled down on that part of the portfolio.

Our view is that propane is still long, and propane is Dow's big advantage in feedstock flexibility. Propane is still long for some time to come.

So the Louisiana 3 turnaround, the majority of that cost comes in this quarter. And we expect that unit to be up some time mid-November. That is not just a turnaround, but it's also tying in the ethylene -- the ethane cracking flexibility, which is both front-end on the furnaces and back-end on the distillation section and separation section of the plant. So that's a big turnaround. You still got Sadara startup costs for another polyethylene that comes -- train that comes up in first quarter. So those are neither one in last year. The other example I would give you is, when you look at this quarter and third quarter, if you look at the margin compression year-over-year, half of that is from Sadara startup costs and the beginning of the LA-3 turnaround. So I don't we're foretelling that there's a big margin compression coming here or there's big drop-off in demand. I think it's really more related to one-off items. We've also been doing turnarounds in our polyethylene derivatives space. So in Seadrift, where we're heavy on electrical and telecom capacity, we've been doing some turnarounds and debottlenecks and reliability work there. We're doing the similar types of things in St. Charles in our LP-6 plant.

PDH today is still running very positive cash margins, even in a low propylene environment is running very positive cash margins. LA-3, the real EBITDA incremental from LA-3 is the fact you get 250,000 [ph] tons a year more ethylene out of that. So that's right to our bottom line. That's produced for us versus purchased. So that goes to the bottom line. And Texas 9 and derivatives is a whole new slate of products. It's really 4 of our highest value-add derivatives plants on that franchise. It's our highest growing segments of your going to continue to ship the mix year up in the higher-performing products and away from the most commoditized parts of earnings.

This company, the next slide I did in the deck shows consistent earnings growth with the plastics profile having obviously a good effect, but it doesn't wobble the company as much as it used to because of the value-add that Jim finished on. Plus, the forecast going forward on supply side shows more of a plateau in these next few years despite the supply adds because of the delays.

So our production is up versus the same quarter last year, up 9%. That's 1.9 billion pounds that we've sold in Q3 that we didn't sell a year ago. Year-to-date, that number is 5.6 billion pounds. So kudos to our operations people. They're running safely. They're running reliably. And our sales people have been able to get it out the door and move more volume to demand based on value-add and, therefore, kept inventories quite low. So this machine is moving into the high 80s operating rate, right now, at 86%, as a totality of Dow, not just at the integration piece that I'm referring. I'm talking about the whole company. And so the value-add piece, when you think about innovation agenda, stretches across all of it, from the propylene derivatives, to the ethylene derivatives, to the silicones derivatives, all the value-add piece. And very few of our businesses today are reselling the strict monomer. Probably the last remaining example of that is our acrylic chains, our performers polymer, where we are moving, riding all those monomers down to Goliad polymers and promotions. That's the last part of the Dow commodity engine that self-interest commodities."

I have no confidence that they're going to allocate capital to coal or emissions heavy investments. I think there will be some of that but these are massive capital investments that have the problem of not being forecastable in terms of returns, and that's the other point. I believe certain enterprises got this from, literally, the top leadership under huge pressure to show returns. And they are having, in essence, a [indiscernible] moment in terms of understanding how capital gets allocated between equity, property and other investments. It's much more western financial environment appearing there, especially as they open up the financial sector, which there pretty much are committing to do.

I mean, $141 million improvement versus I break down the drivers into 3 buckets, and it was pretty much equally split. About 1/3 was due to the higher volumes and higher prices and specifically, seed in Brazil for sure. About 1/3 came from just the continued drumbeat, steady drumbeat now, for many quarters in a row on self-help productivity and cost-cutting. And then the other 1/3 was really by the turnaround in currency if you think about a year ago, there were pretty big currency headwinds facing loss in Ag, and it didn't help much. Actually, in the quarter, actually, I think it was 1 percentage point of the price up was related to currency in Ag. And the company level, currency was 0 help to us. But it helped on the margin, and certainly, the delta changed. That was the other 1/3 of the key drivers. I mean, when you think about why the volume was up in seeds in Brazil, I would say a couple of things: one, just the continued development of our new technologies that we continue to introduce, that farmers continue to get more and more comfortable that it does what it says, and it increases their yield. And so they just continued to get used to it. I do think there was some early buying in the quarter. I mean, the farmers, we don't get to choose the weather, the farmers decide when they get the plant, and I do think there was some of that. That will be a Q3 versus a Q4 move. So I would not count all of that as a Q3 gain. But we feel good about where we ended up in the quarter."

It hasn't been a lot. Remember, 1,500 rigs were moved out of production, and you've got about 11 to 15 that are moved back in. But it is a move, and it's starting that direction so there is cautious optimizing there. I think as -- if prices continue to firm up on oil, they continue to firm up toward the $55, maybe even next year into the $60 range, you're going to see more rigs coming back in. So gas is going to be competitive. Some of these fields can be competitive at $25 a barrel. So I think we've got a situation, which is good for us that the U.S. is competitive, and it's going to be there longer. And so when you look at where our assets are around the world, it's a very good competitive cost positions basis to have our franchise. As far as supply-demand balance is and the numbers that are in here, we're still running at the traditional 1 3 [ph], 1 4x GDP types of numbers for demand, and the real question mark is what's the GDP number that you plug into there. I would say the beginning of the year, we were starting with something like a 3% global GDP, and we've backed off of that some through the year, more towards goal of 2.5% number. But look, we've had 6% growth all year, and we've also had between 6% and 10% in China year-over-year. We operated in kind of the 4% range in North America, similar, maybe a little bit stronger in Europe and kind of flat in Latin America. So our view going forward is these operating rates are strong, and it's not just reflective of the fact that you've got the historical rates. It's also sustainable packaging is driving a lot of transitory plastics, and that's competing against other materials, and we're not getting materials out. So I think the sustainability trends are helping us stay there."

So agricultural lobbies and farm lobbies are strong everywhere, and of course, great unlevel playing field around the world. That's why some jurisdictions will have GMOs and some with GMOs. There's some jurisdictions that have trade protection barriers and some that don't. So this is not a new conversation. Eyes wide open going to our transaction, as you all know, you in particular, about 10 years of asking the question, what are you going to do with Ag? We always felt that there was a complementarity between biology and chemistry and integrated farm science helping the farmers. Integrated farm science, including Big Data, is expensive. And R&D to fuel that has to be funded in a public company over long cycles. In short-cycle investment thesis, many people have patient money for long-cycle investment. The smart scale of innovation and procompetitiveness for farmers to get the very best out of their plot of line, whether it's an acre or 10,000 acres, raw crops and niche crops and the sites needed to get more food, safe, reliable food to all the citizens of those countries, it is the mission at hand with our deal. And frankly, I'm sure it's the mission with other deals. We are first in all jurisdictions. We are very eyes wide open on what it means to create a procompetitive farm lobby, and we believe our deal does that. And if there are pushbacks based on various views on how those innovations come to market, we will definitely engage and are engaging. Again, we are taking the time to listen very carefully to what the jurisdictions want us to do, and we are very, very thoughtful on those remedies and we are confident will close this deal in Q1 and, frankly, sold that complex equation that you asked about a globally, of particular or not."

At the same time, on the ground in Sadara, within the joint venture, they're working hard to get their cost positions where it needs to be and get their comps where they need to be to be competitive as a JV in their own right. So I think both of those things are going to have an impact to 2018. I already said, we expect plastics to show positive next year.

So I think the issue is where we're playing in automotive. When you look at the number of applications that we're in, whether it's our plastics products, engaged things like bumper for the cars, our lightweighting solutions like our crash durable adhesives. So as companies continue to use carbon fiber, aluminum, other things, to bond to the steel frames, they need for adhesives in that the goal. And when you get to it, we look at content per vehicle. So even though, in some areas, production in automotive year-over-year has flattened out, we're expanding our content per vehicle in that space, and I think that's what's driving the growth for us. Elastomers is a big product line that sells a lot into the automotive sector. Coatings as well into areas like sound dampening for the car is an area that people sometimes don't appreciate how much content goes into the automotive space. So that's how we're growing better than market is really getting the content per vehicle up and getting the number of solutions on the new vehicles up. And as you go into the heavier vehicles, in trucks, you get into crossovers and higher-performing vehicles like the higher-performing sedan, the ones that people more value for, we have more content on those vehicles then say the entry-level sedan."

The Dow team continues to deliver against every one of our goals for the year, building on our consistent track record of execution. 
Let's start with the financial highlight. We achieved record third quarter EBITDA and our highest third quarter EPS in a decade. This quarter marked 4 full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition, we returned more than $900 million of cash to our owners through stock buybacks and dividends. 
Operationally, we continue to meet consumer-led demand for Dow products and solution, driving volume gains in all geographies. We've now consistently grown volume over 3 years, 12 consecutive quarters, despite a slow-growth macro environment. 
We also delivered another quarter of productivity and cost savings, bringing the year-to-date contribution to $254 million, on track to exceed our 2016 target.
On our strategic projects, we accelerated the Dow Corning integration, moving quickly on our cost synergies, as we said we would. Our Sadara joint venture celebrated the startup of its multi-feed crackup and a third polyethylene train. And our next wave of U.S. Gulf Coast projects is on the cusp of delivering bottom line results. 
Dow's proven time and again the power and resilience of our business model, our focused market participation that shows resiliency in all environments, our commitment to self-help productivity and cost-cutting and the compelling upside from our strategic investments. Collectively, these drivers will deliver the next levels of earnings and cash flow growth and delivering that cash to our owners. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard to discuss our financial performance, the Dow Corning integration, modeling guidance and our Ag results. Jim will cover the remaining businesses. And I'll close with some thoughts on our track record of success and our future growth trajectory.

Turning to Slide 5. We had a number of important financial achievements in the quarter. We delivered operating EPS of $0.91, an 11% increase. We achieved record third quarter operating EBITDA of $2.5 billion, up $118 million, and we expanded our operating EBITDA margin to 20%. Our earnings expansion was driven by our consumer-oriented businesses, which features strong results with the integration of Dow Corning and better-than-expected performance in Dow Ag. We grew volume in every geographic area in the quarter, with notable strength in Europe, which was up 9%; and the United States and China, both up 6%. Productivity continued to be an important contributor. We delivered another $76 million of savings in the quarter. And finally, we resumed our share buyback program, with more than $400 million of share repurchases in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6 and an update on Dow Corning. Since close, we have been working quickly to integrate the Silicones platform into our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions businesses, as well as capturing the synergies. The quick wins we've already delivered underscore the power of the Silicones franchise, its highly complementary hand-in-glove fit with Dow's business model and the role this transaction plays in further enhancing our earnings growth profile.
First and foremost, the core business continues to outperform even our initial projections on broad-based volume gains and share growth. 
Second, I'm pleased to report that we've already reached more than $200 million in cost synergies on an annual run-rate basis. This was largely due to the value our team has extracted in purchasing, optimizing our warehouse and logistic footprints, as well as consolidating back-office operations.
We've also completed notifications with the vast majority of impacted roles, with only a small percentage remaining, where we're adhering to local labor rules. 
We remain on track to achieve a run rate of 70% against our $400 million cost synergy target by the first half of 2017 and 100% by the first half of '18. 
And finally, we're also seeing the power of Silicones on the growth side of the equation. As we've said for some time, Dow Corning Silicones is a natural fit into Dow's packaging, transportation, infrastructure and consumer care end markets. We are even more positive today about the growth synergy opportunities that this transaction presents. Our commercial and R&D teams finalized a playbook to achieve the $100 million growth synergy target, and in fact, we've already delivered some early cross-selling opportunities.
Bottom line, the Dow Corning integration is progressing very well, delivering financial returns, uncovering future growth opportunities and enhancing Dow's market-focused portfolio. 
Before we turn to our segment results, let me share some thoughts on modeling guidance on Slide 7.
In the fourth quarter, we expect ag market headwinds to persist, largely offset by our self-help actions. Comparing year-over-year, recall that we sold several nonstrategic molecules last year, which lifted Ag results in that period. 
Consumer Solutions will benefit from the integration of Dow Corning. Approximately 60% of Dow Corning's EBITDA and synergies are in this segment. We do expect typical seasonality in Electronic Materials and U.S. auto production as we approach year end. 
In Infrastructure Solutions, my comments about Dow Corning apply here as well, with the other 40% of its EBITDA generated here. This segment also consumes roughly 1/3 of the propylene from our PDH unit. We expect that to be offset by continued oil and gas headwinds in Energy & Water.
Turning to Performance Materials & Chemicals, which consumes 2/3 of the propylene from our PDH unit. From a seasonality standpoint, we could see some upside from deicer sales. After all, it did snow yesterday in Michigan. As you know, we have seen compression on the integrated EO and PO margins globally, which will impact PMC. Also, Sadara costs are increasing here as we continue to start up downstream units related to this segment. 
Finally, in Performance Plastics, we expect a modest uptick from the cracker and the 3 PE units at Sadara, as sales have begun. However, we expect these to be more than offset by higher costs from the Louisiana turnaround, debottleneck and maintenance activities currently underway, as well as higher feedstock cost globally.
Now let's turn to our segments. I'll start first with Ag on Slide 9 and then hand it to Jim to cover the rest of the businesses. 
Dow Ag continues to outperform despite the ongoing challenging industry fundamentals. Segment EBITDA increased by $141 million and represents the best third quarter result in nearly a decade. Several factors contributed to our success: Share gains due to continued increasing demand for our innovative products, price improvements, continued self-help actions and strong early demand for the Latin America growing season.
Latin America seeds was the highlight. Strong demand in the region drove record sales, with price and volume both rising by double digits. Corn seed sales nearly tripled, primarily on double-digit volume and price growth in Latin America. The business increased share, particularly in the Brazilian safrina season, where we have a strong position. Soybean sales nearly tripled as well, reflecting higher price and volume. 
Crop Protection set a third quarter EBITDA record, supported by improved product mix and ongoing self-help productivity and cost-cutting actions. Insecticides improved on increased price, while herbicide pricing and fungicide volume each declined. 
I'll now turn it over to Jim to cover the rest of our segments."

This",662,"Thank you, Howard. Moving to Consumer Solutions on Slide 10. The segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record of $492 million, boosted by the integration of Dow Corning, which is further enhancing our end market positions across the segment. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth for this segment, and it demonstrates the power and differentiation of our consumer, automotive and Electronic Materials franchises. 
Dow Automotive achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth and a record third quarter EBITDA, led by double-digit volume gains in Asia Pacific on new business wins and market share gains. The business continues to grow above market on demand for Dow's light-weighting solution. 
Consumer Care grew market share through gains in homecare market sectors and new innovations for personal hygiene solutions. 
Silicones in the Consumer Solutions segment delivered double-digit volume growth in Asia Pacific behind demand for electronic and automotive applications. The business also achieved its first cross-selling opportunities with the Dow Automotive, Consumer Care and Polyurethanes businesses. 
And Dow Electronic Materials achieved record quarterly EBITDA. In addition to ongoing self-help measures, the business captured strong demand in semiconductor, interconnect and Display Technologies, particularly in Asia Pacific. 
On Slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions delivered EBITDA of $379 million, primarily reflecting the integration of Dow Corning. 
Dow Building & Construction achieved record third quarter EBITDA and delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth. The business captured volume gains on demands for acrylic-based construction chemicals and benefited from continued voluntary adoption of our BLUEDGE polymeric flame retardant. 
Silicones in the Infrastructure Solutions segment reported volume and EBITDA growth, driven by improved demand in packaging and building construction applications. 
Dow Coating Materials reported volume growth in all market segments, led by strong demand in Asia Pacific and gains in both the architectural and industrial coatings sectors.
Moving to Slide 12. Performance and Materials Chemicals EBITDA declined, primarily due to the impact of portfolio actions, which included divestitures and the reduced ownership in MEGlobal, as well as higher Sadara startup cost. In the core business, pricing pressures led to unit margin compression, but this was partly offset by volume growth. 
In Polyurethanes, we achieved record volume on double-digit gains in specialty polyols and systems houses, led by growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Industrial Solutions reported volume gains in all businesses, also led by strength in EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Turning to Performance Plastics on Slide 13. The team achieved $1.25 billion of EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, with gains across all businesses. A key part of our continued success is the team's focus on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment.
Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered record third quarter sales volume on double-digit growth in developed geographies and adoption of new innovations for food and specialty packaging applications. 
Dow Elastomers also achieved record third quarter volume, driven by increasing global consumer preference for larger vehicles that incorporate more Dow content, as well as double-digit growth in athletic footwear. These applications are further enhanced by our innovative products, such as INTUNE and INFUSE olefin block copolymers.
Dow Electrical and Telecommunications reported double-digit volume gains in the Americas, as the business continues to benefit from the global trends toward fiber optic cabling for faster and more reliable wireless connections.
Additionally, Sadara started up its multi-feed cracker in August and a third polyethylene train in September, adding to the 2 polyethylene trains already in operation. 
In the U.S. Gulf Coast, we commenced the Louisiana turnaround and feedstock flexibility project. That unit will restart later this quarter, giving our LA-3 cracker the ability to produce an additional 250,000 tons per year of ethylene and enhancing the reliability of one of the best units in our fleet.
During the quarter, our Texas-9 ethylene facility has 85% mechanical completion, and we made significant progress on our Performance Plastics production facilities. Our target for Texas-9 to come online remains mid-2017.
And now I'll hand it back over to Andrew."

And there's a chart here that you should pay particular attention to, the one on the right of the slide. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we've now achieved for 4 full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. And we've been doing earnings growth now for over a decade. You can see that we have taken a series of purposeful steps taken over these past many years. These steps are deeply rooted in our strategy to get to the near term right and the long term right and steadfast execution from an aligned Team Dow. 
And to put things into context, you actually have to go back to the late 1990s, when our industry came under pressure from state-owned enterprises. Returns were clearly impacted because we all had, Dow included, a me-too product wheel. Low-cost integration was absolutely necessary, but on its own, not enough to ensure long-term profitable growth. 
Since then, we've taken a number of decisive actions to create a sustainable business model, building on both low-cost integration and innovation to drive our narrower and deeper focus in attractive end markets; to invest for growth in consumer-led sectors while having a strong presence in investment-driven markets, like infrastructure; and to control what we can control through disciplined productivity and cost saving. In doing so, we believe we've created a portfolio for all seasons, a more resilient portfolio, one built to grow and last. 
We have fundamentally shifted our earnings trajectory, not only enhancing our growth, but also driving greater consistency. Equally important, we have put in place a series of growth drivers that will serve us well in the near and long term. These include: A reinvigorated, industry-leading R&D engine which now delivers over 5,000 new products every year; a new set of technical capabilities, most notably the addition of Dow Corning Silicones; an expanded footprint in attractive global markets through our investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Middle East and Asia, positioning us to grow where growth exists; and finally, a low-cost structure that has productivity wired into its very core. These drivers will further enhance our market focus, continue to reduce our volatility, bolster our integration and our innovation and ultimately maximize shareholder value creation.
Flipping to Slide 16. Of course, the ultimate proof of our business model is the enhanced returns Team Dow has delivered: Earnings growth, enhanced cash flow and higher shareholder returns. And going forward, our team remains relentlessly focused on our priorities: Delivering the operating and financial plan, accelerating earnings growth and value creation through the continued integration of Dow Corning and advancing through the DowDuPont transaction and intended wins. 
And we will do so despite persistent macro uncertainties. As I've said before, regional economic trends are mixed at best. North America and Europe show measured growth, with Dow products growing stronger than the market. Latin America, especially Brazil, which is beginning to recover, is a slow-growth environment. However, we do see bright spots there, particularly the Andean economies and Mexico. And economic transitions are underway in Asia, notably China. In this environment, we will continue to find growth where growth exists. That includes our core consumer-led markets of packaging, automotive and construction. 
As we establish the foundation for the new Dow, we have the right tools in hand to build the world's leading material science company. And our 4-year streak, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion fuels our excitement for the future. 
In closing, on Slide 17, we have not, nor will we, lose sight of our priorities. Dow will continue to deliver through our focused portfolio, our integration, our innovation and our geographic reach, through our relentless focus on our execution and on maximizing value creation for our customers, for our shareholders, for the near term and for the long term. 
With that, Neal, let's turn it to Q&A."

So the Louisiana 3 turnaround, the majority of that cost comes in this quarter. And we expect that unit to be up some time mid-November. That is not just a turnaround, but it's also tying in the ethylene -- the ethane cracking flexibility, which is both front-end on the furnaces and back-end on the distillation section and separation section of the plant. So that's a big turnaround. You still got Sadara startup costs for another polyethylene that comes -- train that comes up in first quarter. So those are neither one in last year. The other example I would give you is, when you look at this quarter and third quarter, if you look at the margin compression year-over-year, half of that is from Sadara startup costs and the beginning of the LA-3 turnaround. So I don't we're foretelling that there's a big margin compression coming here or there's big drop-off in demand. I think it's really more related to one-off items. We've also been doing turnarounds in our polyethylene derivatives space. So in Seadrift, where we're heavy on electrical and telecom capacity, we've been doing some turnarounds and debottlenecks and reliability work there. We're doing the similar types of things in St. Charles in our LP-6 plant.

PDH today is still running very positive cash margins, even in a low propylene environment, is running very positive cash margins. LA-3, the real EBITDA increment from LA-3 is the fact you get 250,000 tons a year more ethylene out of that. So that's right to our bottom line. That's produced for us versus purchased. So that goes to the bottom line. And Texas-9 and derivatives is a whole new slate of products. It's really 4 of our highest value-add derivatives plants on that franchise and it's our highest-growing segment. So we're going to continue to shift the mix here up in the higher-performing products and away from the most commoditized parts of the earnings.

Plus, the forecast going forward on supply side shows more of a plateau in these next few years despite these supply adds because of the delays.

And then I would say the rest of it is the latter part. The mix shift and the value-add from the mix shift is the big thing. There really hasn't been enough time to have enough of an impact from new capacity. As Sadara starts up, you've got to fill that supply chain to get the product out, so we've been moving a lot of product out into that supply chain. We sold some material, as was discussed earlier, in the third quarter in the month of September. However, you're going to see more of those sales come in the fourth quarter, as we got 3 units running and getting that supply chain full.

But just on the big energy picture as it relates to China, in particular. I was just over there, as I indicated. I would tell you China is deindustrializing very fast, Hassan. I have no confidence that they're going to allocate capital to coal or emissions-heavy investments. I think there will be some of that, but these are massive capital investments that have the problem of not being forecastable in terms of returns, and that's the other point. I believe certain enterprises, I've got this from literally the top leadership, are under huge pressure to show returns. And they are having, in essence, a come-to-jesus moment in terms of understanding how capital gets allocated between equity, property and other investments. It's much more western financial environment appearing there, especially as they open up the financial sector, which they pretty much are committing to do. I think that recalibration in China is going to slow down coal-heavy investments with time. The paradox there is I think they're going to much heavier into nuclear. I think that's going to be their place of choice while they transition to LNG.

I mean, that $141 million improvement versus same quarter year ago, I'd break down the drivers into 3 buckets and it was pretty much equally split. About 1/3 was due to the higher volumes and higher prices, and specifically, seed in Brazil for sure. About 1/3 came from just the continued drumbeat, steady drumbeat now for many quarters in a row, on self-help productivity and cost-cutting. And then the other 1/3 was really by the turnaround in currency. If you think about a year ago, there were pretty big currency headwinds facing us in Ag. And it didn't help much. Actually in the quarter, I think it was 1 percentage point of the price up was related to currency in Ag. And actually overall at a company level, currency was 0 help to us. But it helped on the margin, and certainly, the delta changed. That was the other 1/3 of the key drivers. I mean, when you think about why the volume was up in seeds in Brazil, I would say a couple of things: one, just the continued development of our new technologies that we continue to introduce, that farmers continue to get more and more comfortable that it does what it says. And it increases their yield, and so they just continue to get used to it. I do think there was some early buying in the quarter. I mean, the farmers, we don't get to choose to whether the farmers decide when they get the plant. And I do think there was some of that. That will be a Q3 versus a Q4 move. So I would not count all of that as a Q3 gain. But we feel good about where we ended up in the quarter."

It hasn't been a lot. Remember, 1,500 rigs were moved out of production, and you've got about 11 to 15 that have moved back in. But it is a move and it's starting in that direction. So there's cautious optimism there. I think as -- if prices continue to firm up on oil, they continue to firm up toward the $55, maybe even next year into the $60 range, you're going to see more rigs coming back in. So shale gas is going to be competitive. Some of these fields can be competitive at $25 a barrel. So I think we've got a situation, which is good for us, that the U.S. is competitive and it's going to be there longer. And so when you look at where our assets are around the world, we're in some very good competitive cost position bases to have our franchise. As far as supply-demand balances and the numbers that are in here, we're still running at the traditional 1.3, 1.4x GDP types of numbers for demand, and the real question mark is what's the GDP number that you plug into there. I would say at the beginning of the year, we were starting with something like a 3% global GDP, and we've backed off of that some through the year more towards a global 2.5% number. But look, we've had 6% growth all year, and we've oscillated between 6% and 10% in China year-over-year. We operated in kind of the 4% range in North America, similar, maybe a little bit stronger in Europe and kind of flat in Latin America. So our view going forward is these operating rates are strong. And it's not just reflective of the fact that you've got the historical rates. It's also sustainable packaging is driving a lot of trends toward plastics, and that's competing against other materials and we're knocking other materials out. So I think the sustainability trends are helping us stay there."

And so just like energy and just like security, food is right at the centerpiece of critical, basically making sure the constituencies are satisfied that they have adequate and safe food supply. So agricultural lobbies and farm lobbies are strong everywhere, and of course, create unlevel playing fields around the world. That's why there's some jurisdictions without GMOs and some with GMOs and there's some jurisdictions that have trade protection barriers and some that don't. So this is not a new conversation. Eyes wide open going to our transaction, as you all know, you in particular, about 10 years of asking the question, what are you going to do with Ag? We always felt that there was a complementarity between biology and chemistry and an integrated farm science helping the farmers. Integrated farm science, including Big Data, is expensive. And R&D to fuel that has to be funded in a public company over long cycles. In short-cycle investment hypothesis, not many people have patient money for long-cycle investment. The smart scale on innovation and procompetitiveness for farmers to get the very best out of their plot of land, whether it's an acre or 10,000 acres, row crops and niche crops and the science needed to get more food, safe, reliable food to all the citizens of those countries, it is the mission at hand with our deal. And frankly, I'm sure it's the mission I have with the other deals. We are first in, in all jurisdictions. We are very eyes wide open on what it means to create a procompetitive farm lobby, and we believe our deal does that. And if there are pushbacks based on various views on how those innovations come to market, we will definitely engage and are engaging. Again, we are taking the time to listen very carefully to what the jurisdictions want us to do. And we are very, very thoughtful on those remedies.

So I think the issue is where we're playing in automotive. When you look at the number of applications that we're in, whether it's our plastics products and gage, things like bumper fascia for the cars; our lightweighting solutions, like our crash-durable adhesives. So as companies continue to use carbon fiber, aluminum, other things, to bond to the steel frame, they need more adhesives in that vehicle. And when you get to it, we look at content per vehicle. So even though, in some areas, production in automotive year-over-year has flattened out, we're expanding our content per vehicle in that space, and I think that's what's driving the growth for us. Elastomers is a big product line that sells a lot into the automotive sector. Coatings as well into areas like sound dampening for the car, is an area that people sometimes don't appreciate how much content goes into the automotive space. So that's how we're growing better than market, is really getting the content per vehicle up and getting the number of solutions on the new vehicles up. And as you go into heavier vehicles, in trucks, you get into crossovers; and higher-performing vehicles, like the higher-performing sedan, the ones that people pay more value for, we have more content on those vehicles than, say, the entry-level sedan."

And this value creation of the deal in front of us, once we close the deal and implement the synergies and get going on the spins, we'll create even more value for our owners. So I really want to double down on the fact, this is a company that's delivering, and we will continue to do so."

The Dow team continues to deliver against every one of our goals for the year, building on our consistent track record of execution. 
Let's start with the financial highlight. We achieved record third quarter EBITDA and our highest third quarter EPS in a decade. This quarter marked 4 full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition, we returned more than $900 million of cash to our owners through stock buybacks and dividends. 
Operationally, we continue to meet consumer-led demand for Dow products and solution, driving volume gains in all geographies. We've now consistently grown volume over 3 years, 12 consecutive quarters, despite a slow-growth macro environment. 
We also delivered another quarter of productivity and cost savings, bringing the year-to-date contribution to $254 million, on track to exceed our 2016 target.
On our strategic projects, we accelerated the Dow Corning integration, moving quickly on our cost synergies, as we said we would. Our Sadara joint venture celebrated the startup of its multi-feed crackup and a third polyethylene train. And our next wave of U.S. Gulf Coast projects is on the cusp of delivering bottom line results. 
Dow's proven time and again the power and resilience of our business model, our focused market participation that shows resiliency in all environments, our commitment to self-help productivity and cost-cutting and the compelling upside from our strategic investments. Collectively, these drivers will deliver the next levels of earnings and cash flow growth and delivering that cash to our owners. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard to discuss our financial performance, the Dow Corning integration, modeling guidance and our Ag results. Jim will cover the remaining businesses. And I'll close with some thoughts on our track record of success and our future growth trajectory.

Turning to Slide 5. We had a number of important financial achievements in the quarter. We delivered operating EPS of $0.91, an 11% increase. We achieved record third quarter operating EBITDA of $2.5 billion, up $118 million, and we expanded our operating EBITDA margin to 20%. Our earnings expansion was driven by our consumer-oriented businesses, which features strong results with the integration of Dow Corning and better-than-expected performance in Dow Ag. We grew volume in every geographic area in the quarter, with notable strength in Europe, which was up 9%; and the United States and China, both up 6%. Productivity continued to be an important contributor. We delivered another $76 million of savings in the quarter. And finally, we resumed our share buyback program, with more than $400 million of share repurchases in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6 and an update on Dow Corning. Since close, we have been working quickly to integrate the Silicones platform into our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions businesses, as well as capturing the synergies. The quick wins we've already delivered underscore the power of the Silicones franchise, its highly complementary hand-in-glove fit with Dow's business model and the role this transaction plays in further enhancing our earnings growth profile.
First and foremost, the core business continues to outperform even our initial projections on broad-based volume gains and share growth. 
Second, I'm pleased to report that we've already reached more than $200 million in cost synergies on an annual run-rate basis. This was largely due to the value our team has extracted in purchasing, optimizing our warehouse and logistic footprints, as well as consolidating back-office operations.
We've also completed notifications with the vast majority of impacted roles, with only a small percentage remaining, where we're adhering to local labor rules. 
We remain on track to achieve a run rate of 70% against our $400 million cost synergy target by the first half of 2017 and 100% by the first half of '18. 
And finally, we're also seeing the power of Silicones on the growth side of the equation. As we've said for some time, Dow Corning Silicones is a natural fit into Dow's packaging, transportation, infrastructure and consumer care end markets. We are even more positive today about the growth synergy opportunities that this transaction presents. Our commercial and R&D teams finalized a playbook to achieve the $100 million growth synergy target, and in fact, we've already delivered some early cross-selling opportunities.
Bottom line, the Dow Corning integration is progressing very well, delivering financial returns, uncovering future growth opportunities and enhancing Dow's market-focused portfolio. 
Before we turn to our segment results, let me share some thoughts on modeling guidance on Slide 7.
In the fourth quarter, we expect Ag market headwinds to persist, largely offset by our self-help actions. Comparing year-over-year, recall that we sold several nonstrategic molecules last year, which lifted Ag results in that period. 
Consumer Solutions will benefit from the integration of Dow Corning. Approximately 60% of Dow Corning's EBITDA and synergies are in this segment. We do expect typical seasonality in Electronic Materials and U.S. auto production as we approach year end. 
In Infrastructure Solutions, my comments about Dow Corning apply here as well, with the other 40% of its EBITDA generated here. This segment also consumes roughly 1/3 of the propylene from our PDH unit. We expect that to be offset by continued oil and gas headwinds in Energy & Water.
Turning to Performance Materials & Chemicals, which consumes 2/3 of the propylene from our PDH unit. From a seasonality standpoint, we could see some upside from deicer sales. After all, it did snow yesterday in Michigan. As you know, we have seen compression on the integrated EO and PO margins globally, which will impact PMC. Also, Sadara costs are increasing here as we continue to start up downstream units related to this segment. 
Finally, in Performance Plastics, we expect a modest uptick from the cracker and the 3 PE units at Sadara, as sales have begun. However, we expect these to be more than offset by higher costs from the Louisiana turnaround, debottleneck and maintenance activities currently underway, as well as higher feedstock cost globally.
Now let's turn to our segments. I'll start first with Ag on Slide 9 and then hand it to Jim to cover the rest of the businesses. 
Dow Ag continues to outperform despite the ongoing challenging industry fundamentals. Segment EBITDA increased by $141 million and represents the best third quarter result in nearly a decade. Several factors contributed to our success: Share gains due to continued increasing demand for our innovative products, price improvements, continued self-help actions and strong early demand for the Latin America growing season.
Latin America seeds was the highlight. Strong demand in the region drove record sales, with price and volume both rising by double digits. Corn seed sales nearly tripled, primarily on double-digit volume and price growth in Latin America. The business increased share, particularly in the Brazilian safrina season, where we have a strong position. Soybean sales nearly tripled as well, reflecting higher price and volume. 
Crop Protection set a third quarter EBITDA record, supported by improved product mix and ongoing self-help productivity and cost-cutting actions. Insecticides improved on increased price, while herbicide pricing and fungicide volume each declined. 
I'll now turn it over to Jim to cover the rest of our segments."

This",662,"Thank you, Howard. Moving to Consumer Solutions on Slide 10. The segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record of $492 million, boosted by the integration of Dow Corning, which is further enhancing our end market positions across the segment. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth for this segment, and it demonstrates the power and differentiation of our consumer, automotive and Electronic Materials franchises. 
Dow Automotive achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth and a record third quarter EBITDA, led by double-digit volume gains in Asia Pacific on new business wins and market share gains. The business continues to grow above market on demand for Dow's light-weighting solution. 
Consumer Care grew market share through gains in homecare market sectors and new innovations for personal hygiene solutions. 
Silicones in the Consumer Solutions segment delivered double-digit volume growth in Asia Pacific behind demand for electronic and automotive applications. The business also achieved its first cross-selling opportunities with the Dow Automotive, Consumer Care and Polyurethanes businesses. 
And Dow Electronic Materials achieved record quarterly EBITDA. In addition to ongoing self-help measures, the business captured strong demand in semiconductor, interconnect and Display Technologies, particularly in Asia Pacific. 
On Slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions delivered EBITDA of $379 million, primarily reflecting the integration of Dow Corning. 
Dow Building & Construction achieved record third quarter EBITDA and delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth. The business captured volume gains on demands for acrylic-based construction chemicals and benefited from continued voluntary adoption of our BLUEDGE polymeric flame retardant. 
Silicones in the Infrastructure Solutions segment reported volume and EBITDA growth, driven by improved demand in packaging and building construction applications. 
Dow Coating Materials reported volume growth in all market segments, led by strong demand in Asia Pacific and gains in both the architectural and industrial coatings sectors.
Moving to Slide 12. Performance and Materials Chemicals EBITDA declined, primarily due to the impact of portfolio actions, which included divestitures and the reduced ownership in MEGlobal, as well as higher Sadara startup cost. In the core business, pricing pressures led to unit margin compression, but this was partly offset by volume growth. 
In Polyurethanes, we achieved record volume on double-digit gains in specialty polyols and systems houses, led by growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Industrial Solutions reported volume gains in all businesses, also led by strength in EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Turning to Performance Plastics on Slide 13. The team achieved $1.25 billion of EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, with gains across all businesses. A key part of our continued success is the team's focus on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment.
Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered record third quarter sales volume on double-digit growth in developed geographies and adoption of new innovations for food and specialty packaging applications. 
Dow Elastomers also achieved record third quarter volume, driven by increasing global consumer preference for larger vehicles that incorporate more Dow content, as well as double-digit growth in athletic footwear. These applications are further enhanced by our innovative products, such as INTUNE and INFUSE olefin block copolymers.
Dow Electrical and Telecommunications reported double-digit volume gains in the Americas, as the business continues to benefit from the global trends toward fiber optic cabling for faster and more reliable wireless connections.
Additionally, Sadara started up its multi-feed cracker in August and a third polyethylene train in September, adding to the 2 polyethylene trains already in operation. 
In the U.S. Gulf Coast, we commenced the Louisiana turnaround and feedstock flexibility project. That unit will restart later this quarter, giving our LA-3 cracker the ability to produce an additional 250,000 tons per year of ethylene and enhancing the reliability of one of the best units in our fleet.
During the quarter, our Texas-9 ethylene facility has 85% mechanical completion, and we made significant progress on our Performance Plastics production facilities. Our target for Texas-9 to come online remains mid-2017.
And now I'll hand it back over to Andrew."

And there's a chart here that you should pay particular attention to, the one on the right of the slide. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we've now achieved for 4 full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. And we've been doing earnings growth now for over a decade. You can see that we have taken a series of purposeful steps taken over these past many years. These steps are deeply rooted in our strategy to get to the near term right and the long term right and steadfast execution from an aligned Team Dow. 
And to put things into context, you actually have to go back to the late 1990s, when our industry came under pressure from state-owned enterprises. Returns were clearly impacted because we all had, Dow included, a me-too product wheel. Low-cost integration was absolutely necessary, but on its own, not enough to ensure long-term profitable growth. 
Since then, we've taken a number of decisive actions to create a sustainable business model, building on both low-cost integration and innovation to drive our narrower and deeper focus in attractive end markets; to invest for growth in consumer-led sectors while having a strong presence in investment-driven markets, like infrastructure; and to control what we can control through disciplined productivity and cost saving. In doing so, we believe we've created a portfolio for all seasons, a more resilient portfolio, one built to grow and last. 
We have fundamentally shifted our earnings trajectory, not only enhancing our growth, but also driving greater consistency. Equally important, we have put in place a series of growth drivers that will serve us well in the near and long term. These include: A reinvigorated, industry-leading R&D engine which now delivers over 5,000 new products every year; a new set of technical capabilities, most notably the addition of Dow Corning Silicones; an expanded footprint in attractive global markets through our investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Middle East and Asia, positioning us to grow where growth exists; and finally, a low-cost structure that has productivity wired into its very core. These drivers will further enhance our market focus, continue to reduce our volatility, bolster our integration and our innovation and ultimately maximize shareholder value creation.
Flipping to Slide 16. Of course, the ultimate proof of our business model is the enhanced returns Team Dow has delivered: Earnings growth, enhanced cash flow and higher shareholder returns. And going forward, our team remains relentlessly focused on our priorities: Delivering the operating and financial plan, accelerating earnings growth and value creation through the continued integration of Dow Corning and advancing through the DowDuPont transaction and intended wins. 
And we will do so despite persistent macro uncertainties. As I've said before, regional economic trends are mixed at best. North America and Europe show measured growth, with Dow products growing stronger than the market. Latin America, especially Brazil, which is beginning to recover, is a slow-growth environment. However, we do see bright spots there, particularly the Andean economies and Mexico. And economic transitions are underway in Asia, notably China. In this environment, we will continue to find growth where growth exists. That includes our core consumer-led markets of packaging, automotive and construction. 
As we establish the foundation for the new Dow, we have the right tools in hand to build the world's leading material science company. And our 4-year streak, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion fuels our excitement for the future. 
In closing, on Slide 17, we have not, nor will we, lose sight of our priorities. Dow will continue to deliver through our focused portfolio, our integration, our innovation and our geographic reach, through our relentless focus on our execution and on maximizing value creation for our customers, for our shareholders, for the near term and for the long term. 
With that, Neal, let's turn it to Q&A."

So the Louisiana 3 turnaround, the majority of that cost comes in this quarter. And we expect that unit to be up some time mid-November. That is not just a turnaround, but it's also tying in the ethylene -- the ethane cracking flexibility, which is both front-end on the furnaces and back-end on the distillation section and separation section of the plant. So that's a big turnaround. You still got Sadara startup costs for another polyethylene that comes -- train that comes up in first quarter. So those are neither one in last year. The other example I would give you is, when you look at this quarter and third quarter, if you look at the margin compression year-over-year, half of that is from Sadara startup costs and the beginning of the LA-3 turnaround. So I don't we're foretelling that there's a big margin compression coming here or there's big drop-off in demand. I think it's really more related to one-off items. We've also been doing turnarounds in our polyethylene derivatives space. So in Seadrift, where we're heavy on electrical and telecom capacity, we've been doing some turnarounds and debottlenecks and reliability work there. We're doing the similar types of things in St. Charles in our LP-6 plant.

PDH today is still running very positive cash margins, even in a low propylene environment, is running very positive cash margins. LA-3, the real EBITDA increment from LA-3 is the fact you get 250,000 tons a year more ethylene out of that. So that's right to our bottom line. That's produced for us versus purchased. So that goes to the bottom line. And Texas-9 and derivatives is a whole new slate of products. It's really 4 of our highest value-add derivatives plants on that franchise and it's our highest-growing segment.

There really hasn't been enough time to have enough of an impact from new capacity. As Sadara starts up, you've got to fill that supply chain to get the product out, so we've been moving a lot of product out into that supply chain. We sold some material, as was discussed earlier, in the third quarter in the month of September. However, you're going to see more of those sales come in the fourth quarter, as we got 3 units running and getting that supply chain full.

Thanks for noticing about the consistency in the increasing results. I appreciate it. Look, on the dividend and share repurchase, we've been on a streak here of a double-digit CAGR of growing our dividend for the last several years. Our payout ratio really hasn't changed. It's a 45% of net income target, long-term target that will go back to the shareholders in the form of dividend growth. And we've been tracking at that number. As the earnings have improved, net income has improved, we've improved the dividend. On stock buyback, the same. I mean, we've spent over $7 billion of cash in the last several years buying back stock. You saw that we entered the market again. Now that the shareholder vote was behind us on the DowDuPont transaction, we bought more than $400 million worth of stock back in the third quarter, with about $1.9 billion left in our open program. And so we're going to continue to do that as well."

But just on the big energy picture as it relates to China, in particular. I was just over there, as I indicated. I would tell you China is deindustrializing very fast, Hassan. I have no confidence that they're going to allocate capital to coal or emissions-heavy investments. I think there will be some of that, but these are massive capital investments that have the problem of not being forecastable in terms of returns, and that's the other pressure point. I believe certain enterprises, I've got this from literally the top leadership, are under huge pressure to show returns. And they are having, in essence, a come-to-jesus moment in terms of understanding how capital gets allocated between equity, property and other investments. It's much more western financial environment appearing there, especially as they open up the financial sector, which they pretty much are committing to do. I think that recalibration in China is going to slow down coal-heavy investments with time. The paradox there is I think they're going to much heavier into nuclear. I think that's going to be their place of choice while they transition to LNG. So I'm not confident at all that you're going to see CTO or MTO off of coal coming in anywhere near the pace that was foreshadowed. Jim, on the margin aspects of it?"

I mean, that $141 million improvement versus same quarter year ago, I'd break down the drivers into 3 buckets and it was pretty much equally split. About 1/3 was due to the higher volumes and higher prices, and specifically, seed in Brazil for sure. About 1/3 came from just the continued drumbeat, steady drumbeat now for many quarters in a row, on self-help productivity and cost-cutting. And then the other 1/3 was really by the turnaround in currency. If you think about a year ago, there were pretty big currency headwinds facing us in Ag. And it didn't help much. Actually in the quarter, I think it was 1 percentage point of the price up was related to currency in Ag. And actually overall at a company level, currency was 0 help to us. But it helped on the margin, and certainly, the delta changed. That was the other 1/3 of the key drivers. I mean, when you think about why the volume was up in seeds in Brazil, I would say a couple of things: one, just the continued development of our new technologies that we continue to introduce, that farmers continue to get more and more comfortable that it does what it says. And it increases their yield, and so they just continue to get used to it. I do think there was some early buying in the quarter. I mean, the farmers, we don't get to choose to whether the farmers decide when they get the plant. And I do think there was some of that. That will be a Q3 versus a Q4 move. So I would not count all of that as a Q3 gain. But we feel good about where we ended up in the quarter."

It hasn't been a lot. Remember, 1,500 rigs were moved out of production, and you've got about 11 to 15 that have moved back in. But it is a move and it's starting in that direction. So there's cautious optimism there. I think as -- if prices continue to firm up on oil, they continue to firm up toward the $55, maybe even next year into the $60 range, you're going to see more rigs coming back in. So shale gas is going to be competitive. Some of these fields can be competitive at $25 a barrel. So I think we've got a situation, which is good for us, that the U.S. is competitive and it's going to be there longer. And so when you look at where our assets are around the world, we're in some very good competitive cost position bases to have our franchise. As far as supply-demand balances and the numbers that are in here, we're still running at the traditional 1.3, 1.4x GDP types of numbers for demand, and the real question mark is what's the GDP number that you plug into there. I would say at the beginning of the year, we were starting with something like a 3% global GDP, and we've backed off of that some through the year more towards a global 2.5% number. But look, we've had 6% growth all year, and we've oscillated between 6% and 10% in China year-over-year. We operated in kind of the 4% range in North America, similar, maybe a little bit stronger in Europe and kind of flat in Latin America. So our view going forward is these operating rates are strong. And it's not just reflective of the fact that you've got the historical rates. It's also sustainable packaging is driving a lot of trends toward plastics, and that's competing against other materials and we're knocking other materials out. So I think the sustainability trends are helping us stay there."

I mean, as I mentioned many times already on this call, that food and agriculture are sine qua non discussions for countries and regions. And so just like energy and just like security, food is right at the centerpiece of political, basically making sure the constituencies are satisfied that they have adequate and safe food supply. So agricultural lobbies and farm lobbies are strong everywhere, and of course, create unlevel playing fields around the world. That's why there's some jurisdictions without GMOs and some with GMOs and there's some jurisdictions that have trade protection barriers and some that don't. So this is not a new conversation. Eyes wide open going into our transaction, as you all know, you in particular, about 10 years of asking the question, what are you going to do with Ag? We always felt that there was a complementarity between biology and chemistry and an integrated farm science helping the farmers. Integrated farm science, including Big Data, is expensive. And R&D to fuel that has to be funded in a public company over long cycles. In short-cycle investment hypothesis, not many people have patient money for long-cycle investment. The smart scale on innovation and procompetitiveness for farmers to get the very best out of their plot of land, whether it's an acre or 10,000 acres, row crops and niche crops and the science needed to get more food, safe, reliable food to all the citizens of those countries, it is the mission at hand with our deal. And frankly, I'm sure it's the mission I have with the other deals. We are first in, in all jurisdictions. We are very eyes wide open on what it means to create a procompetitive farm lobby, and we believe our deal does that. And if there are pushbacks based on various views on how those innovations come to market, we will definitely engage and are engaging. Again, we are taking the time to listen very carefully to what the jurisdictions want us to do. And we are very, very thoughtful on those remedies. And we are confident we'll close this deal in Q1, and frankly, solve that complex equation that you asked about, and hopefully, have articulated on."

So I think the issue is where we're playing in automotive. When you look at the number of applications that we're in, whether it's our plastics products and gage, things like bumper fascia for the cars; our lightweighting solutions, like our crash-durable adhesives. So as companies continue to use carbon fiber, aluminum, other things, to bond to the steel frame, they need more adhesives in that vehicle. And when you get to it, we look at content per vehicle. So even though, in some areas, production in automotive year-over-year has flattened out, we're expanding our content per vehicle in that space, and I think that's what's driving the growth for us. Elastomers is a big product line that sells a lot into the automotive sector. Coatings as well into areas like sound dampening for the car, is an area that people sometimes don't appreciate how much content goes into the automotive space. So that's how we're growing better than market, is really getting the content per vehicle up and getting the number of solutions on the new vehicles up. And as you go into heavier vehicles, in trucks, you get into crossovers; and higher-performing vehicles, like the higher-performing sedan, the ones that people pay more value for, we have more content on those vehicles than, say, the entry-level sedan."

I would tell you that, again, controlling what we can't control, self-help and productivity and an innovation agenda, speaks to that last question a bit, which is why we're growing volumes above market. 
We're growing where growth is needed, and we have built a portfolio, really, under all sorts of environments that can perform, a portfolio for all seasons. We're very focused here on running the business to its maximum EBITDA, EPS output. At the same time, we're very focused on closing the DowDuPont deal, and we're powered in those things. And I'm very proud of our team in that we've been able to do both. 
There's never been a better time at Dow. We're better positioned than ever before. We have a strong track record, multiple years now, of delivering. And we're delivering these results under these macros that, frankly, are not very helpful. But we have the portfolio and we've built the business. And you can expect us to return cash to our owners. That's our focus. 
And this value creation of the deal in front of us, once we close the deal and implement the synergies and get going on the spins, we'll create even more value for our owners. So I really want to double down on the fact, this is a company that's delivering, and we will continue to do so."

The Dow team continues to deliver against every one of our goals for the year, building on our consistent track record of execution. 
Let's start with the financial highlight. We achieved record third quarter EBITDA and our highest third quarter EPS in a decade. This quarter marked 4 full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition, we returned more than $900 million of cash to our owners through stock buybacks and dividends. 
Operationally, we continue to meet consumer-led demand for Dow products and solution, driving volume gains in all geographies. We've now consistently grown volume over 3 years, 12 consecutive quarters, despite a slow-growth macro environment. 
We also delivered another quarter of productivity and cost savings, bringing the year-to-date contribution to $254 million, on track to exceed our 2016 target.
On our strategic projects, we accelerated the Dow Corning integration, moving quickly on our cost synergies, as we said we would. Our Sadara joint venture celebrated the startup of its multi-feed crackup and a third polyethylene train. And our next wave of U.S. Gulf Coast projects is on the cusp of delivering bottom line results. 
Dow's proven time and again the power and resilience of our business model, our focused market participation that shows resiliency in all environments, our commitment to self-help productivity and cost-cutting and the compelling upside from our strategic investments. Collectively, these drivers will deliver the next levels of earnings and cash flow growth and delivering that cash to our owners. 
I'll now turn the call over to Howard to discuss our financial performance, the Dow Corning integration, modeling guidance and our Ag results. Jim will cover the remaining businesses. And I'll close with some thoughts on our track record of success and our future growth trajectory.

Turning to Slide 5. We had a number of important financial achievements in the quarter. We delivered operating EPS of $0.91, an 11% increase. We achieved record third quarter operating EBITDA of $2.5 billion, up $118 million, and we expanded our operating EBITDA margin to 20%. Our earnings expansion was driven by our consumer-oriented businesses, which features strong results with the integration of Dow Corning and better-than-expected performance in Dow Ag. We grew volume in every geographic area in the quarter, with notable strength in Europe, which was up 9%; and the United States and China, both up 6%. Productivity continued to be an important contributor. We delivered another $76 million of savings in the quarter. And finally, we resumed our share buyback program, with more than $400 million of share repurchases in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6 and an update on Dow Corning. Since close, we have been working quickly to integrate the Silicones platform into our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions businesses, as well as capturing the synergies. The quick wins we've already delivered underscore the power of the Silicones franchise, its highly complementary hand-in-glove fit with Dow's business model and the role this transaction plays in further enhancing our earnings growth profile.
First and foremost, the core business continues to outperform even our initial projections on broad-based volume gains and share growth. 
Second, I'm pleased to report that we've already reached more than $200 million in cost synergies on an annual run-rate basis. This was largely due to the value our team has extracted in purchasing, optimizing our warehouse and logistic footprints, as well as consolidating back-office operations.
We've also completed notifications with the vast majority of impacted roles, with only a small percentage remaining, where we're adhering to local labor rules. 
We remain on track to achieve a run rate of 70% against our $400 million cost synergy target by the first half of 2017 and 100% by the first half of '18. 
And finally, we're also seeing the power of Silicones on the growth side of the equation. As we've said for some time, Dow Corning Silicones is a natural fit into Dow's packaging, transportation, infrastructure and consumer care end markets. We are even more positive today about the growth synergy opportunities that this transaction presents. Our commercial and R&D teams finalized a playbook to achieve the $100 million growth synergy target, and in fact, we've already delivered some early cross-selling opportunities.
Bottom line, the Dow Corning integration is progressing very well, delivering financial returns, uncovering future growth opportunities and enhancing Dow's market-focused portfolio. 
Before we turn to our segment results, let me share some thoughts on modeling guidance on Slide 7.
In the fourth quarter, we expect Ag market headwinds to persist, largely offset by our self-help actions. Comparing year-over-year, recall that we sold several nonstrategic molecules last year, which lifted Ag results in that period. 
Consumer Solutions will benefit from the integration of Dow Corning. Approximately 60% of Dow Corning's EBITDA and synergies are in this segment. We do expect typical seasonality in Electronic Materials and U.S. auto production as we approach year end. 
In Infrastructure Solutions, my comments about Dow Corning apply here as well, with the other 40% of its EBITDA generated here. This segment also consumes roughly 1/3 of the propylene from our PDH unit. We expect that to be offset by continued oil and gas headwinds in Energy & Water.
Turning to Performance Materials & Chemicals, which consumes 2/3 of the propylene from our PDH unit. From a seasonality standpoint, we could see some upside from deicer sales. After all, it did snow yesterday in Michigan. As you know, we have seen compression on the integrated EO and PO margins globally, which will impact PMC. Also, Sadara costs are increasing here as we continue to start up downstream units related to this segment. 
Finally, in Performance Plastics, we expect a modest uptick from the cracker and the 3 PE units at Sadara, as sales have begun. However, we expect these to be more than offset by higher costs from the Louisiana turnaround, debottleneck and maintenance activities currently underway, as well as higher feedstock cost globally.
Now let's turn to our segments. I'll start first with Ag on Slide 9 and then hand it to Jim to cover the rest of the businesses. 
Dow Ag continues to outperform despite the ongoing challenging industry fundamentals. Segment EBITDA increased by $141 million and represents the best third quarter result in nearly a decade. Several factors contributed to our success: Share gains due to continued increasing demand for our innovative products, price improvements, continued self-help actions and strong early demand for the Latin America growing season.
Latin America seeds was the highlight. Strong demand in the region drove record sales, with price and volume both rising by double digits. Corn seed sales nearly tripled, primarily on double-digit volume and price growth in Latin America. The business increased share, particularly in the Brazilian safrina season, where we have a strong position. Soybean sales nearly tripled as well, reflecting higher price and volume. 
Crop Protection set a third quarter EBITDA record, supported by improved product mix and ongoing self-help productivity and cost-cutting actions. Insecticides improved on increased price, while herbicide pricing and fungicide volume each declined. 
I'll now turn it over to Jim to cover the rest of our segments."

This",662,"Thank you, Howard. Moving to Consumer Solutions on Slide 10. The segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record of $492 million, boosted by the integration of Dow Corning, which is further enhancing our end market positions across the segment. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth for this segment, and it demonstrates the power and differentiation of our consumer, automotive and Electronic Materials franchises. 
Dow Automotive achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth and a record third quarter EBITDA, led by double-digit volume gains in Asia Pacific on new business wins and market share gains. The business continues to grow above market on demand for Dow's light-weighting solution. 
Consumer Care grew market share through gains in homecare market sectors and new innovations for personal hygiene solutions. 
Silicones in the Consumer Solutions segment delivered double-digit volume growth in Asia Pacific behind demand for electronic and automotive applications. The business also achieved its first cross-selling opportunities with the Dow Automotive, Consumer Care and Polyurethanes businesses. 
And Dow Electronic Materials achieved record quarterly EBITDA. In addition to ongoing self-help measures, the business captured strong demand in semiconductor, interconnect and Display Technologies, particularly in Asia Pacific. 
On Slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions delivered EBITDA of $379 million, primarily reflecting the integration of Dow Corning. 
Dow Building & Construction achieved record third quarter EBITDA and delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth. The business captured volume gains on demands for acrylic-based construction chemicals and benefited from continued voluntary adoption of our BLUEDGE polymeric flame retardant. 
Silicones in the Infrastructure Solutions segment reported volume and EBITDA growth, driven by improved demand in packaging and building construction applications. 
Dow Coating Materials reported volume growth in all market segments, led by strong demand in Asia Pacific and gains in both the architectural and industrial coatings sectors.
Moving to Slide 12. Performance and Materials Chemicals EBITDA declined, primarily due to the impact of portfolio actions, which included divestitures and the reduced ownership in MEGlobal, as well as higher Sadara startup cost. In the core business, pricing pressures led to unit margin compression, but this was partly offset by volume growth. 
In Polyurethanes, we achieved record volume on double-digit gains in specialty polyols and systems houses, led by growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Industrial Solutions reported volume gains in all businesses, also led by strength in EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Turning to Performance Plastics on Slide 13. The team achieved $1.25 billion of EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, with gains across all businesses. A key part of our continued success is the team's focus on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment.
Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered record third quarter sales volume on double-digit growth in developed geographies and adoption of new innovations for food and specialty packaging applications. 
Dow Elastomers also achieved record third quarter volume, driven by increasing global consumer preference for larger vehicles that incorporate more Dow content, as well as double-digit growth in athletic footwear. These applications are further enhanced by our innovative products, such as INTUNE and INFUSE olefin block copolymers.
Dow Electrical and Telecommunications reported double-digit volume gains in the Americas, as the business continues to benefit from the global trends toward fiber optic cabling for faster and more reliable wireless connections.
Additionally, Sadara started up its multi-feed cracker in August and a third polyethylene train in September, adding to the 2 polyethylene trains already in operation. 
In the U.S. Gulf Coast, we commenced the Louisiana turnaround and feedstock flexibility project. That unit will restart later this quarter, giving our LA-3 cracker the ability to produce an additional 250,000 tons per year of ethylene and enhancing the reliability of one of the best units in our fleet.
During the quarter, our Texas-9 ethylene facility has 85% mechanical completion, and we made significant progress on our Performance Plastics production facilities. Our target for Texas-9 to come online remains mid-2017.
And now I'll hand it back over to Andrew."

And there's a chart here that you should pay particular attention to, the one on the right of the slide. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we've now achieved for 4 full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. And we've been doing earnings growth now for over a decade. You can see that we have taken a series of purposeful steps taken over these past many years. These steps are deeply rooted in our strategy to get to the near term right and the long term right and steadfast execution from an aligned Team Dow. 
And to put things into context, you actually have to go back to the late 1990s, when our industry came under pressure from state-owned enterprises. Returns were clearly impacted because we all had, Dow included, a me-too product wheel. Low-cost integration was absolutely necessary, but on its own, not enough to ensure long-term profitable growth. 
Since then, we've taken a number of decisive actions to create a sustainable business model, building on both low-cost integration and innovation to drive our narrower and deeper focus in attractive end markets; to invest for growth in consumer-led sectors while having a strong presence in investment-driven markets, like infrastructure; and to control what we can control through disciplined productivity and cost saving. In doing so, we believe we've created a portfolio for all seasons, a more resilient portfolio, one built to grow and last. 
We have fundamentally shifted our earnings trajectory, not only enhancing our growth, but also driving greater consistency. Equally important, we have put in place a series of growth drivers that will serve us well in the near and long term. These include: A reinvigorated, industry-leading R&D engine which now delivers over 5,000 new products every year; a new set of technical capabilities, most notably the addition of Dow Corning Silicones; an expanded footprint in attractive global markets through our investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Middle East and Asia, positioning us to grow where growth exists; and finally, a low-cost structure that has productivity wired into its very core. These drivers will further enhance our market focus, continue to reduce our volatility, bolster our integration and our innovation and ultimately maximize shareholder value creation.
Flipping to Slide 16. Of course, the ultimate proof of our business model is the enhanced returns Team Dow has delivered: Earnings growth, enhanced cash flow and higher shareholder returns. And going forward, our team remains relentlessly focused on our priorities: Delivering the operating and financial plan, accelerating earnings growth and value creation through the continued integration of Dow Corning and advancing through the DowDuPont transaction and intended wins. 
And we will do so despite persistent macro uncertainties. As I've said before, regional economic trends are mixed at best. North America and Europe show measured growth, with Dow products growing stronger than the market. Latin America, especially Brazil, which is beginning to recover, is a slow-growth environment. However, we do see bright spots there, particularly the Andean economies and Mexico. And economic transitions are underway in Asia, notably China. In this environment, we will continue to find growth where growth exists. That includes our core consumer-led markets of packaging, automotive and construction. 
As we establish the foundation for the new Dow, we have the right tools in hand to build the world's leading material science company. And our 4-year streak, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion fuels our excitement for the future. 
In closing, on Slide 17, we have not, nor will we, lose sight of our priorities. Dow will continue to deliver through our focused portfolio, our integration, our innovation and our geographic reach, through our relentless focus on our execution and on maximizing value creation for our customers, for our shareholders, for the near term and for the long term. 
With that, Neal, let's turn it to Q&A."

Our view is that propane is still long, and propane is Dow's big advantage in feedstock flexibility. Propane is still long for some time to come.

So the Louisiana 3 turnaround, the majority of that cost comes in this quarter. And we expect that unit to be up some time mid-November. That is not just a turnaround, but it's also tying in the ethylene -- the ethane cracking flexibility, which is both front-end on the furnaces and back-end on the distillation section and separation section of the plant. So that's a big turnaround. You still got Sadara startup costs for another polyethylene that comes -- train that comes up in first quarter. So those are neither one in last year. The other example I would give you is, when you look at this quarter and third quarter, if you look at the margin compression year-over-year, half of that is from Sadara startup costs and the beginning of the LA-3 turnaround. So I don't we're foretelling that there's a big margin compression coming here or there's big drop-off in demand. I think it's really more related to one-off items. We've also been doing turnarounds in our polyethylene derivatives space. So in Seadrift, where we're heavy on electrical and telecom capacity, we've been doing some turnarounds and debottlenecks and reliability work there. We're doing the similar types of things in St. Charles in our LP-6 plant.

PDH today is still running very positive cash margins, even in a low propylene environment, is running very positive cash margins. LA-3, the real EBITDA increment from LA-3 is the fact you get 250,000 tons a year more ethylene out of that. So that's right to our bottom line. That's produced for us versus purchased. So that goes to the bottom line. And Texas-9 and derivatives is a whole new slate of products. It's really 4 of our highest value-add derivatives plants on that franchise and it's our highest-growing segment.

And then I would say the rest of it is the latter part. The mix shift and the value-add from the mix shift is the big thing. There really hasn't been enough time to have enough of an impact from new capacity. As Sadara starts up, you've got to fill that supply chain to get the product out, so we've been moving a lot of product out into that supply chain. We sold some material, as was discussed earlier, in the third quarter in the month of September. However, you're going to see more of those sales come in the fourth quarter, as we got 3 units running and getting that supply chain full.

I have no confidence that they're going to allocate capital to coal or emissions-heavy investments. I think there will be some of that, but these are massive capital investments that have the problem of not being forecastable in terms of returns, and that's the other pressure point. I believe certain enterprises, I've got this from literally the top leadership, are under huge pressure to show returns. And they are having, in essence, a come-to-Jesus moment in terms of understanding how capital gets allocated between equity, property and other investments. It's much more western financial environment appearing there, especially as they open up the financial sector, which they pretty much are committing to do. I think that recalibration in China is going to slow down coal-heavy investments with time. The paradox there is I think they're going to much heavier into nuclear. I think that's going to be their place of choice while they transition to LNG. So I'm not confident at all that you're going to see CTO or MTO off of coal coming in anywhere near the pace that was foreshadowed. Jim, on the margin aspects of it?"

I mean, that $141 million improvement versus same quarter year ago, I'd break down the drivers into 3 buckets and it was pretty much equally split. About 1/3 was due to the higher volumes and higher prices, and specifically, seed in Brazil for sure. About 1/3 came from just the continued drumbeat, steady drumbeat now for many quarters in a row, on self-help productivity and cost-cutting. And then the other 1/3 was really by the turnaround in currency. If you think about a year ago, there were pretty big currency headwinds facing us in Ag. And it didn't help much. Actually in the quarter, I think it was 1 percentage point of the price up was related to currency in Ag. And actually overall at a company level, currency was 0 help to us. But it helped on the margin, and certainly, the delta changed. That was the other 1/3 of the key drivers. I mean, when you think about why the volume was up in seeds in Brazil, I would say a couple of things: one, just the continued development of our new technologies that we continue to introduce, that farmers continue to get more and more comfortable that it does what it says. And it increases their yield, and so they just continue to get used to it. I do think there was some early buying in the quarter. I mean, the farmers, we don't get to choose to whether the farmers decide when they get the plant. And I do think there was some of that. That will be a Q3 versus a Q4 move. So I would not count all of that as a Q3 gain. But we feel good about where we ended up in the quarter."

It hasn't been a lot. Remember, 1,500 rigs were moved out of production, and you've got about 11 to 15 that have moved back in. But it is a move and it's starting in that direction. So there's cautious optimism there. I think as -- if prices continue to firm up on oil, they continue to firm up toward the $55, maybe even next year into the $60 range, you're going to see more rigs coming back in. So shale gas is going to be competitive. Some of these fields can be competitive at $25 a barrel. So I think we've got a situation, which is good for us, that the U.S. is competitive and it's going to be there longer. And so when you look at where our assets are around the world, we're in some very good competitive cost position bases to have our franchise. As far as supply-demand balances and the numbers that are in here, we're still running at the traditional 1.3, 1.4x GDP types of numbers for demand, and the real question mark is what's the GDP number that you plug into there. I would say at the beginning of the year, we were starting with something like a 3% global GDP, and we've backed off of that some through the year more towards a global 2.5% number. But look, we've had 6% growth all year, and we've oscillated between 6% and 10% in China year-over-year. We operated in kind of the 4% range in North America, similar, maybe a little bit stronger in Europe and kind of flat in Latin America. So our view going forward is these operating rates are strong. And it's not just reflective of the fact that you've got the historical rates. It's also sustainable packaging is driving a lot of trends toward plastics, and that's competing against other materials and we're knocking other materials out. So I think the sustainability trends are helping us stay there."

I mean, as I mentioned many times already on this call, that food and agriculture are sine qua non discussions for countries and regions. And so just like energy and just like security, food is right at the centerpiece of political, basically making sure the constituencies are satisfied that they have adequate and safe food supply. So agricultural lobbies and farm lobbies are strong everywhere, and of course, create unlevel playing fields around the world. That's why there's some jurisdictions without GMOs and some with GMOs and there's some jurisdictions that have trade protection barriers and some that don't. So this is not a new conversation. Eyes wide open going into our transaction, as you all know, you in particular, about 10 years of asking the question, what are you going to do with Ag? We always felt that there was a complementarity between biology and chemistry and an integrated farm science helping the farmers. Integrated farm science, including Big Data, is expensive. And R&D to fuel that has to be funded in a public company over long cycles. In short-cycle investment hypothesis, not many people have patient money for long-cycle investment. The smart scale on innovation and procompetitiveness for farmers to get the very best out of their plot of land, whether it's an acre or 10,000 acres, row crops and niche crops and the science needed to get more food, safe, reliable food to all the citizens of those countries, it is the mission at hand with our deal. And frankly, I'm sure it's the mission I have with the other deals. We are first in, in all jurisdictions. We are very eyes wide open on what it means to create a procompetitive farm lobby, and we believe our deal does that. And if there are pushbacks based on various views on how those innovations come to market, we will definitely engage and are engaging. Again, we are taking the time to listen very carefully to what the jurisdictions want us to do. And we are very, very thoughtful on those remedies. And we are confident we'll close this deal in Q1, and frankly, solve that complex equation that you asked about, and hopefully, have articulated on."

When you look at the number of applications that we're in, whether it's our plastics products and gage, things like bumper fascia for the cars; our lightweighting solutions, like our crash-durable adhesives. So as companies continue to use carbon fiber, aluminum, other things, to bond to the steel frame, they need more adhesives in that vehicle. And when you get to it, we look at content per vehicle. So even though, in some areas, production in automotive year-over-year has flattened out, we're expanding our content per vehicle in that space, and I think that's what's driving the growth for us. Elastomers is a big product line that sells a lot into the automotive sector. Coatings as well into areas like sound dampening for the car, is an area that people sometimes don't appreciate how much content goes into the automotive space. So that's how we're growing better than market, is really getting the content per vehicle up and getting the number of solutions on the new vehicles up. And as you go into heavier vehicles, in trucks, you get into crossovers; and higher-performing vehicles, like the higher-performing sedan, the ones that people pay more value for, we have more content on those vehicles than, say, the entry-level sedan."
