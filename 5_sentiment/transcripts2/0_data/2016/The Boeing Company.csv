I'm going to begin by discussing our solid 2015 operating performance then provide an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail. 
As most of you know, 2016 is a milestone year for Boeing, marking our 100th year in business. Over the past century, successive generations of exceptionally talented and dedicated Boeing employees have passed the porch of ingenuity and innovation to help build the world's largest aerospace company and shape the course of human history over along the way. It's our privilege and responsibility in the years ahead to preserve and extend this incredible legacy, and we intend as we did in 2015, to take Boeing to even greater heights in the second century of aerospace leadership. 
In 2015, we continued to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company. We reported record revenue, solid quarter earnings per share and strong cash flow. We continued to make strategic investments in our people, products and services to strengthen and grow our Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space and Security business. And throughout the year, we demonstrated our commitment, provide increasing returns and significant cash to our shareholders.
For the full year, we repurchased 47 million shares to $6.75 billion, and paid $2.5 billion in dividends. In December, our Board of Directors approved a new $14 billion share repurchase authorization and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This disciplined and balanced cash deployment strategy reflects continued confidence in our large and diverse backlog, our strong product portfolio and an overall outlook in the global aerospace and defense industry. 
Now turning to our core operating performance for the year. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $66 billion, thanks in large part to an industry record 762 deliveries last year, which extended our market share leadership in airplane deliveries to the fourth consecutive year. 
Airplane order activity was healthy as we captured 768 net orders. This further supported our robust backlog of nearly 5,800 airplanes or about 7 years of production in[indiscernible]. 
Other key milestones included the goal out of the first 737 MAX, achieving 90% engineering design on the 787-10 and foreign configuration in the 777X. We also began initial introduction of new automation technology on 777 production line. This technology will be matured on the current line before being transitioned over to the 777X. 
A noteworthy milestone for industry and others and for large and small U.S. exporters alike, was the 5-year extension of the U.S. export-import bank. This reauthorization of the bank restores competitive balance in international trade and enables American exporters to compete on a level playing field in tough global markets. 
These developments and some helped to further derisk our business going forward. We expect a tentative labor agreement to reach earlier this month between the Boeing and Peugeot Sound base engineering[indiscernible] will have the same effect with the best light market-leading development programs underwriting our customers, this agreement will provide 6 years of labor stability while recognizing our engineering and technical workforce for their important contributions to our ongoing success.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security had a very strong year with solid revenue, healthy margins and progress in critical program milestones. 2015 milestones included the first KC-46 tanker and its first international sale to Japan, the first EA-18G delivery to the Australian airforce, the fourth and final AEW&C delivery to Turkey with selection of 747-8 to replace the current U.S. presidential aircraft and the completed demonstration on the Commercial Crew program. 
2016 is off to  a strong start as well with the KC-46  tanker successfully transferring fuel in flight to an F-16 in just the past few days a very important accomplishment of that is an essential step in a bringing milestones and begins our milestone testing that will lead to a low rate initial production decision this spring.
Despite the challenging environment over the last several years, our team continues to adapt to the shifting dynamics while maintaining a strong performance and investing to be ready for an eventual upturn in the market. 
In summary, our Boeing team produced another strong year of operating performance and cash generation, and we made further strides in derisking our business, all of which positions as well and increases our momentum for 2016 and beyond.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3.
We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace, driven by improving airline profitability, solid passenger traffic growth and meaningful replacement. Traffic data for 2015 illustrates the strength of the passenger market with a global passenger traffic increasing 7% for the year, which was above the 10-year average. In contrast, as we highlighted in our rate reduction announcement last week on the 747-8, the global cargo market recover with the airfreight traffic growing a modest 2% during the year. We remain confident in the long-term recovery in the cargo market and in the upcoming replacement cycle where we see approximately 240 large freighters that will be over 20 years old by 2019.
While overall airplane demand remains healthy, as always we will continue to keep a watchful eye on the evolving market conditions to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. According to, the airline industry is expected to have another record year in 2016 as earnings are projected to rise 10% to $36 billion fueled by lower oil prices, strong passenger demand and airline efficiencies
Additionally, passenger traffic in 2016 is forecast to grow 7% and cargo is forecast to increase 3% In addition, global GDP is forecast to increase 2.7% in 2016, a healthy level for our industry.
We also continue to see strong growth in Chinese airline traffic. In 2015, passenger traffic in China increased 15% compared to GDP growth of 7%,
a steady trend we have seen for the past 5 years. Based on today's Chinese passenger travel, we see the market is currently underserved by approximately 1,000 aircraft. With the middle class population forecast to grow 10% annually through 2025, the market opportunity is significant. Over the next 20 years, we see the Chinese market needing over 6,300 new aircraft.
Specifically related to oil, notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one, and we have seen airlines in the past efficiently adjust to similar market conditions in periods such as today with higher passenger demand and lower oil prices, airlines deploy new aircraft more for growth rather than replace older assets. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. This ongoing demand, coupled with our sizable backlog of nearly 5,800 aircraft, which is balanced geographically and across customer operating models reinforces our planned production rate increases and position us for significant revenue, earnings and cash growth in years ahead.
The rapid return on investment of new more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel environment that is well below the 15-year average, as evidenced by the purchase decisions announced just last week by Southwest and United Airlines. As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically advanced aircraft also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increase residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range at growth of market opportunities by allowing and more optimal routes
.All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft
We're also seeing further strength in aircraft financing market as financiers continue to see commercial aircraft as a good investment. As I alluded to earlier, the order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. For 2016, we anticipate a year of healthy order activity and are targeting a book-to-bill of approximately 1, supporting our view with the fact that the request and cancellations also remain well below the historical average. Overall, our commercial airplane outlook remains positive as we expect the combination of growth and replacements to drive the need for 38,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.
Turning to individual PCA programs given the 737s robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm [ph] orders and continued healthy global demand, we have decided to move ahead with an additional production rate increase in 2019 to 57 aircraft per month.
As we announced previously, we plan to raise production from 42 a month now to 47 in 2017 followed by 52 a month in 2018. We've long maintained a disciplined and conservative approach in assessing future production rate increases and our confidence in ongoing market financial fuel and operating efficiency advantages of the 737 is very high.
Demand also remains strong for the 777X with a backlog of 306 aircraft from 6 customers. 
On the 777, we captured 101 orders over the last 2 years and, earlier this month, we booked orders for another 6 from Air China, putting us off to a good start in 2016. Our 777 backlog stands at 224 aircraft. 
Regarding the transition to the 777X, we indicated last year that we did not anticipate the production rate on the program going below 7 per month. In solidifying our production plan over the past few months, we can confirm that view with the time line for shifting to a 777 production rate of 7 per month starting in 2017 to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X. 
In terms of production slots, we are sold out on the 777 in 2016. At the 7 per month rate in 2017, we are approximately 80% sold out and feel good about customer demand until the remaining slots given the airplane's unique and recognized value proposition. 
Furthermore, for 2018, we currently are in a healthy position in the balance of current and sold slots. On the 787 program, we captured 71 net orders for the year, which further shows a healthy market demand for this compelling wide-body airplane. The 787's backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered 366 787s to date, including more than 70 -9s. 
The top and bottom line outlook for our commercial airplane business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, with planned rate increases on 737, 787 and 767 smoothly transitions 737 productions to the MAX and deliver on our development programs such as the 777X and 787-10. 
Now turning to Defense, space and security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. The enacted fiscal year 2016 budget contains increases over 2015 for many of our core programs, including the P-8 Poseidon, the KC-46 A Tanker, Apache[indiscernible] helicopters, missile defense, commercial crew and space launch system. The budget also added 12 F-18 aircraft. The bipartisan budget agreement provides a framework for these results and also bring greater stability through fiscal year 2017 congressional budget process. 
International demand for remains healthy. In particular, related to commercial craft, fighters, satellites and services. During the fourth quarter, international customers for defense space and security represented 33% of our revenue and 40% of our current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that have already [indiscernible] our customers, such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Furthermore, we remain focused on investing in BDS future franchise program, which represents critical capabilities for our customers and substantial business opportunities. While we await the outcome of the long range strike evaluation, we continue to leverage the capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, capitalization, new class and other important opportunities while we are driving new levels of capability and affordability for our customers. 
In summary, our strategies are aligned and it opportunities of our markets and our teams are focused on delivering solid operating performance. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our 2016 guidance."
370857,319736456,921651,"The Boeing Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thanks, Dennis, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4, will discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $96 billion, reflecting a 6% increase from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane busines",1713,"Thanks, Dennis, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4, will discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $96 billion, reflecting a 6% increase from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. 
Core earnings per share totaled $7.72 for the full year, reflecting strong operating performance across the company that is offset by the  $1.61 for the second quarter KC-46  tanker charge and the fourth quarter 747 program charge. 
Operating cash flow for the year was also strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries and solid core operating performance. 
Moving now to our quarterly results on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.6 billion driven largely by solid commercial delivery and healthy defense revenues. Core operating margins were 5.3%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses, which were offset by the previously announced $885 million pretax charge on the 747 program. The charge reflects the slow recovery in the cargo market that required us to account for the market impact and lower production rates going forward. 
Fourth quarter core earnings per share was $1.60 on solid core operating performance but again offset by the 747 charge. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane revenue decreased slightly to $16 1 billion due to timing of airplane deliveries. Commercial Airplane operating margins were largely impacted by the 747 charge, higher planned research and development spending and the timing of airplane deliveries, all of which was partially offset by continued solid core operating performance and timing of period costs in the quarter. 
For the full year, Commercial Airplanes revenue was a record $66 billion, an increase of 10% as we successfully executed on our backlog. Commercial airplanes captured $21 billion of net order during the quarter to a backlog now of stand of $432 billion and nearly 5,800 aircraft. For the full year, we captured $57 billion on 768 net orders. 
Specifically on 787, the team delivered a record 135 787s and ramped up production on 787-9. We've now delivered 74 787-9 aircraft and as planned 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-9 deliveries in 2016.
We also continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we implement additional production efficiencies.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost approximately 40% over the last 240 deliveries. And furthermore, 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 30% since the first delivery. Consistent with our expectations, 787 program also became cash positive in the fourth quarter.
787 deferred production increased $201 million to $28.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing unit cost reductions.
We expect about the same level of deferred growth in the first quarter. For the full year, the deferred balance production balance is forecasted to be flat year-over-year. 
Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to anticipate the full production decline shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change in this fundamental milestone. 
We remain on track to achieve the 12 per month 787 delivery rate in mid-'16 with supplier already operating at that production level. We still have a work ahead of us under the 787s, as we remain focused on execution and risk reduction while improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward, and the team remains focused on these priorities. 
Turning now to defense, space and security results on Slide 7.
Fourth quarter revenue, our defense business increased 3% to $7.8 billion and operating margins increased to a record 12.4% due to strong performance across the portfolio.
Revenue at Boeing military aircraft increased 7% to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter resulting from higher volume and delivery mix. operating margins were 13.7% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance and the benefit of higher volumes and mix. 
Network and space systems revenue declined to $2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower satellite volume and N&SS generated operating margins of 8.3%.
Global Services and support recorded a 9% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.6 billion on an AEW&C delivery and higher aircraft modernization and sustained volume. GS&S generated strong operating margin of 13.8% driven by sale of the contract mix and performance.
Defense, space and security reported $7 billion in new business in the quarter and the backlog stands at $58 billion, of which 40% represents customers from outside the United States.
Turning now to Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $3.1 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by solid operating performance across both businesses.
Again, operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance and our continued efforts to drive disciplined cash management.
With regard to capital deployment, we paid $608 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 5 million shares for $750 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2015 repurchase activity to 47 million shares for $6.75 billion.
As Dennis mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion and an increase to our dividend of another 20%. That's up 125% in 3 years. And over the same period, we have lowered our share count by approximately 10% through the repurchase of nearly 120 million shares.
We expect to complete the $14 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our capital deployment strategy demonstrates the strength of our backlog and the confidence in our business going forward. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us. 
Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with 12.$1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide strong liquidity and positions as well going forward
This financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key areas of our business, return cash to shareholders and again execute on our cash deployment strategies going forward.
Turning now to Slide 10, we'll discuss our outlook for 2016.
Our outlook for 2016 reflects solid core operating performance while reflecting the near-term investment to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Revenue for 2016 is forecast to be between $93 billion and $95 billion, reflecting the planned transition to the 737 MAX, lower F-18 and C-17 volume and reduced 747 production and timing of deliveries. We continue to see revenue growth over the remainder of the decade with 7 more commercial production rate increases planned as we deliver on a robust backlog. 
Core earnings per share guidance for 2016 is set to be between $8.15 and $8.35 per share. Our 2016 commercial airplane revenue guidance is set to be between $64 billion and $65 billion.
The 2016 commercial delivery guidance is between 740 and 745 airplanes. This reflects the decrease in 747 deliveries driven by the market and resulting production rate decision we talked about earlier. It also reflects the 737 transition to the MAX as we continue to build fast airplanes and produce units for 2017 delivery upon certification. And we also see lower 767 deliveries as we ramp-up on the tanker program again in preparation for 2017 certification and delivery. 
We expect commercial airplane deliveries to increase in 2017 as we deliver on our planned production rate increases.  
Specifically related to 787 deliveries, as I mentioned earlier, we are currently on plan to increase the production rate to 12 per month by mid-'16. However, 787 deliveries for 2016 will be in line with 2015 levels due to timing of customer deliveries
Commercial Airplanes operating margin guidance is approximately  % on improved operating performance offset by the dilutive impact of higher planned research and development spending, lower volume on 737 MAX transition and higher 787 revenue, combined with further investment that support future business growth.
Defense, space and security revenue guidance for 2016 is between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion, reflecting continued challenging defense DoD environment. And going forward, we expect tanker revenue to increase as we enter into full rate production. We also see long-term growth driven by PA, services, international craft and space, along with the potential future franchise programs that Dennis mentioned earlier. 
Operating margin guidance for our defense business is set to be greater than 10%, reflecting continued productivity offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix.
Supporting our strategic portfolio announcements, we expect research and development spending for 2016 to be approximately $3.6 billion with about 75% related to PCA primarily driven by the planned increases in 777 development while BDS will continue to invest in key strategic opportunities.
We expect operating cash flow for 2016 to be approximately $10 billion, reflecting healthy deliveries, strong operating performance and continued 787 productivity. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and timing of international 2 17 receipts that affected 2015 cash flow.
Capital spending guidance for 2016 is set to be approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the new 777X facilities and equipments, expansion of our Boeing South Carolina to support 787 rate increases and continued investment to support of future growth and productivity. 
Consistent with our prior years and given the seasonality of our business as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year. Core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full year earnings and Q1 cash flow is forecast to be at near breakeven, again driven by timing of receipts and expenditures.
The drivers behind our long-term year-over-year cash growth story are unchanged. We continue to expect strong core operating performance, improved 787 productivity, working capital efficiencies and increasing production over the remainder of the decade. While we remain watchful of the current market condition, healthy passenger traffic, continued aircraft replacement demand and the compelling value proposition our aircraft provides confidence in our backlog
This is combined with the continued progress in derisking our business and accelerating productivity efforts. We will continue the long-term growth and increase value to all of our stakeholders
Now I'll turn it over back to Dennis for some final thoughts"

We also continue to convert our robust backlog into cash, and we met our promises by returning more than $9 billion to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
Furthermore, we invested in our people and innovation to maintain and grow our competitive advantage while also continuing to build out capacity to support future production rate increases.
Collectively, our actions strengthen our position as the world's leading aerospace company and provides tremendous momentum for 2016 and beyond.
Our clarity going forward could be framed by 2 overarching objectives: First, to continue building strength, to deliver on our existing plan and commitments and improve them where needed; and second, to stretch ourselves beyond those plans and accelerate our pace of progress in key enterprise growth and productivity efforts to achieve our full potential. Achieving both objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, delivering on our development programs, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, driving world-class productivity and performance through the end or price to fund our investments and innovation of growth and to maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which is aimed to position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top- and bottom-line growth and to create ever increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders

Some of the things I'll say kind of headwinds into going into '16 offsetting some of that is certainly higher cash tax payments as we improve our unit cost and performance on the 787, so we'll have some of that headwind in this year.

And then just continuing to build inventory obviously on the tanker as we get ready to deliver that in 2017. Dennis indicated we had a very successful milestone there recently, so that's going well. And, then of course, you've got the MAX transition going on. So those are some of the big moving pieces. And at the same time, the long-term kind of view on cash flow remains unchanged, Howard.

If you take a look at this year, compared to 2015, as you well noted, our delivery guidance is down about 20 aircraft. The majority of that is the 737 because of the MAX transition as we've always planned. So we will be building another 2 test aircraft this year. And then we are also building ahead on MAXs that will be ultimately delivered in 2017. But there's about a dozen aircraft in there that are in 737 and related to the MAX transition as planned. That's why you see delivery down a bit this year. There's also a bit of a pullback because of the announced reduction in 747 fleet. Those are the principal drivers in terms of number of aircrafts. Now to your point, it's really important that we look at this from a long-term view. So while we go through a transition in 2016, if you look at the sudden rate ramp-up ahead of us and look out in the next several years, you'll see that revenue will grow, you'll see that deliveries will grow as we execute on the backlog. And so just stepping back from a year of transition and looking out to 2017, 2018, you'll see revenue growth, you'll see earnings growth, you'll see cash flow. We remain very confident in that story. And that's backed up by the committed rate ramp-up that we have in the plan and we'll continue to consistently execute. So it's very important to note that this year, you'll see transition because of the MAX, a temporary reduction in revenue top line as a result, but we can tell you very clearly that our long-term view here is increasing top and bottom line performance and cash growth year-over-year.

But I think when you're thinking about MAX coming into production system, if you think about how smoothly the -9 has come into 787-8 line, that methodology and that process, the process apply there is the exact same one being applied here to ensure that we have smooth transition and we meet those rate increases and the commitment we made to our customers. So near term transition but absolutely the right thing to do for the long term.

Airplane passenger traffic growth increased 15%. So passenger growth continues to outpace GDP. That is a strong trend, it's a long-term trend, and that's part of what paints a bit more of a bullish view in terms of our growth prospects. You see that reflected in our planned production rate increases. And again, we try to be very disciplined about that. We take a long-term view on these rate increase decisions, and those are not made lightly. And we take that balanced view and the fact that we are ramping up should convey our general confidence in the marketplace and we'll continue to keep a watchful eye on the macroeconomics."

I'm going to begin by discussing our solid 2015 operating performance, then provide an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail. 
As most of you know, 2016 is a milestone year for Boeing, marking our 100th year in business. Over the past century, successive generations of exceptionally talented and dedicated Boeing employees have passed the torch of ingenuity and innovation to help build the world's largest aerospace company and shape the course of human history along the way. It's our privilege and responsibility in the years ahead to preserve and extend this incredible legacy, and we intend as we did in 2015, to take Boeing to even greater heights in the second century of aerospace leadership. 
In 2015, we continue to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company. We reported record revenue, solid core earnings per share and strong cash flow. We continued to make strategic investments in our people, products and services to strengthen and grow our Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security businesses. And throughout the year, we demonstrated our commitment to provide increasing returns and significant cash to our shareholders.
For the full year, we repurchased 47 million shares for $6.75 billion, and paid $2.5 billion in dividends. In December, our Board of Directors approved a new $14 billion share repurchase authorization and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This disciplined and balanced cash deployment strategy reflects continued confidence in our large and diverse backlog, our strong product portfolio and an overall healthy outlook in the global aerospace and defense industry. 
Now turning to our core operating performance for the year. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $66 billion, thanks in large part to an industry record 762 deliveries last year, which extended our market share leadership in airplane deliveries to the fourth consecutive year. 
Airplane order activity was healthy as we captured 768 net orders. This further supported our robust backlog of nearly 5,800 airplanes or about 7 years of production at current rates. 
Other key milestones included the rollout of the first 737 MAX, achieving 90% engineering design release on the 787-10 and foreign configuration in the 777X. We also began initial introduction of new automation technology on 777 production line. This technology will be matured on the current line before being transitioned over to the 777X. 
A noteworthy milestone for industry and others, and for large and small U.S. exporters alike, was the 5-year extension of the U.S. export-import bank. This reauthorization of the bank restores competitive balance in international trade and enables American exporters to compete on a level playing field in tough global markets. 
These developments and some helped to further derisk our business going forward. We expect a tentative labor agreement to reach earlier this month between the Boeing and our Puget Sound-based engineering meaning will have the same effect with a slight market-leading development programs underwrite for our customers, this agreement will provide 6 years of labor stability while recognizing and rewarding our engineering and technical workforce for their important contributions to our ongoing success.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security had a very strong year with solid revenue, healthy margins and progress in critical program milestones. 2015 milestones include the first flight of the KC-46A tanker and its first international sale to Japan. The first EA-18G delivery to the Australian Air Force, and fourth and final AEW&C delivery to Turkey. The selection of the 747-8 to replace the current U.S. presidential aircraft, and we completed flight software demonstration on the Commercial Crew program. 
2016 is off to a strong start as well with the KC-46  tanker successfully transferring fuel in flight to an F-16 in just the past few days, a very important accomplishment that is an essential step forward in bringing milestones and begins our milestone C testing that will lead to a low rate initial production decision this spring.
Despite the challenging Defense environment over the last several years, our team continues to adapt to the shifting dynamics while maintaining a strong performance and investing to be ready for an eventual upturn in the market. 
In summary, our Boeing team produced another strong year of operating performance and cash generation, and we made further strides in derisking our business, all of which positions us well and increases our momentum for 2016 and beyond.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3.
We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace, driven by improving airline profitability, solid passenger traffic growth and meaningful replacement. Traffic data for 2015 illustrates the strength of the passenger market, with global passenger traffic increasing 7% for the year, which was above the 10-year average. In contrast, as we highlighted in our rate reduction announcement last week on the 747-8, the global cargo market recovery stalled during 2015 with the airfreight traffic growing a modest 2% during the year. We remain confident in the long-term recovery in the cargo market and the upcoming replacement cycle, where we see approximately 240 large freighters that will be over 20 years old by 2019.
While overall airplane demand remains healthy, as always we will continue to keep a watchful eye on evolving market conditions to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. According to IATA, the airline industry is expected to have another record year in 2016 as earnings are projected to rise 10% to $36 billion fueled by lower oil prices, strong passenger demand and airline efficiencies
Additionally, passenger traffic in 2016 is forecast to grow 7% and cargo is forecast to increase 3%. In addition, global GDP is forecast to increase 2.7% in 2016, a healthy level for our industry.
We also continue to see strong growth in Chinese airline traffic. In 2015, passenger traffic in China increased 15% compared to GDP growth of 7%,
a steady trend we have seen for the past 5 years. Based on today's Chinese passenger travel, we see the market is currently underserved by approximately 1,000 aircraft. With the middle class population forecast to grow 10% annually through 2025, the market opportunity is significant. Over the next 20 years, we see the Chinese market needing over 6,300 new aircraft.
Specifically related to oil, notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one. And we have seen airlines in the past efficiently adjust to similar market conditions. In periods such as today with higher passenger demand and lower oil prices, airlines deploy new aircraft more for growth rather than replace older assets. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. This ongoing demand, coupled with our sizable backlog of nearly 5,800 aircraft, which is balanced geographically and across customer operating models reinforces our planned production rate increases and we believe, position us for significant revenue, earnings and cash growth in years ahead.
The rapid return on investment from new, more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel environment that is well below the 15-year average, as evidenced by the purchase decisions announced just last week by Southwest and United Airlines. As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically-advanced aircraft also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increase residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
We're also seeing further strength in the aircraft financing market as financiers continue to see commercial aircraft as a good investment. As I alluded to earlier, airplane order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. For 2016, we anticipate a year of healthy order activity and are targeting a book-to-bill of approximately one, supporting our view is the fact that the field requests and cancellations also remain well below the historical average. Overall, our commercial airplane outlook remains positive as we expect the combination of growth and replacements to drive the need for 38,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.
Turning to individual BCA programs given the 737s robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders and continued healthy global demand, we have decided to move ahead with an additional production rate increase in 2019 to 57 aircraft per month.
As we announced previously, we plan to raise production from 42 a month now to 47 in 2017 followed by 52 a month in 2018. We've long maintained a disciplined and conservative approach in assessing future production rate increases and our confidence in the ongoing market demand for the fuel and operating efficiency advantages of the 737 is very high.
Demand also remains strong for the 777X with a backlog of 306 aircraft from 6 customers. 
On the 777, we captured 101 orders over the last 2 years, and earlier this month, we booked orders for another 6 from Air China, putting us off to a good start in 2016. Our 777 backlog stands at 224 aircraft. 
Regarding the transition to the 777X, we indicated last year that we did not anticipate the production rate on the program going below 7 per month. In solidifying our production plan over the past few months, we can confirm that view with a time line for shifting to a 777 production rate of 7 per month, starting in 2017 to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X. 
In terms of production slots, we are sold out on the 777 in 2016. At the 7 per month rate in 2017, we are approximately 80% sold out and feel good about customer demand until the remaining slots, given the airplane's unique and recognized value proposition. 
Furthermore, for 2018, we currently are in a healthy position in the balance of firm and sold slots. On the 787 program, we captured 71 net orders for the year, which further shows the healthy market demand for this compelling wide-body airplane. The 787s backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered 366 787s to date, including more than 70 -9s. 
The top and bottom line outlook for our commercial airplane business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, with planned rate increases on the 737, 787 and 767 smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and deliver on our development programs such as the 777X and the 787-10. 
Now turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. The enacted fiscal year 2016 budget contains increases over 2015 for many of our core programs, including the P-8 Poseidon, the KC-46 A Tanker, Apache and Chinook helicopters, GMD missile defense, commercial crew and space launch system. The budget also added 12 F-18 variant aircraft. The bipartisan budget agreement provides the framework for these results and also bring greater stability to the fiscal year 2017 congressional budget process. 
International demand for offerings remains healthy. In particular, related to rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the fourth quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 33% of our revenue and 40% of our current backlog. And the strength of our defense and space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priority for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Furthermore, we remain focused on investing in BDS future franchise program, which represent critical capabilities for our customers and substantial business opportunities. While we await the outcome of the Long Range Strike evaluation, we continue to leverage capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, new class and other important opportunities, where we are driving new levels of capability and affordability for our customers. 
In summary, our strategies are aligned, which is the realities and the opportunities of our markets, and our teams are focused on delivering solid operating performance. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $96 billion, reflecting a 6% increase from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. 
Core earnings per share totaled $7.72 for the full year, reflecting a strong operating performance across the company that was offset by the $1.61 for the second quarter KC-46 tanker charge and the fourth quarter 747 program charge. 
Operating cash flow for the year was also strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries and solid core operating performance. 
Moving now to our quarterly results on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.6 billion driven largely by solid commercial deliveries and healthy defense revenues. Core operating margins were 5.3%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses, which were offset by the previously announced $885 million pretax charge on the 747 program. The charge reflects the slow recovery in the cargo market that required us to account for the market impact and lower production rates going forward. 
Fourth quarter core earnings per share was $1.60 on solid core operating performance but again offset by the 747 charge. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, our commercial airplane revenue decreased slightly to $16.1 billion due to timing of airplane deliveries. Commercial airplane operating margins were largely impacted by the 747 charge, higher planned research and development spending and the timing of airplane deliveries, all of which was partially offset by continued solid core operating performance and timing of period costs in the quarter. 
For the full year, Commercial Airplanes revenue was a record $66 billion, an increase of 10% as we successfully executed on our backlog. Commercial Airplanes captured $21 billion of net orders during the quarter, so the backlog now of -- stands at $432 billion and nearly 5,800 aircraft. For the full year, we captured $57 billion on 768 net orders. 
Specifically on 787, the team delivered a record 135 787s and ramped up production on 787-9. We've now delivered 74 787-9 aircraft and as planned 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-8 deliveries in 2016.
We also continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we implement additional production efficiencies.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit costs of approximately 40% over the last 240 deliveries. And furthermore, 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 30% since the first delivery. Consistent with our expectations, the 787 program also became cash positive in the fourth quarter.
787 deferred production increased $201 million to $28.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing unit cost reductions.
We expect about the same level of deferred growth in the first quarter. For the full year, the deferred balance -- the deferred production balance is forecasted to be flat year-over-year. 
Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change to this fundamental milestone. 
We remain on track to achieve the 12 per month 787 delivery rate in mid-'16 with suppliers already operating at that production level. We still have work ahead of us on the 787s as we remain focused to consolidate the execution and risk reduction, while improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward, and the team remains focused on these priorities. 
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7.
Fourth quarter revenue, our defense business increased 3% to $7.8 billion and operating margins increased to a record 12.4% due to strong performance across the portfolio.
Revenue at Boeing military aircraft increased 7% to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting from higher volume and delivery mix. BMA operating margins were 13.7% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance and the benefit of higher volumes and mix. 
Network & Space Systems revenues declined to $2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower satellite volume and NS&S generated operating margins of 8.3%.
Global Services & Support reported a 9% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.6 billion on an AEW&C delivery and higher aircraft modernization and sustainment volume. GS&S generated strong operating margin of 13.8% driven by sale of the contract mix and performance.
Defense, Space & Security reported $7 billion in new business in the quarter, and the backlog stands at $58 billion, of which 40% represents customers from outside the United States.
Turning now to Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $3.1 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by solid operating performance across both businesses.
Again, operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance and our continued efforts to drive disciplined cash management.
With regard to capital deployment, we paid $608 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 5 million shares for $750 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2015 repurchase activity to 47 million shares for $6.75 billion.
As Dennis mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion and an increase to our dividend of another 20%. That's up 125% in 3 years. And over the same period, we have lowered our share count by approximately 10% through the repurchase of nearly 120 million shares.
We expect to complete the $14 billion repurchase authorization over approximately, the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our capital deployment strategy demonstrates the strength of our backlog and the confidence in our business going forward. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us. 
Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with 12.$1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide strong liquidity and positions us well going forward
This financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key areas of our business, return cash to shareholders and again, execute on our cash deployment strategies going forward.
Turning now to Slide 10, we'll discuss our outlook for 2016.
Our outlook for 2016 reflects solid core operating performance, while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Revenue for 2016 is forecast to be between $93 billion and $95 billion, reflecting the planned transition to the 737 MAX, lower F-18 and C-17 volume and reduced 747 production and timing of deliveries. We continue to see revenue growth over the remainder of the decade, with 7 more commercial production rate increases planned as we deliver on a robust backlog. 
Core earnings per share guidance for 2016 is set to be between $8.15 and $8.35 per share. Our 2016 commercial airplane revenue guidance is set to be between $64 billion and $65 billion.
The 2016 commercial delivery guidance is between 740 and 745 airplanes. This reflects the decrease in 747 deliveries, driven by the market and resulting production rate decision we talked about earlier. It also reflects the 737 transition to the MAX as we continue to build test airplanes and produce units for 2017 delivery upon certification. And we also see lower 767 deliveries as we ramp-up on the tanker program, again, in preparation for 2017 certification and delivery. 
We expect commercial airplane deliveries to increase in 2017 as we deliver on our planned production rate increases.  
Specifically related to 787 deliveries, as I mentioned earlier, we're currently on plan to increase the production rate to 12 per month by mid-'16. However, 787 deliveries for 2016 will be in line with 2015 levels due to the timing of customer deliveries
Commercial airplane operating margin guidance is approximately 9% on improved operating performance offset by the dilutive impact of higher planned research and development spending, lower volume on 737 MAX transition and higher 787 revenue, combined with further investment that support future business growth.
Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2016 is between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion, reflecting the continued challenging defense DoD environment. And going forward, we expect tanker revenue to increase as we enter into full rate production. We also see long-term growth driven by P-8 services, international rotorcraft and space, along with the potential future franchise programs that Dennis mentioned earlier. 
Operating margin guidance for our defense business is set to be greater than 10%, reflecting continued productivity efforts -- offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix.
Supporting our strategic portfolio announcements, we expect research and development spending for 2016 to be approximately $3.6 billion, with about 75% related to BCA primarily driven by the planned increases in 777X development, while BDS will continue to invest in key strategic opportunities.
We expect operating cash flow for 2016 to be approximately $10 billion, reflecting healthy deliveries, strong operating performance and continued 787 productivity. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and timing of international C-17 receipts that affected 2015 cash flow.
Capital spending guidance for 2016 is set to be approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, expansion of our Boeing in South Carolina to support 787 rate increases and continued investment to support future growth and productivity. 
Consistent with our prior years and given the seasonality of our business as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year. Core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full year earnings and Q1 cash flow is forecast to be at near breakeven, again driven by timing of receipts and expenditures.
The drivers behind our long-term year-over-year cash growth story are unchanged. We continue to expect strong core operating performance, improved 787 productivity, working capital efficiencies and increasing production over the remainder of the decade. While we remain watchful of the current market conditions, healthy passenger traffic, continued aircraft replacement demand and the compelling value proposition our aircraft provides confidence in our backlog
This is combined with the continued progress in derisking our business and accelerating productivity efforts. We will continue the long-term cash flow growth and increase value to all of our stakeholders
Now I'll turn it over -- back over to Dennis for some final thoughts."

Furthermore, we invested in our people and innovation to maintain and grow our competitive advantage, while also continuing to build out capacity to support future production rate increases.
Collectively, our actions strengthen our position as the world's-leading aerospace company and provide tremendous momentum for 2016 and beyond.
Our priorities going forward can be framed by 2 overarching objectives: First, to continue building strength on strength, to deliver on our existing plans and commitments and improve them where needed; and second, to stretch ourselves beyond those plans and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts to achieve our full potential. Achieving both objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, delivering on our development programs, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, driving to world-class levels of productivity and performance through the enterprise, to fund our investments and innovation of growth and to maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which is aimed to position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top- and bottom-line growth and to create ever increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders
Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

You've stuck to the plan on deferred on the 78, and that should be fairly impressive improvement year-over-year, call it $2 billion in rough numbers yet. And then you also raised the dividend fairly significantly in the fourth quarter, and you have a plan, typically, I think it is to buy back about or distribute to shareholders about 80% of your cash flow. So there seems to be a little bit of a disconnect there. And I hate to ask you to be a little bit granular on this, Greg, but could you walk through some of the moving pieces, please?"

Some of the things that I'll say kind of headwinds into -- going into '16 offsetting some of that is certainly higher cash tax payments as we improve our unit cost and performance on the 787. So we'll have some of that headwind in this year. Remember, last year, we had a lot of C-17 receipts as we sold the bulk of the final aircraft. And obviously, we got one left that we won't get those obviously, repeat this year. And then just continuing to build inventory obviously on the tanker, as we get ready to deliver that in 2017. And Dennis indicated we had a very successful milestone there recently, so that's going well. And then of course, you've got the MAX transition going on. So those are some of the big moving pieces. And at the same time, the long term kind of view on cash flow remains unchanged, Howard. We expect that to continue to grow. That's driven by the annual improved productivity but also the production rates that we've committed to. As Dennis indicated we're going up on 37 beyond what we described earlier up to 57 a month in 2019. But we also have a number of other rate increases in there on the 37 building to that as well as 787, as I said, tracking well to 12 a month. We have a plan to go to 14. So as we look at it over the long term, we don't see a different view. As far as committing to returning cash to shareholders, as you indicated, we have $14 billion of authorization, and we plan to use it as we have the prior authorization. And we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in a fashion that you've seen over the last couple of years going forward."

The majority of that is in the 737",326,"Yes, let me just add a little color to that, Jason, and then I'll ask Greg to add on as well. If you take a look at this year, again, compared to 2015, as you well noted, our delivery guidance is down about 20 aircraft. The majority of that is in the 737 principally because of the MAX transition as we've always planned. So we'll be building another 2 test aircraft this year. And then we're also building ahead on MAXs that will be ultimately delivered in 2017. But there's about a dozen aircraft in there that are 737 and related to the MAX transition as planned. That's why you see delivery down a bit this year. There's also a bit of a pullback because of our announced reduction in 747 rate. Those are the principal driver in terms of numbers of aircraft. Now to your point, it's really important that we look at this from a long-term view. So while we'll go through a transition in 2016, if you look at the sudden rate ramp-ups ahead of us and look out over the next several years, you'll see that revenue will grow, you'll see that deliveries will grow as we execute on the backlog. And so just stepping back from a year of transition and looking out to 2017, 2018, you'll see revenue growth, you'll see earnings growth, you'll see cash but we remain very confident in that story. And that's backed up by the committed rate ramp-ups that we have in the plan and we're continuing to consistently execute. So it's very important to note that, yes, this year, you'll see a bit of a transition because of the MAX. A temporary reduction in revenue top line, if you will, as a result, but we can tell you very clearly that our long-term view here is increasing top and bottom line performance and cash growth year-over-year.

So this really is a point of transition in particular on the 37 and on the -- obviously, we talked about the 747 market. But I think when you're thinking about the MAX coming into production system, if you think about how smoothly the -9 has come into -- or the 787-8 line, that methodology and that process, the process that were apply there are the exact same ones being applied here to ensure that we have smooth transition and we meet those rate increases and the commitments we made to our customers. So near term transition but absolutely the right thing to do for the long term. And as Dennis indicated, 57 a month is very healthy for us as we look at that order book and percentage sold out. So we feel very comfortable about going up in that rate over the long term, but we want to do it as we have very smoothly and very productively through each one of those increases."

As Greg mentioned earlier, we do have a slightly higher R&D this year, driven primarily by 777X. And we do have lower volume on the 37 line because of the MAX transitions we mentioned earlier.

So when we thinking about market share, it's important to think about both deliveries and future orders. And as we've had the MAX in the marketplace and competing. Based on feedback from our customers, we see that the MAX is providing value proposition beyond our competitors aircraft. So we feel confident about the MAX and its future prospects. You see that reflecting in our rate ramp-up expectations going from the current 42 to 47, 52, and as we've announced today going to 57 a month. We are also mindful that we're going to run a disciplined profitable business. And so as we think about rate ramp-ups, we don't simply make decisions based on market share desires.

It is outpacing GDP and even in places like China, where obviously it's been getting a lot of attention on the economic growth prospects, even during the fourth of '15, just as a reference point as GDP in China fell back to a little under 7%. Airplane passenger traffic growth increased at 15%. So passenger growth continues to outpace GDP. That is a strong trend, it's a long-term trend. And then that's part of what paints a bit more of a bullish view in terms of our growth prospects. You see that reflected in our planned production rate increases.

I'm going to begin by discussing our solid 2015 operating performance, then provide an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail. 
As most of you know, 2016 is a milestone year for Boeing, marking our 100th year in business. Over the past century, successive generations of exceptionally talented and dedicated Boeing employees have passed the torch of ingenuity and innovation to help build the world's largest aerospace company and shape the course of human history along the way. It's our privilege and responsibility in the years ahead to preserve and extend this incredible legacy, and we intend, as we did in 2015, to take Boeing to even greater heights in its second century of aerospace leadership. 
In 2015, we continued to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company. We reported record revenue, solid core earnings per share and strong cash flow. We continued to make strategic investments in our people, products and services to strengthen and grow our Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security businesses. And throughout the year, we demonstrated our commitment to providing increasing returns and significant cash to our shareholders.
For the full year, we repurchased 47 million shares for $6.75 billion, and paid $2.5 billion in dividends. In December, our Board of Directors approved a new $14 billion share repurchase authorization and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This disciplined and balanced cash deployment strategy reflects continued confidence in our large and diverse backlog, our strong product portfolio and an overall healthy outlook in the global aerospace and defense industry. 
Now turning to our core operating performance for the year. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $66 billion, thanks in large part to an industry record 762 deliveries last year, which extended our market share leadership in airplane deliveries to a fourth consecutive year. 
Airplane order activity was healthy as we captured 768 net orders. This further supported our robust backlog of nearly 5,800 airplanes or about 7 years of production at current rates. 
Other key milestones included the rollout of the first 737 MAX, achieving 90% engineering design release on the 787-10 and firm configuration of the 777X. We also began initial introduction of new automation technology on the 777 production line. This technology will be matured on the current line before being transitioned over to the 777X. 
A noteworthy milestone for our industry and others, and for large and small U.S. exporters alike, was the 5-year extension of the U.S. export-import bank. This reauthorization of the bank restores competitive balance in international trade and enables American exporters to compete on a level playing field in tough global markets. 
These developments in sum helped to further derisk our business going forward. We expect a tentative labor agreement reached earlier this month between Boeing and our Puget Sound-based engineering union will have the same effect. With a slate of market-leading development programs underway for our customers, this agreement will provide 6 years of labor stability while recognizing and rewarding our engineering and technical workforce for their important contributions to our ongoing success.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security had a very strong year with solid revenue, healthy margins and progress on critical program milestones. 2015 milestones include the first flight of the KC-46A tanker and its first international sale, to Japan; the first EA-18G delivery to the Australian Air Force; the fourth and final AEW&C delivery to Turkey; the selection of the 747-8 to replace the current U.S. presidential aircraft; and we completed flight software demonstration on the Commercial Crew program. 
2016 is off to a strong start as well, with the KC-46 tanker successfully transferring fuel in flight to an F-16 in just the past few days, a very important accomplishment that is an essential step forward and brings milestones -- and begins our milestone C testing that will lead to a low-rate initial production decision this spring.
Despite the challenging defense environment of the last several years, our team continues to adapt to the shifting dynamics while maintaining its strong performance and investing to be ready for an eventual upturn in the market. 
In summary, our Boeing team produced another strong year of operating performance and cash generation, and we made further strides in derisking our business, all of which positions us well and increases our momentum for 2016 and beyond.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3.
We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace, driven by improving airline profitability, solid passenger traffic growth and meaningful replacement. Traffic data for 2015 illustrates the strength of the passenger market, with global passenger traffic increasing 7% for the year, which was above the 10-year average. In contrast, as we highlighted in our rate reduction announcement last week on the 747-8, the global cargo market recovery stalled during 2015, with the airfreight traffic growing a modest 2% during the year. We remain confident in the long-term recovery in the cargo market and the upcoming replacement cycle, where we see approximately 240 large freighters that will be over 20 years old by 2019.
While overall airplane demand remains healthy, as always, we will continue to keep a watchful eye on evolving market conditions to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. According to IATA, the airline industry is expected to have another record year in 2016 as earnings are projected to rise 10% to $36 billion fueled by lower oil prices, strong passenger demand and airline efficiencies.
Additionally, passenger traffic in 2016 is forecast to grow 7% and cargo is forecast to increase 3%. In addition, global GDP is forecast to increase 2.7% in 2016, a healthy level for our industry.
We also continue to see strong growth in Chinese airline traffic. In 2015, passenger traffic in China increased 15% compared to GDP growth of 7%,
a steady trend we have seen for the past 5 years. Based on today's Chinese passenger travel, we see the market as currently underserved by approximately 1,000 aircraft. With the middle-class population forecast to grow 10% annually through 2025, the market opportunity is significant. Over the next 20 years, we see the Chinese market needing over 6,300 new aircraft.
Specifically related to oil, notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one. And we have seen airlines in the past efficiently adjust to similar market conditions. In periods such as today with higher passenger demand and lower oil prices, airlines deploy new aircraft more for growth rather than replace older assets. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. This ongoing demand, coupled with our sizable backlog of nearly 5,800 aircraft, which is balanced geographically and across customer operating models, reinforces our planned production rate increases and we believe positions us for significant revenue, earnings and cash growth in the years ahead.
The rapid return on investment from new, more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel environment that is well below the 15-year average, as evidenced by the purchase decisions announced just last week by Southwest and United Airlines. As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically-advanced aircraft also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
We are also seeing further strength in the aircraft financing market as financiers continue to see commercial aircraft as a good investment. As I alluded to earlier, airplane order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. For 2016, we anticipate a year of healthy order activity and are targeting a book-to-bill of approximately one. Supporting our view is the fact that deferral requests and cancellations also remain well below the historical average. Overall, our Commercial Airplane outlook remains positive as we expect a combination of growth and replacement to drive the need for 38,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.
Turning to individual BCA programs. Given the 737s robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders and continued healthy global demand, we have decided to move ahead with an additional production rate increase in 2019 to 57 aircraft per month.
As we announced previously, we plan to raise production from 42 a month now to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018. We have long maintained a disciplined and conservative approach in assessing future production rate increases and our confidence in the ongoing market demand for the fuel and operating efficiency advantages of the 737 is very high.
Demand also remains strong for the 777X with a backlog of 306 aircraft from 6 customers. 
On the 777, we captured 101 orders over the last 2 years, and earlier this month, we booked orders for another 6 from Air China, putting us off to a good start in 2016. Our 777 backlog stands at 224 aircraft. 
Regarding the transition to the 777X, we indicated last year that we did not anticipate the production rate on the program going below 7 per month. In solidifying our production plan over the past few months, we can confirm that view, with a time line for shifting to a 777 production rate of 7 per month starting in 2017 to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X. 
In terms of production slots, we are sold out on the 777 in 2016. At the 7 per month rate in 2017, we are approximately 80% sold out and feel good about customer demand to fill the remaining slots, given the airplane's unique and recognized value proposition. 
Furthermore, for 2018, we currently are in a healthy position in the balance of firm and sold slots. On the 787 program, we captured 71 net orders for the year, which further shows the healthy market demand for this compelling wide-body airplane. The 787's backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered 366 787s to date, including more than 70 -9s. 
The top and bottom line outlook for our Commercial Airplane business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, with planned rate increases on the 737, 787 and 767, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and deliver on our development programs such as the 777X and the 787-10. 
Now turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. The enacted fiscal year 2016 budget contains increases over 2015 for many of our core programs, including the P-8 Poseidon, the KC-46 A Tanker, Apache and Chinook helicopters, GMD missile defense, commercial crew and space launch system. The budget also added 12 F-18 variant aircraft. The bipartisan budget agreement provided the framework for these results and will also bring greater stability to the fiscal year 2017 congressional budget process. 
International demand for our offerings remains healthy. In particular related to rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the fourth quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 33% of our revenue and 40% of our current backlog. And the strength of our Defense and Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers such as Commercial derivatives, Space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Furthermore, we remain focused on investing in BDS' future franchise programs, which represent critical capabilities for our customers and substantial business opportunities. While we await the outcome of the Long Range Strike evaluation, we continue to leverage capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, new class and other important opportunities where we are driving new levels of capability and affordability for our customers. 
In summary, our strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets, and our teams are focused on delivering solid operating performance.

Moving now to our quarterly results on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, driven largely by solid Commercial deliveries and healthy Defense revenues. Core operating margins were 5.3%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses, which were offset by the previously announced $885 million pretax charge on the 747 program. The charge reflects the slow recovery in the cargo market that required us to account for the market impact and lower production rates going forward. 
Fourth quarter core earnings per share was $1.60 on solid core operating performance, but again offset by the 747 charge. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane revenue decreased slightly to $16.1 billion due to timing of airplane deliveries. Commercial Airplane operating margins were largely impacted by the 747 charge, higher planned research and development spending and the timing of airplane deliveries, all of which was partially offset by continued solid core operating performance and timing of period costs in the quarter. 
For the full year, Commercial Airplanes revenue was a record $66 billion, an increase of 10% as we successfully executed on our backlog. Commercial Airplanes captured $21 billion of net orders during the quarter to a backlog now of -- that stands at $432 billion and nearly 5,800 aircraft. For the full year, we captured $57 billion on 768 net orders. 
Specifically on 787, the team delivered a record 135 787s and ramped up production on the 787-9. They've now delivered 74 787-9 aircraft, and as planned, 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-8 deliveries in 2016.
We also continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we implement additional production efficiencies.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit costs of approximately 40% over the last 240 deliveries. And furthermore, 787-9 unit costs declined approximately 30% since the first delivery. Consistent with our expectations, the 787 program also became cash positive in the fourth quarter.
787 deferred production increased $201 million to $28.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing unit cost reductions.
We expect about the same level of deferred growth in the first quarter. For the full year, the deferred balance -- the deferred production balance is forecasted to be flat year-over-year. 
Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change to this fundamental milestone. 
We remain on track to achieve the 12 per month 787 delivery rate in mid-'16, with suppliers already operating at that production level. We still have work ahead of us on the 787 as we remain focused on solid day-to-day execution and risk reduction, while improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward, and the team remains focused on these priorities. 
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7.
Fourth quarter revenue in our Defense business increased 3% to $7.8 billion and operating margins increased to a record 12.4% due to strong performance across the portfolio.
Revenue at Boeing military aircraft increased 7% to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting from higher volume and delivery mix. BMA operating margins were 13.7% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance and the benefit of higher volumes and mix. 
Network & Space Systems revenues declined to $2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower satellite volume and NS&S generated operating margins of 8.3%.
Global Services & Support reported a 9% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.6 billion on an AEW&C delivery and higher aircraft modernization and sustainment volumes. GS&S generated strong operating margin of 13.8%, driven by favorable contract mix and performance.
Defense, Space & Security reported $7 billion in new business in the quarter, and the backlog stands at $58 billion, of which 40% represents customers from outside the United States.
Turning now to Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $3.1 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by solid operating performance across both businesses.
Again, operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance and our continued efforts to drive disciplined cash management.
With regard to capital deployment, we paid $608 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 5 million shares for $750 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2015 repurchase activity to 47 million shares for $6.75 billion.
As Dennis mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion and an increase to our dividend of another 20%. That's up 125% in 3 years. And over the same period, we have lowered our share count by approximately 10% through the repurchase of nearly 120 million shares.
We expect to complete the $14 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our capital deployment strategy demonstrates the strength of our backlog and the confidence in our business going forward. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priorities for us. 
Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with 12.$1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide strong liquidity and positions us well going forward.
This financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key areas of our business, return cash to shareholders and, again, execute on our cash deployment strategies going forward.
Turning now to Slide 10, we'll discuss our outlook for 2016.
Our outlook for 2016 reflects solid core operating performance, while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Revenue for 2016 is forecast to be between $93 billion and $95 billion, reflecting the planned transition to the 737 MAX, lower F/A-18 and C-17 volume and reduced 747 production and timing of deliveries. We continue to see revenue growth over the remainder of the decade, with 7 more Commercial production rate increases planned as we deliver on our robust backlog. 
Core earnings per share guidance for 2016 is set to be between $8.15 and $8.35 per share. Our 2016 Commercial Airplane revenue guidance is set to be between $64 billion and $65 billion.
The 2016 Commercial delivery guidance is between 740 and 745 airplanes. This reflects the decrease in 747 deliveries driven by the market and resulting production rate decisions we talked about earlier. It also reflects the 737 transition to the MAX as we continue to build test airplanes and produce units for 2017 delivery upon certification. And we also see lower 767 deliveries as we ramp up on the tanker program, again in preparation for 2017 certification and delivery. 
We expect Commercial Airplane deliveries to increase in 2017 as we deliver on our planned production rate increases.  
Specifically related to 787 deliveries, as I mentioned earlier, we're currently on plan to increase the production rate to 12 per month by mid-'16. However, 787 deliveries for 2016 will be in line with 2015 levels due to the timing of customer deliveries.
Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance is approximately 9% on improved operating performance, offset by the dilutive impact of higher planned research and development spending, lower volume on 737 MAX transition and higher 787 revenue, combined with further investments that support future business growth.
Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2016 is between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion, reflecting the continued challenging defense DoD environment. And going forward, we expect tanker revenue to increase as we enter into full-rate production. We also see long-term growth driven by P-8, services, international rotorcraft and Space, along with the potential future franchise programs that Dennis mentioned earlier. 
Operating margin guidance for our Defense business is set to be greater than 10%, reflecting continued productivity efforts across -- offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix.
Supporting our strategic portfolio announcements, we expect research and development spending for 2016 to be approximately $3.6 billion, with about 75% related to BCA, primarily driven by the planned increases in 777X development, while BDS will continue to invest in key strategic opportunities.
We expect operating cash flow for 2016 to be approximately $10 billion, reflecting healthy deliveries, strong operating performance and continued 787 productivity. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and timing of international C-17 receipts that affected 2015 cash flow.
Capital spending guidance for 2016 is set to be approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, the expansion of our Boeing South Carolina to support 787 rate increases and continued investments to support future growth and productivity. 
Consistent with our prior years and given the seasonality of our business, as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year. Core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full year earnings, and Q1 cash flow is forecast to be at near breakeven, again driven by timing of receipts and expenditures.
The drivers behind our long-term year-over-year cash growth story are unchanged. We continue to expect strong core operating performance, improved 787 productivity, working capital efficiencies and increasing production over the remainder of the decade. While we remain watchful of the current market conditions, healthy passenger traffic, continued aircraft replacement demand and the compelling value proposition our aircraft provides confidence in our backlog.
This is combined with the continued progress in derisking our business and accelerating productivity efforts. We will continue the long-term cash flow growth and increase value to all of our stakeholders.
Now I'll turn it over -- back over to Dennis for some final thoughts."

Let me close by saying I remain humbled and privileged to be leading this team and company as we celebrate our centennial year and begin our second century. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team, 2015 was another year of solid core operating performance, where we delivered on our critical strategic initiatives and further derisked our business.
We also continued to convert our robust backlog into cash, and we met our promises by returning more than $9 billion to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
Furthermore, we invested in our people and innovation to maintain and grow our competitive advantage, while also continuing to build out capacity to support future production rate increases.
Collectively, our actions strengthen our position as the world's leading aerospace company and provide tremendous momentum for 2016 and beyond.
Our priorities going forward can be framed by 2 overarching objectives: first, to continue building strength on strength, to deliver on our existing plans and commitments and improve them where needed; and second, to stretch ourselves beyond those plans and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts to achieve our full potential. Achieving both our objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, delivering on our development programs, continuing to strengthen our Defense and Space business, driving to world-class levels of productivity and performance through the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth and to maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which is aimed to position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top- and bottom-line growth and to create ever increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.
Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

You've stuck to the plan on deferred on the 78, and that should be a fairly impressive improvement year-over-year, call it $2 billion in rough numbers,  yet -- and then you also raised the dividend fairly significantly in the fourth quarter.

Some of the things that I'll say kind of are headwinds into -- going into '16, offsetting some of that, is certainly higher cash tax payments as we improved our unit costs and performance on the 787. So we'll have some of that headwind in this year. Remember, last year, we had a lot of C-17 receipts as we sold the bulk of the final aircraft. And obviously, we've got one left that we won't get those, obviously, receipts this year. And then just continuing to build inventory obviously on the tanker, as we get ready to deliver that in 2017. And as Dennis indicated, we had a very successful milestone there recently, so that's going well. And then of course, you've got the MAX transition going on. So those are some of the big moving pieces. And at the same time, the long-term kind of view on cash flow remains unchanged, Howard. We expect that to continue to grow. That's driven by, again, the improved productivity but also the production rates that we've committed to. As Dennis indicated, we're going up on 37 beyond what we'd described earlier, up to 57 a month in 2019. But we also have a number of other rate increases in there on the 37 building to that as well as 787, as I said, tracking well to 12 a month with a plan to go to 14. So as we look at it over the long term, we don't see a different view. As far as committing to returning cash to shareholders, as you indicated, we have $14 billion of authorization, and we plan to use it, as we have the prior authorization. And we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in the fashion that you've seen over the last couple of years going forward."

If you take a look at this year, again, compared to 2015, as you well noted, our delivery guidance is down about 20 aircraft. The majority of that is in the 737, principally because of the MAX transition, as we've always planned. So we'll be building another 2 test aircraft this year. And then we're also building ahead on MAXs that will be ultimately delivered in 2017. But there's about a dozen aircraft in there that are 737 and related to the MAX transition, as planned. That's why you see deliveries down a bit this year. There's also a bit of a pullback because of our announced reduction in 747 rate. So those are the principal drivers in terms of numbers of aircraft. Now to your point, it's really important that we look at this from a long-term view. So while we'll go through a transition in 2016, if you look at the 7 rate ramp-ups ahead of us and look out over the next several years, you'll see that revenue will grow, you'll see that deliveries will grow as we execute on the backlog. And so just stepping back from a year of transition and looking out to 2017, 2018, you'll see revenue growth, you'll see earnings growth, you'll see cash, but we remain very confident in that story. And that's backed up by the committed rate ramp-ups that we have in the plan and we're continuing to consistently execute. So it's very important to note that, yes, this year, you'll see a bit of a transition because of the MAX. A temporary reduction in revenue top line, if you will, as a result, but we can tell you very clearly that our long-term view here is increasing top and bottom line performance and cash growth year-over-year.
Greg, anything you want to add to that?"

So this really is a point of transition, in particular on the 37 and on the -- obviously, we talked about the 747 market. But I think when you're thinking about the MAX coming into production system, if you think about how smoothly the -9 has come into the 74 -- or the 787-8 line, that methodology and that process, the processes that were applied there are the exact same ones being applied here to ensure that we have smooth transition and we meet those rate increases and the commitments we made to our customers. So it's a near-term transition but absolutely the right thing to do for the long term. And as Dennis indicated, 57 a month is very healthy for us as we look at that order book and percentage sold out. So we feel very comfortable about going up in that rate over the long term, but we want to do it as we have, very smoothly and very productively through each one of those increases."

As we've mentioned before, we are driving fundamental productivity with a target of increasing our operating margins to get into that mid-teen range. And that remains our aspirational target. I think it's a challenging but reasonable expectation, and we have a number of affordability and productivity initiatives underway to achieve that. And those were market-based, they include our Partnering for Success effort with our supply chain as well as our Lean and capturing the value of quality efforts within our factory spaces and our office spaces. So that long-term target remains consistent. And we'll continue to drive in that direction. There are a few puts and takes for this year, as you noted. As Greg mentioned earlier, we do have slightly higher R&D this year, driven primarily by 777X. And we do have lower volume on the 37 line because of the MAX transitions we mentioned earlier. And there is some dilution of margins due to higher 87 revenue. So all of those are factored into the guidance that we've given you for the current year.

Prepared questions actually. One first for Greg. I'm curious in terms of the turning cash positive on 787 overall, I'm curious your level of confidence right now in avoiding a forward loss on the 787 program as a whole, and whether or not you see the ramping up ahead as a critical event on getting out of the woods as you kind of are able to really measure your level of productivity improvement. And for Dennis, more of a strategic question. Coming out of '15, you ended -- the market share balance with Airbus on single-aisle aircraft for MAX versus -- from 4,400 to 3,100 roughly. And just strictly on numbers, I think you guys need to beat Airbus by 100 or more orders annually for the next decade and a half roughly to get back to 50%. Just curious what steps you're thinking right now are necessary to regain that market share parity? And what are you thinking about from a strategic perspective that's going to be necessary to do that?"

We remain very confident in the investments we've made in the MAX and its performance in the marketplace. And I recognize the numbers you pointed out there, but I think it's important to note that since we launched the MAX, it's actually been about 50-50 in terms of orders. And we also like to make sure we're looking at deliveries of airplanes. And as noted, again, we were the market leader in total deliveries again this year. So when we thinking about market share, it's important to think about both deliveries and future orders. And as we've had the MAX in the marketplace and competing, based on feedback from our customers, we see that the MAX is providing a value proposition beyond our competitors' aircraft. So we feel confident about the MAX and its future prospects. You see that reflected in our rate ramp-up expectations going from the current 42 to 47, 52, and as we've announced today, going to 57 a month. We are also mindful that we're going to run a disciplined, profitable business. And so as we think about rate ramp-ups, we don't simply make decisions based on market share desires. We make decisions for the long-term perspective of what's going to be valuable to our shareholders. We're going to provide profitable ramp-up and continue to deliver value for our customers. So I think the performance in the marketplace is speaking for itself, and we remain confident in our strategy."

So we have continued to set a tone and a conversation with our workforce that as a company, as a team, we need to recognize the market realities, we need to be competitive and at the same time we want to recognize this great team and treat them with the respect they deserve. So that's been the tone of our discussions. That's been reinforced by Ray and his team in Puget Sound. And together, I think we've engaged in what's been a very productive conversation. We are very supportive of the tentative agreement that's on the table, and we're hopeful that, that will be ratified by the membership over the next few weeks.

If you take a look at GDP projections of about 2.7% growth over the near term and mid term, again that's a balanced view. That's different in different parts of the world, as you well know, but on balance, that's a respectable level for our industry. The key differentiator is we continue to see passenger growth globally increasing at about 6% to 7% a year. It is outpacing GDP, and even in places like China, where obviously it's been getting a lot of attention on the economic growth prospects, even during the fourth quarter of '15, just as a reference point, as the GDP in China fell back to a little under 7%, airplane passenger traffic growth increased at 15%. So passenger growth continues to outpace GDP. That is a strong trend, it's a long-term trend. And then that's part of what paints a bit more of a bullish view in terms of our growth prospects. You see that reflected in our planned production rate increases. And again, we try to be very disciplined about that. We take a long-term view on these rate increase decisions, and those are not made lightly. And we take that balanced view, and the fact that we are ramping up should convey our general confidence in the marketplace and we'll continue to keep a watchful eye on the macroeconomics."

The production rate announcement we've made factors that in. As we get to the 2019 time frame, and you take a look at the pure replacement market that's out there, about 45% of the current fleet will need to be replaced. As I said earlier, we'll have 240 large freighters that will be over 20 years old at that point, so the replacement need is real. And while the 747 is a niche market, it's an important niche market, and one that we think is sustainable. So all of the decisions we've made factor in both the near-term economics as well as this longer-term replacement cycle."

I'm going to begin by discussing our solid 2015 operating performance, then provide an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail. 
As most of you know, 2016 is a milestone year for Boeing, marking our 100th year in business. Over the past century, successive generations of exceptionally talented and dedicated Boeing employees have passed the torch of ingenuity and innovation to help build the world's largest aerospace company and shape the course of human history along the way. It's our privilege and responsibility in the years ahead to preserve and extend this incredible legacy, and we intend, as we did in 2015, to take Boeing to even greater heights in its second century of aerospace leadership. 
In 2015, we continued to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company. We reported record revenue, solid core earnings per share and strong cash flow. We continued to make strategic investments in our people, products and services to strengthen and grow our Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security businesses. And throughout the year, we demonstrated our commitment to providing increasing returns and significant cash to our shareholders.
For the full year, we repurchased 47 million shares for $6.75 billion, and paid $2.5 billion in dividends. In December, our Board of Directors approved a new $14 billion share repurchase authorization and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This disciplined and balanced cash deployment strategy reflects continued confidence in our large and diverse backlog, our strong product portfolio and an overall healthy outlook in the global aerospace and defense industry. 
Now turning to our core operating performance for the year. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $66 billion, thanks in large part to an industry record 762 deliveries last year, which extended our market share leadership in airplane deliveries to a fourth consecutive year. 
Airplane order activity was healthy as we captured 768 net orders. This further supported our robust backlog of nearly 5,800 airplanes or about 7 years of production at current rates. 
Other key milestones included the rollout of the first 737 MAX, achieving 90% engineering design release on the 787-10 and firm configuration of the 777X. We also began initial introduction of new automation technology on the 777 production line. This technology will be matured on the current line before being transitioned over to the 777X. 
A noteworthy milestone for our industry and others, and for large and small U.S. exporters alike, was the 5-year extension of the U.S. export-import bank. This reauthorization of the bank restores competitive balance in international trade and enables American exporters to compete on a level playing field in tough global markets. 
These developments in sum helped to further derisk our business going forward. We expect a tentative labor agreement reached earlier this month between Boeing and our Puget Sound-based engineering union will have the same effect. With a slate of market-leading development programs underway for our customers, this agreement will provide 6 years of labor stability while recognizing and rewarding our engineering and technical workforce for their important contributions to our ongoing success.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security had a very strong year with solid revenue, healthy margins and progress on critical program milestones. 2015 milestones include the first flight of the KC-46A tanker and its first international sale, to Japan; the first EA-18G delivery to the Australian Air Force; the fourth and final AEW&C delivery to Turkey; the selection of the 747-8 to replace the current U.S. presidential aircraft; and we completed flight software demonstration on the Commercial Crew program. 
2016 is off to a strong start as well, with the KC-46 tanker successfully transferring fuel in flight to an F-16 in just the past few days, a very important accomplishment that is an essential step forward and brings milestones -- and begins our milestone C testing that will lead to a low-rate initial production decision this spring.
Despite the challenging defense environment of the last several years, our team continues to adapt to the shifting dynamics while maintaining its strong performance and investing to be ready for an eventual upturn in the market. 
In summary, our Boeing team produced another strong year of operating performance and cash generation, and we made further strides in derisking our business, all of which positions us well and increases our momentum for 2016 and beyond.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3.
We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace, driven by improving airline profitability, solid passenger traffic growth and meaningful replacement. Traffic data for 2015 illustrates the strength of the passenger market, with global passenger traffic increasing 7% for the year, which was above the 10-year average. In contrast, as we highlighted in our rate reduction announcement last week on the 747-8, the global cargo market recovery stalled during 2015, with the airfreight traffic growing a modest 2% during the year. We remain confident in the long-term recovery in the cargo market and the upcoming replacement cycle, where we see approximately 240 large freighters that will be over 20 years old by 2019.
While overall airplane demand remains healthy, as always, we will continue to keep a watchful eye on evolving market conditions to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. According to IATA, the airline industry is expected to have another record year in 2016 as earnings are projected to rise 10% to $36 billion fueled by lower oil prices, strong passenger demand and airline efficiencies.
Additionally, passenger traffic in 2016 is forecast to grow 7% and cargo is forecast to increase 3%. In addition, global GDP is forecast to increase 2.7% in 2016, a healthy level for our industry.
We also continue to see strong growth in Chinese airline traffic. In 2015, passenger traffic in China increased 15% compared to GDP growth of 7%,
a steady trend we have seen for the past 5 years. Based on today's Chinese passenger travel, we see the market as currently underserved by approximately 1,000 aircraft. With the middle-class population forecast to grow 10% annually through 2025, the market opportunity is significant. Over the next 20 years, we see the Chinese market needing over 6,300 new aircraft.
Specifically related to oil, notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one. And we have seen airlines in the past efficiently adjust to similar market conditions. In periods such as today with higher passenger demand and lower oil prices, airlines deploy new aircraft more for growth rather than replace older assets. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. This ongoing demand, coupled with our sizable backlog of nearly 5,800 aircraft, which is balanced geographically and across customer operating models, reinforces our planned production rate increases and we believe positions us for significant revenue, earnings and cash growth in the years ahead.
The rapid return on investment from new, more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel environment that is well below the 15-year average, as evidenced by the purchase decisions announced just last week by Southwest and United Airlines. As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically-advanced aircraft also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
We are also seeing further strength in the aircraft financing market as financiers continue to see commercial aircraft as a good investment. As I alluded to earlier, airplane order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. For 2016, we anticipate a year of healthy order activity and are targeting a book-to-bill of approximately one. Supporting our view is the fact that deferral requests and cancellations also remain well below the historical average. Overall, our Commercial Airplane outlook remains positive as we expect a combination of growth and replacement to drive the need for 38,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.
Turning to individual BCA programs. Given the 737s robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders and continued healthy global demand, we have decided to move ahead with an additional production rate increase in 2019 to 57 aircraft per month.
As we announced previously, we plan to raise production from 42 a month now to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018. We have long maintained a disciplined and conservative approach in assessing future production rate increases and our confidence in the ongoing market demand for the fuel and operating efficiency advantages of the 737 is very high.
Demand also remains strong for the 777X with a backlog of 306 aircraft from 6 customers. 
On the 777, we captured 101 orders over the last 2 years, and earlier this month, we booked orders for another 6 from Air China, putting us off to a good start in 2016. Our 777 backlog stands at 224 aircraft. 
Regarding the transition to the 777X, we indicated last year that we did not anticipate the production rate on the program going below 7 per month. In solidifying our production plan over the past few months, we can confirm that view, with a time line for shifting to a 777 production rate of 7 per month starting in 2017 to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X. 
In terms of production slots, we are sold out on the 777 in 2016. At the 7 per month rate in 2017, we are approximately 80% sold out and feel good about customer demand to fill the remaining slots, given the airplane's unique and recognized value proposition. 
Furthermore, for 2018, we currently are in a healthy position in the balance of firm and sold slots. On the 787 program, we captured 71 net orders for the year, which further shows the healthy market demand for this compelling wide-body airplane. The 787's backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered 366 787s to date, including more than 70 -9s. 
The top and bottom line outlook for our Commercial Airplane business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, with planned rate increases on the 737, 787 and 767, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and deliver on our development programs such as the 777X and the 787-10. 
Now turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. The enacted fiscal year 2016 budget contains increases over 2015 for many of our core programs, including the P-8 Poseidon, the KC-46 A Tanker, Apache and Chinook helicopters, GMD missile defense, commercial crew and space launch system. The budget also added 12 F-18 variant aircraft. The bipartisan budget agreement provided the framework for these results and will also bring greater stability to the fiscal year 2017 congressional budget process. 
International demand for our offerings remains healthy. In particular related to rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the fourth quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 33% of our revenue and 40% of our current backlog. And the strength of our Defense and Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers such as Commercial derivatives, Space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Furthermore, we remain focused on investing in BDS' future franchise programs, which represent critical capabilities for our customers and substantial business opportunities. While we await the outcome of the Long Range Strike evaluation, we continue to leverage capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, new class and other important opportunities where we are driving new levels of capability and affordability for our customers. 
In summary, our strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets, and our teams are focused on delivering solid operating performance. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $96 billion, reflecting a 6% increase from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane bu",1731,"Thanks, Dennis, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $96 billion, reflecting a 6% increase from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. 
Core earnings per share totaled $7.72 for the full year, reflecting a strong operating performance across the company that was offset by the $1.61 for the second quarter KC-46 tanker charge and the fourth quarter 747 program charge. 
Operating cash flow for the year was also strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries and solid core operating performance. 
Moving now to our quarterly results on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, driven largely by solid Commercial deliveries and healthy Defense revenues. Core operating margins were 5.3%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses, which were offset by the previously announced $885 million pretax charge on the 747 program. The charge reflects the slow recovery in the cargo market that required us to account for the market impact and lower production rates going forward. 
Fourth quarter core earnings per share was $1.60 on solid core operating performance, but again offset by the 747 charge. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane revenue decreased slightly to $16.1 billion due to timing of airplane deliveries. Commercial Airplane operating margins were largely impacted by the 747 charge, higher planned research and development spending and the timing of airplane deliveries, all of which was partially offset by continued solid core operating performance and timing of period costs in the quarter. 
For the full year, Commercial Airplanes revenue was a record $66 billion, an increase of 10% as we successfully executed on our backlog. Commercial Airplanes captured $21 billion of net orders during the quarter to a backlog now of -- that stands at $432 billion and nearly 5,800 aircraft. For the full year, we captured $57 billion on 768 net orders. 
Specifically on 787, the team delivered a record 135 787s and ramped up production on the 787-9. They've now delivered 74 787-9 aircraft, and as planned, 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-8 deliveries in 2016.
We also continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we implement additional production efficiencies.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit costs of approximately 40% over the last 240 deliveries. And furthermore, 787-9 unit costs declined approximately 30% since the first delivery. Consistent with our expectations, the 787 program also became cash positive in the fourth quarter.
787 deferred production increased $201 million to $28.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing unit cost reductions.
We expect about the same level of deferred growth in the first quarter. For the full year, the deferred balance -- the deferred production balance is forecasted to be flat year-over-year. 
Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change to this fundamental milestone. 
We remain on track to achieve the 12 per month 787 delivery rate in mid-'16, with suppliers already operating at that production level. We still have work ahead of us on the 787 as we remain focused on solid day-to-day execution and risk reduction, while improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward, and the team remains focused on these priorities. 
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7.
Fourth quarter revenue in our Defense business increased 3% to $7.8 billion and operating margins increased to a record 12.4% due to strong performance across the portfolio.
Revenue at Boeing military aircraft increased 7% to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting from higher volume and delivery mix. BMA operating margins were 13.7% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance and the benefit of higher volumes and mix. 
Network & Space Systems revenues declined to $2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower satellite volume and NS&S generated operating margins of 8.3%.
Global Services & Support reported a 9% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.6 billion on an AEW&C delivery and higher aircraft modernization and sustainment volumes. GS&S generated strong operating margin of 13.8%, driven by favorable contract mix and performance.
Defense, Space & Security reported $7 billion in new business in the quarter, and the backlog stands at $58 billion, of which 40% represents customers from outside the United States.
Turning now to Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $3.1 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by solid operating performance across both businesses.
Again, operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $9.4 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance and our continued efforts to drive disciplined cash management.
With regard to capital deployment, we paid $608 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 5 million shares for $750 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2015 repurchase activity to 47 million shares for $6.75 billion.
As Dennis mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion and an increase to our dividend of another 20%. That's up 125% in 3 years. And over the same period, we have lowered our share count by approximately 10% through the repurchase of nearly 120 million shares.
We expect to complete the $14 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our capital deployment strategy demonstrates the strength of our backlog and the confidence in our business going forward. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priorities for us. 
Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with 12.$1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash position continues to provide strong liquidity and positions us well going forward.
This financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key areas of our business, return cash to shareholders and, again, execute on our cash deployment strategies going forward.
Turning now to Slide 10, we'll discuss our outlook for 2016.
Our outlook for 2016 reflects solid core operating performance, while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Revenue for 2016 is forecast to be between $93 billion and $95 billion, reflecting the planned transition to the 737 MAX, lower F/A-18 and C-17 volume and reduced 747 production and timing of deliveries. We continue to see revenue growth over the remainder of the decade, with 7 more Commercial production rate increases planned as we deliver on our robust backlog. 
Core earnings per share guidance for 2016 is set to be between $8.15 and $8.35 per share. Our 2016 Commercial Airplane revenue guidance is set to be between $64 billion and $65 billion.
The 2016 Commercial delivery guidance is between 740 and 745 airplanes. This reflects the decrease in 747 deliveries driven by the market and resulting production rate decisions we talked about earlier. It also reflects the 737 transition to the MAX as we continue to build test airplanes and produce units for 2017 delivery upon certification. And we also see lower 767 deliveries as we ramp up on the tanker program, again in preparation for 2017 certification and delivery. 
We expect Commercial Airplane deliveries to increase in 2017 as we deliver on our planned production rate increases.  
Specifically related to 787 deliveries, as I mentioned earlier, we're currently on plan to increase the production rate to 12 per month by mid-'16. However, 787 deliveries for 2016 will be in line with 2015 levels due to the timing of customer deliveries.
Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance is approximately 9% on improved operating performance, offset by the dilutive impact of higher planned research and development spending, lower volume on 737 MAX transition and higher 787 revenue, combined with further investments that support future business growth.
Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2016 is between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion, reflecting the continued challenging defense DoD environment. And going forward, we expect tanker revenue to increase as we enter into full-rate production. We also see long-term growth driven by P-8, services, international rotorcraft and Space, along with the potential future franchise programs that Dennis mentioned earlier. 
Operating margin guidance for our Defense business is set to be greater than 10%, reflecting continued productivity efforts across -- offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix.
Supporting our strategic portfolio announcements, we expect research and development spending for 2016 to be approximately $3.6 billion, with about 75% related to BCA, primarily driven by the planned increases in 777X development, while BDS will continue to invest in key strategic opportunities.
We expect operating cash flow for 2016 to be approximately $10 billion, reflecting healthy deliveries, strong operating performance and continued 787 productivity. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and timing of international C-17 receipts that affected 2015 cash flow.
Capital spending guidance for 2016 is set to be approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, the expansion of our Boeing South Carolina to support 787 rate increases and continued investments to support future growth and productivity. 
Consistent with our prior years and given the seasonality of our business, as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year. Core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full year earnings, and Q1 cash flow is forecast to be at near breakeven, again driven by timing of receipts and expenditures.
The drivers behind our long-term year-over-year cash growth story are unchanged. We continue to expect strong core operating performance, improved 787 productivity, working capital efficiencies and increasing production over the remainder of the decade. While we remain watchful of the current market conditions, healthy passenger traffic, continued aircraft replacement demand and the compelling value proposition our aircraft provides confidence in our backlog.
This is combined with the continued progress in derisking our business and accelerating productivity efforts. We will continue the long-term cash flow growth and increase value to all of our stakeholders.
Now I'll turn it over -- back over to Dennis for some final thoughts."

Let me close by saying I remain humbled and privileged to be leading this team and company as we celebrate our centennial year and begin our second century. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team, 2015 was another year of solid core operating performance, where we delivered on our critical strategic initiatives and further derisked our business.
We also continued to convert our robust backlog into cash, and we met our promises by returning more than $9 billion to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
Furthermore, we invested in our people and innovation to maintain and grow our competitive advantage, while also continuing to build out capacity to support future production rate increases.
Collectively, our actions strengthen our position as the world's leading aerospace company and provide tremendous momentum for 2016 and beyond.
Our priorities going forward can be framed by 2 overarching objectives: first, to continue building strength on strength, to deliver on our existing plans and commitments and improve them where needed; and second, to stretch ourselves beyond those plans and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts to achieve our full potential. Achieving both our objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, delivering on our development programs, continuing to strengthen our Defense and Space business, driving to world-class levels of productivity and performance through the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth and to maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which is aimed to position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top- and bottom-line growth and to create ever increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.
Now, we'd be happy to take your questions."

You've stuck to the plan on deferred on the 78, and that should be a fairly impressive improvement year-over-year, call it $2 billion in rough numbers,  yet -- and then you also raised the dividend fairly significantly in the fourth quarter.

Some of the things that I'll say kind of are headwinds into -- going into '16, offsetting some of that, is certainly higher cash tax payments as we improved our unit costs and performance on the 787. So we'll have some of that headwind in this year. Remember, last year, we had a lot of C-17 receipts as we sold the bulk of the final aircraft. And obviously, we've got one left that we won't get those, obviously, receipts this year. And then just continuing to build inventory obviously on the tanker, as we get ready to deliver that in 2017. And as Dennis indicated, we had a very successful milestone there recently, so that's going well. And then of course, you've got the MAX transition going on. So those are some of the big moving pieces. And at the same time, the long-term kind of view on cash flow remains unchanged, Howard. We expect that to continue to grow. That's driven by, again, the improved productivity but also the production rates that we've committed to. As Dennis indicated, we're going up on 37 beyond what we'd described earlier, up to 57 a month in 2019. But we also have a number of other rate increases in there on the 37 building to that as well as 787, as I said, tracking well to 12 a month with a plan to go to 14. So as we look at it over the long term, we don't see a different view. As far as committing to returning cash to shareholders, as you indicated, we have $14 billion of authorization, and we plan to use it, as we have the prior authorization.

So that spending is going to start to ramp up here. But I think for the next couple of years, Cai, you're going to see kind of flattish R&D. And again, that's just some movement between 777X and then 10X winding down. So that's kind of how -- as we see it going forward. On deferred, you're right. I mean we have had some good performance there in the last couple of quarters. And we've assumed some of that going into the balance of this year. So we see similar growth, as I indicated, in the first quarter, and then that will start to moderate. And again, we see that declining shortly after we hit that 12 a month further out into this year. So obviously, it continues to be a big focus area, but the team has done a very good job. And we're assuming additional productivity again through the balance of -- from '15 into the balance of '16."

So as you just pointed out, stepping up to 57 a month in 2019 just continues the trend of confidence that we see in the narrowbody marketplace, in particular. We continue to see strong long-term passenger growth at 6% to 7% a year. That is global in nature. We're seeing that in all of our different market sectors and across all of our different 737 model lines. All of that is telling us that continuing to ramp up production to keep supply and demand in balance is the right thing to do. And as you know, we're very diligent about these rate ramp-ups. We make these decisions with a long-term perspective. And this conveys our confidence in the long-term market and what we're seeing in narrowbody growth. So our plans right now is we transition to the MAX during this coming year, we step up to our 47 a month as planned in 2017, 52 a month in 2018, and now stepping to 57 a month in 2019.

The majority of that is in the 737,",327,"Yes, let me add just a little color to that, Jason, and then I'll ask Greg to add on as well. If you take a look at this year, again, compared to 2015, as you well noted, our delivery guidance is down about 20 aircraft. The majority of that is in the 737, principally because of the MAX transition, as we've always planned. So we'll be building another 2 test aircraft this year. And then we're also building ahead on MAXs that will be ultimately delivered in 2017. But there's about a dozen aircraft in there that are 737 and related to the MAX transition, as planned. That's why you see deliveries down a bit this year. There's also a bit of a pullback because of our announced reduction in 747 rate. So those are the principal drivers in terms of numbers of aircraft. Now to your point, it's really important that we look at this from a long-term view. So while we'll go through a transition in 2016, if you look at the 7 rate ramp-ups ahead of us and look out over the next several years, you'll see that revenue will grow, you'll see that deliveries will grow as we execute on the backlog. And so just stepping back from a year of transition and looking out to 2017, 2018, you'll see revenue growth, you'll see earnings growth, you'll see cash, but we remain very confident in that story. And that's backed up by the committed rate ramp-ups that we have in the plan and we're continuing to consistently execute. So it's very important to note that, yes, this year, you'll see a bit of a transition because of the MAX. A temporary reduction in revenue top line, if you will, as a result, but we can tell you very clearly that our long-term view here is increasing top and bottom line performance and cash growth year-over-year.
Greg, anything you want to add to that?"

So this really is a point of transition, in particular on the 37 and on the -- obviously, we talked about the 747 market. But I think when you're thinking about the MAX coming into production system, if you think about how smoothly the -9 has come into the 74 -- or the 787-8 line, that methodology and that process, the processes that were applied there are the exact same ones being applied here to ensure that we have smooth transition and we meet those rate increases and the commitments we made to our customers. So it's a near-term transition but absolutely the right thing to do for the long term. And as Dennis indicated, 57 a month is very healthy for us as we look at that order book and percentage sold out. So we feel very comfortable about going up in that rate over the long term, but we want to do it as we have, very smoothly and very productively through each one of those increases."

And those were market-based, they include our Partnering for Success effort with our supply chain as well as our Lean and capturing the value of quality efforts within our factory spaces and our office spaces. So that long-term target remains consistent. And we'll continue to drive in that direction. There are a few puts and takes for this year, as you noted. As Greg mentioned earlier, we do have slightly higher R&D this year, driven primarily by 777X. And we do have lower volume on the 37 line because of the MAX transitions we mentioned earlier. And there is some dilution of margins due to higher 87 revenue. So all of those are factored into the guidance that we've given you for the current year.

We remain very confident in the investments we've made in the MAX and its performance in the marketplace. And I recognize the numbers you pointed out there, but I think it's important to note that since we launched the MAX, it's actually been about 50-50 in terms of orders. And we also like to make sure we're looking at deliveries of airplanes. And as noted, again, we were the market leader in total deliveries again this year. So when we thinking about market share, it's important to think about both deliveries and future orders. And as we've had the MAX in the marketplace and competing, based on feedback from our customers, we see that the MAX is providing a value proposition beyond our competitors' aircraft. So we feel confident about the MAX and its future prospects. You see that reflected in our rate ramp-up expectations going from the current 42 to 47, 52, and as we've announced today, going to 57 a month. We are also mindful that we're going to run a disciplined, profitable business. And so as we think about rate ramp-ups, we don't simply make decisions based on market share desires. We make decisions for the long-term perspective of what's going to be valuable to our shareholders. We're going to provide profitable ramp-up and continue to deliver value for our customers. So I think the performance in the marketplace is speaking for itself, and we remain confident in our strategy."

The key differentiator is we continue to see passenger growth globally increasing at about 6% to 7% a year. It is outpacing GDP, and even in places like China, where obviously it's been getting a lot of attention on the economic growth prospects, even during the fourth quarter of '15, just as a reference point, as the GDP in China fell back to a little under 7%, airplane passenger traffic growth increased at 15%. So passenger growth continues to outpace GDP. That is a strong trend, it's a long-term trend. And then that's part of what paints a bit more of a bullish view in terms of our growth prospects.

Steve, that's the decision that we made, that is a sustainable rate position for that line to our bridges to the 2019 replacement cycle. And you're right, when you take a long-term view at the market, although cargo has been flattish during this past year at about 2% growth, and if we look at near-term projections of about 2% to 3% growth, we think that's modest and reasonable. The production rate announcement we've made factors that in. As we get to the 2019 time frame, and you take a look at the pure replacement market that's out there, about 45% of the current fleet will need to be replaced. As I said earlier, we'll have 240 large freighters that will be over 20 years old at that point, so the replacement need is real. And while the 747 is a niche market, it's an important niche market, and one that we think is sustainable. So all of the decisions we've made factor in both the near-term economics as well as this longer-term replacement cycle."

My comments today will focus on our first quarter results, the ongoing health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Boeing delivered solid first quarter 2016 financial results that included higher revenue, increased operating cash flow and core earnings per share that reflect the underlying operating strength of our company. We also continue to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy of investing in innovation, growth and our people and returning cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we've repurchased $3.5 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% for a payout of $717 million. 
Revenue in the first quarter grew to $22.6 billion. Core earnings per share of $1.74 were driven by continued strong operating performance across our core production programs, offset by an additional investment we made to maintain our scheduled commitments on the KC-46 tanker program. Net of tanker, core EPS was strong, and as Greg will outline in more detail, our year-end guidance as reaffirmed, driven by our solid operating performance. 
The $156 million after-tax charge on tanker primarily reflects the cost incorporating engineering changes identified during testing into aircraft already built and in production, along with the certification of those changes. To meet, our commitment to deliver this much-needed capability to U.S. fighters and ramp up production on schedule, we are concurrently building production aircraft while we move through the remaining testing. Overall, we continue to make progress through the late stages of development and ongoing flight testing with all 4 development test aircraft now in the air, giving us confidence to make this investment. We've completed more than 500 flight test hours and refueled an F-16, an F-18 and an A/V 8B Harrier, and we've received feel from a KC-10, all requirements on the path to achieve the milestone C production approval from the U.S. Air Force, which we expect to run the end of the second quarter. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in any large-scale development program, including from start to finishing of flight testing, we remain on path to meet the commitments we've made to our customer, and our team is keen to move forward with production and deliver the first 18 tankers by August 2017. With a long-term market of up to 400 aircraft worth approximately $80 billion, the KC-46 remains a franchise program. And we expect to realize solid returns over decades of productivity and in-service support. 
Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing commercial airplanes, we delivered 176 new Jetliners and added 121 net new orders worth $6 billion. First quarter revenue was $14.4 billion. Operating margins were 7.2%, reflecting overall solid core operating performance, offset by the impact of the tanker charge and planned R&D spending. 
Key milestones in the quarter included the start of 737 MAX flight testing and major assembly of the 787-10 and the launch of the next-generation 737 freighter conversion program. At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, first quarter revenue increased 19% to $8 billion. Operating margins were a healthy 10.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the tanker charge. Key new business awards included a contract from the U.S. Navy for 20 P-8A Poseidon aircraft and finalization of the U.S. Army contract for 117 AH-64 Apache helicopters. 
Also during the quarter, our Puget Sound-based engineering union ratified a new, 6-year contract that will provide labor stability as we move through a flight key development programs while rewarding our world-class engineering and technical workforce for their contributions to our success and strengthening our balance sheet by completing our shift to defined contribution retirement plans for all employees. 
In summary, we reported solid core operating performance, achieved critical milestones and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace, driven by improving airline profitability, strong passenger traffic growth and meaningful replacement demand. According to the International Air Transport Association, passenger traffic is off to its strongest start in 8 years, with traffic growing 8% in early 2016. Over the past 3 years, we've seen passenger traffic growth consistently outpace global GDP and airline capacity growth, a key indicator that supply and demand -- that the supply-and-demand dynamics remains positive. Additionally, global airline load factors are at record levels of about 80% and daily airplane utilization at an all-time high of 9 hours. Both figures attest to the airlines' efficient management of capacity and utilization of assets. In contrast to the strength of passenger traffic, the global air cargo market is off to a slow start this year with air traffic -- airfreight traffic declining 2% over the first 2 months. However, we continue to expect approximately 3% growth for the full year. As always, we continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. 
With regard to oil prices, while we have seen a rebound from the February lows, prices are still well below the 15-year average. With that said, our customers are telling us that current oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. Airplane order activity is continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. Meanwhile, request to change deliveries remained well below its historical average. As a matter fact, in the past year, deferrals, accelerations, debookings and cancellations combined for about 1% of our backlog. That is well below the 6% average over the last 15 years. We believe this speaks to the compelling and enduring value proposition that our airplanes provide to our customers. This ongoing market demand, coupled with our sizable and diverse backlog of more than 5,700 airplanes, reinforces our planned production rate increases through the end of this decade as we ramp up annual deliveries to well above 900 and continues to position us for steady revenue, earnings and cash growth in the years ahead. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remained strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. To satisfy the demand, we remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 a month to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018 and then 57 a month in 2019. The production bridge between the current 737 NG and the MAX remains in an oversold position. To accommodate customers with near-term needs, we will continue to manage the 737 Skyline in a manner that creates value for both us and them. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high. For the current-generation 777, our backlog as of the end of quarter stood at 204 -- excuse me, 205 airplanes. We're sold out of production slots in 2016 and more than 80% sold out in 2017. 
Building on our favorable existing base of sold firm slots, 2018 is a priority for us this year as we work to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X while remaining flexible to respond to market dynamics. So far this year, we've added 11 new 777 orders, a solid first step towards our target of 40 to 50 orders a year to finish filling the 777 production bridge. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of about 750 orders remains the foundation behind our planned production rate increases to 12 per month this year and 14 per month later this decade. In fact, during the quarter, we began final assembly of the 787 program at the 12 per month rate. To date, we've delivered more than 390 787s, including nearly 100 -9, and airplane continues to excel at opening new routes and delivering profitability and performance in operation. 
Finally, the air cargo market headwinds I mentioned earlier continue to pressure demand and pricing for the 747-8 freighter. As you'll recall in the fourth quarter of last year, we made the necessary adjustments to align our 747 production rate to the current market environment. This past quarter, we also recognized an adjustment in market pricing, which Greg will cover in more detail. Thus far this year, we've captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to fill the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market will remain challenging until the air cargo market fully recovers and we reached the 747-400 freighter replacement cycle expected to begin in 2019. 
Overall, the outlook for our Commercial Airplanes business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog with planned rate increases on the 737, 787 and 767, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and 787-10. 
Now turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms amid a diverse global threat environment. Domestically, the President's budget request fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, including the P8 Poseidon, KC-46 tanker, B22 ground-based missile defense, Apache and Chinook helicopters as well as space programs like NASA's new Space Launch System. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular, for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the first quarter, international customers represented 37% of BDS revenue and 37% of the current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investment to innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for customers such as commercial derivatives, space, services, unmanned systems and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. We're also investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer; JSTARS Recapitalization; M2xx, formally known as U class; advanced weapons programs; and other important opportunities. 
One last comment before I pass the mic to Greg. As an enterprise, we remain steadfast and confident about our position and future prospects. Yet, we also recognize that we cannot stand still and sustain our industry leadership in the face of intense competition. For Boeing to continue winning in our second century of business, it is imperative that we seize the initiative to get on and stay on a steep and steady glide path to lower cost performance. We intend to play offense and accelerate our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements throughout the entire One Boeing enterprise and in our supply chain, enhancing affordability and our competitive position in the market, creating capacity to invest, increasing operating margins and driving shareholder value. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and our teams are focused on innovation, growth and delivering solid operating performance. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased to $22.6 billion, driven by solid commercial deliveries and strong defense revenue growth. Core earnings pe",784,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased to $22.6 billion, driven by solid commercial deliveries and strong defense revenue growth. Core earnings per share of $1.74 was impacted by the $0.24 tanker charge and $0.07 747 charge, which is partially offset by improved execution and higher volumes. The 747 charge reflects a change in the estimated revenue on future 747-8 freighter sales. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter, our commercial airplane business reported revenue of $14.4 billion on 176 airplane deliveries and operating margins of 7.2%. Operating margins in the quarter were primarily impacted by the $162 million pretax tanker charge and the $70 million pretax 747 charge as well as higher planned R&D as we ramp up on the 777. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $6 billion of net orders during the first quarter, and the backlog remains very strong at $424 billion and over 5,700 aircraft, equating to more than 7 years of production. 
Specifically, on the 787 program, we've now delivered more than 390 aircraft, including approximately 100 -9s. And as planned, the 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-8 deliveries in 2016. 787 deferred production was better than planned and increased $141 million to $28.7 billion in the first quarter, reflecting the favorable mix towards more -9s as well as continued unit cost reductions. This reflects a 30% decline in quarter-over-quarter deferred production growth. We expect a similar rate of decline in deferred production growth in the second quarter. And for the full year, the deferred production balance should be flat year-over-year. Again, no change to this fundamental milestone. As Dennis indicated, we began final assembly on the 787 program at the 12-per-month rate, and we expect to begin delivery at that rate by mid this year. We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning production of the 787-9, increasing deliveries, reducing production flow times, lowering unit cost and improving overall aircraft reliability. However, more work ahead of us as we strive to further reduce unit cost and smoothly introduce the 787-10 in the production system, which is on track for later this year. 
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. First quarter revenue at our defense business increased 19% to $8 billion, and operating margins were solid at 10.3%, largely driven by strong performance that was offset by the BDS, $81 million, pretax tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue increased 34% to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher F-15 and C-17 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.1% reflect the impact of the tanker charge, partially offset by favorable delivery mix. Network and space assets reported revenue of $1.7 billion, operating margins of 8.5%, reflect the timing of ULA launches. 
Global Services & Support revenue increased 14% to $2.6 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment and training systems. Operating margins of 13.3% [ph] was driven by solid performance and favorable program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog at $56 billion with 37% of that business now from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first quarter was better than planned and was primarily driven by solid operating performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $10 billion with the majority generated in the second half of the year. 
With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $717 million in dividends, and repurchased 29 million shares for $3.5 billion in the first quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence and a long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $10.5 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investments to support future growth, remains top priority for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, segment margins, core earnings, deliveries and cash flow. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results, and we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and providing efficient deployment of that cash. 
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

As we mentioned before, growing our services business across the Boeing enterprise is one of our top priorities going forward. We do see a significant opportunity there. If you look across commercial and defense sectors over the next 20 years, that's about a $4 trillion market space. And we have significant opportunities to grow within that existing market space. Our strategy includes organic investments in areas like parts, streams and our ability to deliver high-value spares to our customers, low-cost modifications and upgrades to existing fleets that leverage our OEM knowledge. And we also see a growing opportunity in some of the information-based services markets and providing value-added services associated with the wealth of information in our new airplanes. So that deep OEM knowledge, we believe, differentiates us in the services marketplace. And we'd like to take some of the prowess that we have in the production capacity and move that into the right cycle support element of the fleet. We're doing that in collaboration with our customers, and in many cases, in collaboration with our supply chain, but we do think that represents significant both top line and bottom line growth opportunity for us. Similarly, in the defense space, we see opportunities to do that and cross-leverage in areas like our commercial derivative platforms. And I think somewhat, uniquely, when we look at our global industrial base and our global presence, our ability to service commercial and defense fleets around the world better than anybody else can be a differentiator for us. So bottom line there, we see services as a big growth opportunity for us. It's primarily organic investment that we're making. And where we can complement that with selected inorganic investments, we will."

One of the reasons we're confident with the production rate adjustments and ramp-ups that we've already announced is that we've factored in those historical trends. Now the fact that the current trends with cancellations and deferrals operating at about 1% of backlog, unfavorable compared to history, just further strengthens our confidence. But the decisions we made to ramp up 737 to 47, 52 and then 57 a month and then the ramp-ups we have planned for 787, all take into context these historical factors. So if we were to see defrozen cancellations began to creep up, we would change our plans. We've, in fact, designed our plans to envelope those historical averages. Now that all said, we're not seeing anything in the data right now nor would I speculate that we're going to see those deferrals and cancellations move back to those historical levels. We continue see strong passenger growth. We are mindful of that quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to watch it closely. But the strength of passenger growth is consistent, so I said about 8% growth so far this year. Independent analysis is saying 6 to 7 growth -- 6% to 7% globally growth, year-over-year. And we're going to continue to watch that and be mindful of it, but all of the trends right now support the analysis that we've done. And even if we would see some creep back towards historical levels, we remain very confident in the production rate decisions we've made. When we -- as you well know, when we go through these production rate decisions, these are not decisions we make lightly. We take a hard look at all of the historical factors, risks and opportunities. And we believe the decisions we've made are well within the envelope of balanced supply and demand."

When you take a look at our fighter lines, it's both domestic and international opportunities. I think it's important to note that, as you've seen in the fiscal year '17 budget deliberations here in the U.S., some strong support from our U.S. Navy requesting additional F-18s for the domestic fleet. And we're hopeful that as part of the FY '17 budget deliberations, that there will be additional super Hornets included in the budget. I think, as you're aware, the U.S. Navy's requests, it's an unfunded request in the system for 14 additional aircraft plus 2 via OCO funding. So there are domestic opportunities and supporting our customer here in the U.S. To make sure that they have the right fighter fleets and capacity for the future, I think, is an important part of the equation. And we continue see strong support for the Super Hornet as well as modifications and upgrades to the F-15 Eagles. Internationally, as you alluded to, there are a number of opportunities and campaigns that are well underway. They are global, including opportunities in the Middle East. And while I can't comment on specific campaigns, I want to respect our customers process here, we do see opportunities in the Middle East. Press reports you've seen around Qatar and Kuwait are certainly 2 very important customers for us. Remember, those are all governed by the foreign military sales process and are government-to-government arrangements. We're supporting those, but we do see opportunities for both the F-18 and the F-15 internationally. Middle East, Asia Pacific, potential opportunities in Europe and Canada as well. And all of those give us some level of confidence that we'll be able to extend those fighter lines into the early 2020s. And that presents an opportunity for us that's important and one that we continue to pursue in that business space, gives us the capacity to invest in future product lines as well that leverage our St. Louis workforce. So we're encouraged by some of the progress there. But again, those international deals are really government-to-government arrangements, and we'll continue to support those appropriately."

When we think about growing the services business, Rob, and then more broadly, lifecycle support, that starts with our customers because our objective here is to make sure that the airplanes we're delivering and the usage they're getting from those airplanes is profitable and productive and reliable. And our business thrives on reliable and productive fleets for our customers, and it's true in both the commercial and defense business. And we believe that our OEM knowledge and depth of detail in the airplane design can add value throughout the entire life cycle. I think, as you're well aware, if you look at the installed commercial fleets, you could argue that we're about 50% of the installed fleet. Yet, if you look at our market share in terms of services today, we're about 6% to 7% market share and services. And I believe it's reasonable for a company like Boeing with the OEM depth and knowledge we have to have a larger share of the services market. And I think that's to the advantage of our customers.

So this is within our planning view. This is not some aspirational target that's out beyond what we envisioned for the business. This is part of our planning effort. And driving that level of productivity and performance is important because it creates the capacity to invest in the future and it creates shareholder value.

Most of that, again driven by passenger growth and the replacement demand from our customers, lesser of that driven by cargo. As I've mentioned earlier, the cargo market remains flattish. The prominent demand there is in the narrowbody arena. So 737 sales opportunities for the MAX remain very robust globally. Widebody demand, not as hot as narrowbody demand, but still strong, especially in areas where it's driven by passenger growth, middle East and Asia Pacific in particular. We're seeing that and continuing solid orders volume for 787 and for the 777. And as I said, on 777, current generation, we're targeting 40 to 50 sales a year to fill the bridge. We still have work to go, but we've completed 11 -- or successfully sold 11 so far this year. So roughly on track. But we still have some work to do to remain -- to fill the remainder of the bridge. We have about a dozen or so very significant campaigns underway for the 777. So while we have work to do, we also see the opportunity to complete filling of that bridge. On the other side of the bridge, the 777X remains in a very strong market-differentiated place.

Book-to-bill of about 1 this year, heavily weighted to the narrowbody side, but seeing reasonable demand in both narrows and widebodies."

So could you talk a little bit about what you're doing? A lot of money on this program and a lot of time and effort, but it's still proving to be a little bit more challenging than you addressed.

And just first of all on your overall margin question, Greg, I look back there to back in the tanker comment on that. But you saw in the first quarter that we did take the $0.24 charge on tanker, we're able to offset a majority of that with just good solid performance. And Greg can walk you through some offsets there. But one of the reasons that we've reaffirmed our year-end guidance is that the first quarter performance that we've seen broadly across the enterprise, some of the work we're doing to drive productivity that I talked about earlier and our plans for the rest of the year, give us confidence that we'll overcome that $0.24 charge. And that's part of the reasons for holding our year-end guidance. And I'll let Greg comment more on that later. But specifically, the tanker, you're right. A lot of focus in that, and I can tell you that we have raised the level of enterprise focus on executing on delivering on the program. We -- as you've seen, we've made some personnel changes to provide some additional oversight and emphasis on the program. Liane, step into our new role as playing a strong role there along with Scott Fancher and teaming up with Ran and came in the commercial airplane side. So we've got the right people in the program. [indiscernible] completing milestone C testing, the production approval position. We are about 80% complete on the flight testing that's required for milestone C. And we are moving towards completion of that milestone and approval around the end of the second quarter. Again, subject to the normal U.S. government process. The next major milestone beyond that will be delivery of the first 18 [ph] tankers, and we remain on schedule to do that August of 2017. And you're right, we have invested some money to hold that schedule. We think it's the right thing to do. It delivers on our customer commitments. It delivers on an important program, and we're committed to hitting that schedule. And it allows us to accelerate our movement into the production program. Ultimately, we still see this in the long run as a franchise program, a market of around 400 aircraft and one that will produce profitable growth for decades to come both in terms of production and support to our customers. So without question, this is an investment worth making. While we don't like taking a charge, we're confident that we're doing the right things here. We've got the right people on it. We are now in the final stages of the development program. And to your point about putting a nail in it, we are not now discovering new technical issues. Frankly, this is about the fact that we are concurrently finishing up development and ramping up production. We've got the first 7 production aircraft flowing through our Everett factory now in our supply chain [indiscernible] out to airplane #15. So see concurrency cost. So that is an intentional investment we're making to keep the program on schedule. We're closing in on it. We're not done yet. We're going to be very focused on getting to the finish line, but I'm confident we'll get there and also confident of its is going to be a great program for our customers and our company for decades to come.

Because when we pursue productivity and cost competitiveness, we look at all categories of costs. So certainly, direct labor cost, headcount is one of those. But there are many other factors. In fact, other factors that are larger than direct headcount. Indirect costs, overhead, infrastructure, facilities, supply chain. Just as a reminder, a good portion of our cost is outside of Boeing. So that's where our Partnering for Success initiative comes in. So we have set cost reduction and productivity targets that span all of those cost categories. In some cases, that does put pressure on headcount, and you've seen that. But it's not something where we set a headcount target or apply the same formula everywhere. It's really important that we give our business leaders and functional leaders the flexibility to tailor their cost structure to be competitive. So it's not a one-size-fits-all, and the business dynamics are very different, and different parts of our business is in different sites. So that's important from an overall context standpoint. Now the reductions that we're making in Puget Sound that you've seen in the news, again those are being done within this overall cost reduction effort and also being done in a way that's very mindful and respectful of our employees. We're starting first, as you noted, with the voluntary layoff packages and/or attrition. I think it's a good reminder that in a company of about 160,000 people, normal annual attrition is about 4% to 5%, just when you look at the workforce demographics. So that alone provides us some flexibility on how we can make headcount reduction and do it in a way that's mindful and respectful of our employees. And so that's where we start. In some cases, we have had had to do involuntary layoffs, but that tends to be on the margins and done very selectively, where we don't have other options. So that's our game plan going forward. I won't give you any specific headcount targets because that's not the way we do our business. We set cost reduction productivity targets. We look at all elements for our cost structure. And if comes down to direct headcount, we deal with that in a way that's very respectful of our employees and trying to do our best to help them transition when that does become a necessity."

You've told your investors over the last 5 years or longer to really focus on cash, not earnings, as you go through the 787 process. But certainly, the windfall that they expect clearly anchors a lot of their expectations for what they see the future of Boeing. So you've got this nascent SEC probe on the projections for 787. You've got downgrades that are causing volatility in your share prices as a result of those projections. I just want to ask, is program accounting still the right model for Boeing? Airbus used IFRS. Bombardier and Embraer and analysts tend to expect a certain level of volatility in the cash that comes in during the development program.

As far as focus on cash, I think just like any business, it's about the bottom line at the end of the day no matter what accounting standards you're under. It's about how efficient you are with your cash and how effective you are with managing that and deploying it. So I wouldn't view our focus on cash, frankly, any different from any other business. At the end of the day, it's all about what's left over. And what your costs were in and what you sold your product for and then what you do with it. And we're trying to keep it simple in that regard because ultimately we want to reinvest in the future and we want to return cash to those that are putting their trust in us through the shareholder base and invest in our people.

As I said earlier, we have set some aggressive cost and cost reduction productivity targets for the year that are aligned with our overall business strategy. And we are looking at all categories of costs. And that includes beyond headcount both in our internal indirect costs as well as in our supply chain. And I think it's important that we continue to keep that in mind. Our direct headcount is one important category but not the only one. And our business leaders are looking across all of those cost categories. I will say the overall macro trend that we have for this year is that we expect employment will be net down moderately. I can't give you a specific number there, but we are on a moderate downward trend enterprise-wide this year as we drive productivity. As I said earlier, we're also doing that trying to be very mindful of our employees. And as you know, we have a great deal of respect for our people. They are world-class. They're the best in the world at what they do. And where we can leverage attrition and the voluntary layoff programs that we put in place, we will. And so far, that approach has been very effective for us, and I think that's good for the business and good for our people. Ultimately, good for our customers. So that's our headset on that approach. On your second question about services, you're right. It's something that we have talked about for some time. I can tell you that we are very serious about growing our services business. So as we laid in our strategy for the next planning cycle, and more broadly for the next decade, that is one of our focused growth areas. The market is large. As I said, about $4 trillion over the next 20 years. We have market share room to grow. But again, I want to emphasize that we are growing services in a growing marketplace. This is not about taking share from others or dividing up a fixed pie. This is clearly a growing marketplace. And with the right kind of business model, this can be good for industry and our customers. We are taking very specific actions on that. Our services business leaders, Stan Deal and Ed DeLansky, are teamed up. I think our One Boeing approach, where we work across commercial and defense globally, is a differentiator for us. In some cases, we are looking at specific parts inside of our aircraft, as you've seen in the [indiscernible] where our unique OEM knowledge, we think, can provide value for our customers. In some cases, we're pursuing modification and upgrade businesses. The 737 freighter conversion program, I think, is a good, specific example there. And then some of the work we're doing in information-based services, like GoldCare and performance-based logistics. Those are specific things that we're doing. So it is a focused, high-priority strategy. And we have actions underway to support that strategy."

My comments today will focus on our first quarter results, the ongoing health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Boeing delivered solid first quarter 2016 financial results that included higher revenue, increased operating cash flow and core earnings per share that reflect the underlying operating strength of our company. We also continue to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy of investing in innovation, growth and our people and returning cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we've repurchased $3.5 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% for a payout of $717 million. 
Revenue in the first quarter grew to $22.6 billion. Core earnings per share of $1.74 were driven by continued strong operating performance across our core production programs, offset by an additional investment we made to maintain our scheduled commitments on the KC-46 Tanker program. Net of Tanker, core EPS was strong, and as Greg will outline in more detail, our year-end guidance is reaffirmed, driven by our solid operating performance. 
The $156 million after-tax charge on Tanker primarily reflects the cost incorporating engineering changes identified during testing into aircraft already built and in production, along with the certification of those changes. To meet our commitment to deliver this much-needed capability to U.S. war fighters and ramp up production on schedule, we are concurrently building production aircraft while we move through the remaining testing. Overall, we continue to make progress through the late stages of development and ongoing flight testing with all 4 development test aircraft now in the air, giving us confidence to make this investment. We've completed more than 500 flight test hours and refueled an F-16, an F/A-18 and an AV-8B Harrier, and we've received fuel from a KC-10, all requirements on the path to achieve the Milestone C production approval from the U.S. Air Force, which we expect around the end of the second quarter. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in any large-scale development program, including from start to finish of flight testing, we remain on path to meet the commitments we've made to our customer, and our team is keen to move forward with production and deliver the first 18 Tankers by August 2017. With a long-term market of up to 400 aircraft worth approximately $80 billion, the KC-46 remains a franchise program, and we expect to realize solid returns over decades of production and in-service support. 
Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, we delivered 176 new jetliners and added 121 net new orders worth $6 billion. First quarter revenue was $14.4 billion. Operating margins were 7.2%, reflecting overall solid core operating performance, offset by the impact of the Tanker charge and planned R&D spending. 
Key milestones in the quarter included the start of 737 MAX flight testing and major assembly of the 787-10 and the launch of the Next-Generation 737 freighter conversion program. 
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, first quarter revenue increased 19% to $8 billion. Operating margins were a healthy 10.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the Tanker charge. Key new business awards included a contract from the U.S. Navy for 20 P-8A Poseidon aircraft and finalization of the U.S. Army contract for 117 AH-64 Apache helicopters. 
Also during the quarter, our Puget Sound-based engineering union ratified a new 6-year contract that will provide labor stability as we move through a slate of key development programs while rewarding our world-class engineering and technical workforce for their contributions to our success and strengthening our balance sheet by completing our shift to defined contribution retirement plans for all employees. 
In summary, we reported solid core operating performance, achieved critical milestones and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace, driven by improving airline profitability, strong passenger traffic growth and meaningful replacement demand. According to the International Air Transport Association, passenger traffic is off to its strongest start in 8 years, with traffic growing 8% in early 2016. Over the past 3 years, we've seen passenger traffic growth consistently outpace global GDP and airline capacity growth, a key indicator that supply and demand -- that the supply-and-demand dynamic remains positive. 
Additionally, global airline load factors are at record levels of about 80% and daily airplane utilization at an all-time high of 9 hours. Both figures attest to the airlines' efficient management of capacity and utilization of assets. In contrast to the strength of passenger traffic, the global air cargo market is off to a slow start this year, with air traffic -- airfreight traffic declining 2% over the first 2 months. However, we continue to expect approximately 3% growth for the full year.  
As always, we continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. 
With regard to oil prices, while we have seen a rebound from the February lows, prices are still well below the 15-year average. With that said, our customers are telling us that current oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. Airplane order activity is continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. Meanwhile, request to change deliveries remain well below its historical average. As a matter of fact, in the past year, deferrals, accelerations, debookings and cancellations combined for about 1% of our backlog. That is well below the 6% average over the last 15 years. We believe this speaks to the compelling and enduring value proposition that our airplanes provide to our customers. 
This ongoing market demand, coupled with our sizable and diverse backlog of more than 5,700 airplanes, reinforces our planned production rate increases through the end of this decade as we ramp up annual deliveries to well above 900 and continues to position us for steady revenue, earnings and cash growth in the years ahead. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remained strong for the 737, with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. To satisfy the demand, we remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 a month to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018 and then 57 a month in 2019. The production bridge between the current 737NG and the MAX remains in an oversold position. To accommodate customers with near-term needs, we will continue to manage the 737 skyline in a manner that creates value for both us and them. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high. For the current-generation 777, our backlog as of the end of the quarter stood at 204 -- excuse me, 205 airplanes. We're sold-out of production slots in 2016 and more than 80% sold-out in 2017. 
Building on our favorable existing base of sold firm slots, 2018 is a priority for us this year as we work to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X while remaining flexible to respond to market dynamics. So far this year, we've added 11 new 777 orders, a solid first step towards our target of 40 to 50 orders a year to finish filling the 777 production bridge. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of about 750 orders remains the foundation behind our planned production rate increases to 12 per month this year and 14 per month later this decade. In fact, during the quarter, we began final assembly on the 787 program at the 12 per month rate. To date, we've delivered more than 390 787s, including nearly 100 -9s, and the airplane continues to excel at opening new routes and delivering profitability and performance in operation. 
Finally, the air cargo market headwinds I mentioned earlier continue to pressure demand and pricing for the 747-8 freighter. As you recall, in the fourth quarter of last year, we made the necessary adjustments to align our 747 production rate to the current market environment. This past quarter, we also recognized an adjustment in market pricing, which Greg will cover in more detail. Thus far, this year, we've captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to fill the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market will remain challenging until the air cargo market fully recovers and we reach the 747-400 freighter replacement cycle expected to begin in 2019. 
Overall, the outlook for our Commercial Airplane business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog with planned rate increases on the 737, 787 and 767, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and 787-10. 
Now turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms amid a diverse global threat environment. Domestically, the President's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, including the P-8 Poseidon, KC-46 Tanker, V-22 ground-based missile defense, Apache and Chinook helicopters as well as space programs like NASA's new Space Launch System. 
Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the first quarter, international customers represented 37% of BDS revenue and 37% of the current backlog. The strength of our Defense & Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investment to innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers such as commercial derivatives, space, services, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. We're also investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, MQ-XX, formerly known as UCLASS, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. 
One last comment before I pass the mic to Greg. As an enterprise, we remain steadfast and confident about our position and future prospects. Yet, we also recognize that we cannot stand still and sustain our industry leadership in the face of intense competition. For Boeing to continue winning in our second century of business, it is imperative that we seize the initiative to get on and stay on a steep and steady glide path to lower cost performance. We intend to play offense and accelerate our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements throughout the entire One Boeing enterprise and in our supply chain, enhancing affordability and our competitive position in the market, creating capacity to invest, increasing operating margins and driving shareholder value. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and our teams are focused on innovation, growth and delivering solid operating performance. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4 and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased to $22.6 billion, driven by solid Commercial deliveries and strong Defense revenue growth. Core earnings per",783,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to Slide 4 and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased to $22.6 billion, driven by solid Commercial deliveries and strong Defense revenue growth. Core earnings per share of $1.74 was impacted by the $0.24 Tanker charge and $0.07 747 charge, which was partially offset by improved execution and higher volumes. The 747 charge reflects a change in the estimated revenue on future 747-8 freighter sales. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $14.4 billion on 176 airplane deliveries and operating margins of 7.2%. Operating margins in the quarter were primarily impacted by the $162 million pretax Tanker charge and the $70 million pretax 747 charge as well as higher planned R&D as we ramp up on the 777X. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $6 billion of net orders during the first quarter, and the backlog remains very strong at $424 billion and over 5,700 aircraft, equating to more than 7 years of production. 
Specifically, on the 787 program, we've now delivered more than 390 aircraft, including approximately 100 -9s. And as planned, the 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-8 deliveries in 2016. 787 deferred production was better than planned and increased $141 million to $28.7 billion in the first quarter, reflecting the favorable mix towards more -9s as well as continued unit cost reductions. This reflects a 30% decline in quarter-over-quarter deferred production growth. We expect a similar rate of decline in deferred production growth in the second quarter. And for the full year, the deferred production balance should be flat year-over-year. Again, no change to this fundamental milestone. As Dennis indicated, we began final assembly on the 787 program at the 12-per-month rate, and we expect to begin delivery at that rate by mid this year. 
We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning production of the 787-9, increasing deliveries, reducing production flow times, lowering unit cost and improving overall aircraft reliability, however, more work ahead of us as we strive to further reduce unit cost and smoothly introduce the 787-10 in the production system, which is on track for later this year. 
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. First quarter revenue at our Defense business increased 19% to $8 billion, and operating margins were solid at 10.3%, largely driven by strong performance that was offset by the BDS $81 million pretax Tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue increased 34% to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher F-15 and C-17 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.1% reflect the impact of the Tanker charge, partially offset by favorable delivery mix. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion. Operating margins of 8.5% reflect the timing of ULA launches. 
Global Services & Support revenue increased 14% to $2.6 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment and training systems. Operating margins of 13.3% was driven by solid performance and favorable program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $56 billion, with 37% of that business now from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first quarter was better than planned and was primarily driven by solid operating performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $10 billion, with the majority generated in the second half of the year.  
With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $717 million in dividends and repurchased 29 million shares for $3.5 billion in the first quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in a long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $10.5 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investments to support future growth, remains top priority for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, segment margins, core earnings, deliveries and cash flow. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results, and we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and providing efficient deployment of that cash.  
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

And as we've mentioned before, growing our services business across the Boeing enterprise is one of our top priorities going forward. We do see a significant opportunity there. If you look across commercial and defense sectors over the next 20 years, that's about a $4 trillion market space. And we have significant opportunities to grow within that existing market space. Our strategy includes organic investments in areas like parts, streams and our ability to deliver high-value spares to our customers, low-cost modifications and upgrades to existing fleets that leverage our OEM knowledge. And we also see a growing opportunity in some of the information-based services markets and providing value-added services associated with the wealth of information in our new airplanes. So that deep OEM knowledge, we believe, differentiates us in the services marketplace, and we'd like to take some of the prowess that we have in the production capacity and move that into the life cycle support element of the fleets. We're doing that in collaboration with our customers, and in many cases, in collaboration with our supply chain. But we do think that represents significant both top line and bottom line growth opportunity for us. Similarly, in the defense space, we see opportunities to do that and cross-leverage in areas like our commercial derivative platforms. And I think somewhat uniquely, when we look at our global industrial base and our global presence, our ability to service commercial and defense fleets around the world better than anybody else can be a differentiator for us. So bottom line there, we see services as a big growth opportunity for us. It's primarily organic investment that we're making. And where we can complement that with selective inorganic investments, we will."

Do planned production rates stick? Do we see a deceleration of the growth in the production rates? Do we need to see production rates decline?

One of the reasons we're confident with the production rate adjustments and ramp-ups that we've already announced is that we've factored in those historical trends. Now the fact that the current trends with the cancellations and deferrals operating at about 1% of backlog are favorable compared to history just further strengthens our confidence. But the decisions we've made to ramp up 737 to 47, 52 and then 57 a month and the ramp-ups we have planned for 787, all take into context these historical factors. So if we were to see deferrals and cancellations begin to creep up, we would change our plans. We've, in fact, designed our plans to envelope those historical averages. Now that all said, we're not seeing anything in the data right now nor would I speculate that we're going to see those deferrals and cancellations move back to those historical levels. We continue to see strong passenger growth. We are mindful of that quarter-over-quarter and we continue to watch it closely. But the strength of passenger growth is consistent, so I said about 8% growth so far this year. Independent analysis is saying 6 to 7 growth -- 6% to 7% globally growth year-over-year. And we're going to continue to watch that and be mindful of it, but all of the trends right now support the analysis that we've done. And even if we would see some creep back towards historical levels, we remain very confident in the production rate decisions we've made. When we -- as you well know, when we go through these production rate decisions, these are not decisions we make lightly. We take a hard look at all of the historical factors, risks and opportunities. And we believe the decisions we've made are well within the envelope of a balanced supply and demand."

And we're hopeful that as part of the FY '17 budget deliberations, that there will be additional Super Hornets included in the budget. I think, as you're aware, the U.S. Navy's request here has an unfunded request in the system for 14 additional aircraft plus 2 via the OCO funding. So there are domestic opportunities, and supporting our customer here in the U.S. to make sure that they have the right fighter fleets and capacity for the future, I think, is an important part of the equation. And we continue see strong support for the Super Hornet as well as modifications and upgrades to the F-15 Eagles. Internationally, as you alluded to, there are a number of opportunities and campaigns that are well underway. They are global, including opportunities in the Middle East. And while I can't comment on specific campaigns, I want to respect our customer's process here, we do see opportunities in the Middle East. The press reports you've seen around Qatar and Kuwait are certainly 2 very important customers for us. Remember, those are all governed by the foreign military sales process and are government-to-government arrangements. We're supporting those, but we do see opportunities for both the F-18 and the F-15 internationally. Middle East, Asia Pacific, potential opportunities in Europe and Canada as well. And all of those give us some level of confidence that we'll be able to extend those fighter lines into the early 2020s. And that presents an opportunity for us that's important and one that we continue to pursue, and that business space gives us the capacity to invest in future product lines as well that leverage our St. Louis workforce. So we're encouraged by some of the progress there, but again, those international deals are really government-to-government arrangements and we'll continue to support those appropriately."

When we think about growing the services business, Rob, and more broadly, life cycle support, that starts with our customers because our objective here is to make sure that the airplanes we're delivering and the usage they're getting from those airplanes is profitable and productive and reliable. And our business thrives on reliable and productive fleets for our customers. And that's true in both our Commercial and Defense business. And we believe that our OEM knowledge and depth of detail in the airplane design can add value throughout the entire life cycle. I think, as you're well aware, if you look at the installed commercial fleets, you could argue that we're about 50% of the installed fleet. Yet, if you look at our market share in terms of services today, we're about 6% to 7% market share and services. And I believe it's reasonable for a company like Boeing, with the OEM depth and knowledge we have, to have a larger share of the services market. And I think that's to the advantage of our customers. And part of the value equation that we're bringing to bear here is Boeing, with our supply chain, providing better capability, better efficiency, better profitability for our customers, that's adding value both for them and for Boeing. Those are the kind of business models we're pursuing."

But if I look ahead to next year, we are pushing towards returning to double-digit margins in our Commercial Airplane business next year. And when we look at that mid-teens margin, the more aspirational target, this is something that we intend to focus on here over the next several years as we head towards the end of the decade. So this is within our planning view. This is not some aspirational target that's out beyond what we envisioned for the business. This is part of our planning effort. And driving that level of productivity and performance is important because it creates the capacity to invest in the future and it creates shareholder value. And we intend to accomplish all of those objectives. Sub elements of that include the strategy that you've seen us lay out. This is why we're working with our supply chain on Partnering for Success to drive bottom line performance.

Hey, on the overall book-to-bill, yes, once again, this year, we're anticipating a book-to-bill of about 1, so similar to last year. As you know, timing of orders is a little hard to predict. But generally, when we look at order volume and energy in the marketplace, we'd say book-to-bill of about 1 and continuing healthy opportunities around the globe. Most of that, again, driven by passenger growth and the replacement demand from our customers. Lesser of that driven by cargo. As I mentioned earlier, the cargo market remains flattish. The prominent demand there is in the narrowbody arena. So 737 sales opportunities for the MAX remain very robust globally. Widebody demand, not as hot as narrowbody demand, but still strong, especially in areas where it's driven by passenger growth, Middle East and Asia Pacific in particular. We're seeing that in continuing solid orders volume for 787 and for the 777. And as I said, on 777, at current generation, we're targeting 40 to 50 sales a year to fill the bridge. We still have work to go, but we've completed 11 -- or successfully sold 11 so far this year. So roughly on track. But we still have some work to do to remain -- to fill the remainder of the bridge. We have about a dozen or so very significant campaigns underway for the 777. So while we have work to do, we also see the opportunity to complete filling of that bridge. On the other side of the bridge, the 777X remains in a very strong market-differentiated place. And if we look out to the future on widebodies, between 787 and 777X in particular, we feel very strong about the product lineup that we have. So overall, a healthy, steady market demand; book-to-bill of about 1 this year, heavier-weighted to the narrowbody side but seeing reasonable demand in both narrowbodies and widebodies."

And just, first of all, on your overall margin question -- Greg, I'll look back to you on the back end of the Tanker to comment on that. But you saw in the first quarter that we did take the $0.24 charge on Tanker. We were able to offset the majority of that with just good solid performance. And Greg can walk you through some of the offsets there. But one of the reasons that we've reaffirmed our year-end guidance is that the first quarter performance that we've seen broadly across the enterprise, some of the work we're doing to drive productivity that I talked about earlier and our plans for the rest of the year, give us confidence that we'll overcome that $0.24 charge, and that's one of the reasons we're holding our year-end guidance. And I'll let Greg comment more on that later. But specifically, the Tanker, you're right, a lot of focus on that, and I can tell you that we have raised the level of enterprise focus on executing and delivering on that program. We, as you've seen, made some personnel changes to provide some additional oversight and emphasis on the program. Leanne, as she has stepped into her new role, is playing a strong role there along with Scott Fancher and teaming up with Ray and the team on the Commercial Airplane side. So we've got the right people on the program. Key milestones ahead of us is completing Milestone C testing, the production approval decision. We are about 80% complete on the flight testing that's required for Milestone C. And we are moving towards completion of that milestone and approval around the end of the second quarter. Again, that's subject to the normal U.S. government process. The next major milestone beyond that will be delivery of the first 18 Tankers, and we remain on schedule to do that August of 2017. And you're right, we have invested some money to hold that schedule. We think it's the right thing to do. It delivers on our customer commitments. It delivers on an important program. And we're committed to hitting that schedule, and it allows us to accelerate our movement into the production program. Ultimately, we still see this in the long run as a franchise program, a market of around 400 aircraft and one that will produce profitable growth for decades to come, both in terms of production and support to our customers. So without question, this is an investment worth making. While we don't like taking a charge, we're confident that we're doing the right things here. We've got the right people on it. We are now in the final stages of the development program. And to your point about putting a nail in it, we are not now discovering new technical issues. Frankly, this is about the fact that we are concurrently finishing up development and ramping up production. We've got the first 7 production aircraft flowing through our Everett factory now in our supply chain. We're already out to airplane #15. So you can see there's some concurrency cost. That is an intentional investment we're making to keep the program on schedule. We're closing in on it. We're not done yet. We're going to be very focused on getting to the finish line. But I'm confident we'll get there and also confident that this is going to be a great program for our customers and our company for decades to come.

Let me give you a little context around this because when we pursue productivity and cost competitiveness, we look at all categories of costs. So certainly, direct labor cost, headcount is one of those. But there are many other factors, in fact, other factors that are larger than direct headcount. Indirect costs, overhead, infrastructure, facilities, supply chain. Just as a reminder, a good portion of our cost is outside of Boeing. So that's where our Partnering for Success initiative comes in. So we have set cost reduction and productivity targets that span all of those cost categories. In some cases, that does put pressure on headcount, and you've seen that, but it's not something where we set a headcount target or apply the same formula everywhere. It's really important that we give our business leaders and functional leaders the flexibility to tailor their cost structure to be competitive. So it's not a one-size-fits-all, and the business dynamics are very different, and different parts of our business is in different sites. So that's important from an overall context standpoint. Now the reductions that we're making in Puget Sound that you've seen in the news, again, those are being done within this overall cost reduction effort and also being done in a way that's very mindful and respectful of our employees. We're starting first, as you noted, with the voluntary layoff packages and/or attrition. And I think it's a good reminder that in a company of about 160,000 people, normal annual attrition is about 4% to 5%, just when you look at the workforce demographics. So that alone provides us some flexibility on how we can make headcount reductions and do it in a way that's mindful and respectful of our employees. And so that's where we start. In some cases, we have had to do involuntary layoffs, but that tends to be on the margins and done very selectively, where we don't have other options. So that's our game plan going forward. I won't give you any specific headcount targets because that's not the way we do our business. We set cost reduction productivity targets. We look at all elements of our cost structure. And if it comes down to direct headcount, we deal with that in a way that's very respectful of our employees and trying to do our best to help them transition when that does become a necessity."

You've told your investors over the last 5 years or longer to really focus on cash, not earnings, as you go through the 787 process. But certainly, the windfall that they expect clearly anchors a lot of their expectations for what they see as the future of Boeing. So you've got this nascent SEC probe on the projections for 787. You've got downgrades that are causing volatility in your share price as a result of those projections. I just want to ask, is program accounting still the right model for Boeing?

So I wouldn't view our focus on cash, frankly, any different than any other business, that at the end of the day, it's all about what's left over and what your costs were in and what you sold your product for and then what you do with it.

As I said earlier, we have set some aggressive cost and cost reduction and productivity targets for the year that are aligned with our overall business strategy. And we are looking at all categories of cost. And that includes beyond headcount, both in our internal indirect costs as well as in our supply chain. And I think it's important that we continue to keep that in mind. Our direct headcount is one important category but not the only one. And our business leaders are looking across all of those cost categories. I will say, the overall macro trend that we have for this year is that we expect employment will be net down moderately. I can't give you a specific number there, but we are on a moderate downward trend enterprise-wide this year as we drive productivity. As I said earlier, we're also doing that trying to be very mindful of our employees. And as you know, I have a great deal of respect for our people. They are world-class. They're the best in the world at what they do. And where we can leverage attrition and the voluntary layoff programs that we've put in place, we will. And so far, that approach has been very effective for us, and I think that's good for the business and good for our people, ultimately, good for our customers. So that's our head set on that approach. On your second question about services, you're right. It's something that we have talked about for some time. I can tell you that we are very serious about growing our services business. So as we've laid in our strategy for the next planning cycle, and more broadly, for the next decade, that is one of our focused growth areas. The market is large. As I said, about $4 trillion over the next 20 years. We have market share room to grow. But again, I want to emphasize that we are growing services in a growing marketplace. This is not about taking share from others or dividing up a fixed pie. This is clearly a growing marketplace. And with the right kind of business model, this can be good for our industry and our customers. We are taking very specific actions on that. Our services business leaders, Stan Deal and Ed Dolanski, are teamed up. I think our One Boeing approach, where we work across commercial and defense globally, is a differentiator for us. In some cases, we are looking at specific parts inside of our aircraft, as you've seen in the news, where our unique OEM knowledge, we think, can provide value for our customers. In some cases, we're pursuing modification and upgrade businesses. The 737 freighter conversion program, I think, is a good, specific example there. And then some of the work we're doing in information-based services, like GoldCare and performance-based logistics. Those are specific things that we're doing. So it is a focused, high-priority strategy. And we have actions underway to support that strategy."

My comments today will focus on our first quarter results, the ongoing health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Boeing delivered solid first quarter 2016 financial results that included higher revenue, increased operating cash flow and core earnings per share that reflect the underlying operating strength of our company. We also continued to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy of investing in innovation, growth and our people and returning cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we've repurchased $3.5 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% for a payout of $717 million. 
Revenue in the first quarter grew to $22.6 billion. Core earnings per share of $1.74 were driven by continued strong operating performance across our core production programs, offset by an additional investment we made to maintain our scheduled commitments on the KC-46 Tanker program. Net of Tanker, core EPS was strong, and as Greg will outline in more detail, our year-end guidance is reaffirmed, driven by our solid operating performance. 
The $156 million after-tax charge on Tanker primarily reflects the cost incorporating engineering changes identified during testing into aircraft already built and in production, along with the certification of those changes. To meet our commitment to deliver this much-needed capability to U.S. warfighters and ramp up production on schedule, we are concurrently building production aircraft while we move through the remaining testing. Overall, we continue to make progress through the late stages of development and ongoing flight testing with all 4 development test aircraft now in the air, giving us confidence to make this investment. We've completed more than 500 flight test hours and refueled an F-16, an F/A-18 and an AV-8B Harrier, and we've received fuel from a KC-10, all requirements on the path to achieve the Milestone C production approval from the U.S. Air Force, which we expect around the end of the second quarter. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in any large-scale development program, including from start to finish of flight testing, we remain on path to meet the commitments we've made to our customer, and our team is keen to move forward with production and deliver the first 18 Tankers by August 2017. With a long-term market of up to 400 aircraft worth approximately $80 billion, the KC-46 remains a franchise program, and we expect to realize solid returns over decades of production and in-service support. 
Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, we delivered 176 new jetliners and added 121 net new orders worth $6 billion. First quarter revenue was $14.4 billion. Operating margins were 7.2%, reflecting overall solid core operating performance, offset by the impact of the Tanker charge and planned R&D spending. 
Key milestones in the quarter included the start of 737 MAX flight testing and major assembly of the 787-10 and the launch of the Next-Generation 737 freighter conversion program. 
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, first quarter revenue increased 19% to $8 billion. Operating margins were a healthy 10.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the Tanker charge. Key new business awards included a contract from the U.S. Navy for 20 P-8A Poseidon aircraft and finalization of a U.S. Army contract for 117 AH-64 Apache helicopters. 
Also during the quarter, our Puget Sound-based engineering union ratified a new 6-year contract that will provide labor stability as we move through a slate of key development programs, while rewarding our world-class engineering and technical workforce for their contributions to our success and strengthening our balance sheet by completing our shift to defined contribution retirement plans for all employees. 
In summary, we reported solid core operating performance, achieved critical milestones and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. We continue to see a generally healthy commercial airplane marketplace, driven by improving airline profitability, strong passenger traffic growth and meaningful replacement demand. According to the International Air Transport Association, passenger traffic is off to its strongest start in 8 years, with traffic growing 8% in early 2016. Over the past 3 years, we've seen passenger traffic growth consistently outpace global GDP and airline capacity growth, a key indicator that supply and demand -- that the supply-and-demand dynamic remains positive. 
Additionally, global airline load factors are at record levels of about 80% and daily airplane utilization at an all-time high of 9 hours. Both figures attest to the airlines' efficient management of capacity and utilization of assets. In contrast to the strength of passenger traffic, the global air cargo market is off to a slow start this year, with air traffic -- airfreight traffic declining 2% over the first 2 months. However, we continue to expect approximately 3% growth for the full year.  
As always, we continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. 
With regard to oil prices, while we have seen a rebound from the February lows, prices are still well below the 15-year average. With that said, our customers are telling us that current oil prices have not substantially changed their views on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. Airplane order activity is continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. Meanwhile, requests to change deliveries remain well below the historical average. As a matter of fact, in the past year, deferrals, accelerations, debookings and cancellations combined for about 1% of our backlog. That is well below the 6% average over the last 15 years. We believe this speaks to the compelling and enduring value proposition that our airplanes provide to our customers. 
This ongoing market demand, coupled with our sizable and diverse backlog of more than 5,700 airplanes, reinforces our planned production rate increases through the end of this decade as we ramp up annual deliveries to well above 900 and continues to position us for steady revenue, earnings and cash growth in the years ahead. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remained strong for the 737, with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. To satisfy the demand, we remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 a month to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 a month in 2018 and then 57 a month in 2019. The production bridge between the current 737NG and the MAX remains in an oversold position. To accommodate customers with near-term needs, we will continue to manage the 737 skyline in a manner that creates value for both us and them. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high. For the current-generation 777, our backlog as of the end of the quarter stood at 204 -- excuse me, 205 airplanes. We are sold out of production slots in 2016 and more than 80% sold out in 2017. 
Building on our favorable existing base of sold firm slots, 2018 is a priority for us this year as we work to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X while remaining flexible to respond to market dynamics. So far this year, we've added 11 new 777 orders, a solid first step towards our target of 40 to 50 orders a year to finish filling the 777 production bridge. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of about 750 orders remains the foundation behind our planned production rate increases to 12 per month this year and 14 per month later this decade. In fact, during the quarter, we began final assembly on the 787 program at the 12 per month rate. To-date, we've delivered more than 390 787s, including nearly 100 -9s, and the airplane continues to excel at opening new routes and delivering profitability and performance in operation. 
Finally, the air cargo market headwinds I mentioned earlier continue to pressure demand and pricing for the 747-8 freighter. As you recall, in the fourth quarter of last year, we made the necessary adjustments to align our 747 production rate to the current market environment. This past quarter, we also recognized an adjustment in market pricing, which Greg will cover in more detail. Thus far this year, we've captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to fill the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market will remain challenging until the air cargo market fully recovers and we reach the 747-400 freighter replacement cycle expected to begin in 2019. 
Overall, the outlook for our Commercial Airplane business remains strong as we continue to execute on our robust backlog with planned rate increases on the 737, 787 and 767, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and 787-10. 
Now turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms amid a diverse global threat environment. Domestically, the President's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, including the P-8 Poseidon, KC-46 Tanker, V-22 ground-based missile defense, Apache and Chinook helicopters, as well as space programs like NASA's new Space Launch System. 
Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the first quarter, international customers represented 37% of BDS revenue and 37% of the current backlog. The strength of our Defense & Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation, along with our continued focus on affordability and productivity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers such as commercial derivatives, space, services, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. We're also investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, MQ-XX, formerly known as UCLASS, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. 
One last comment before I pass the mic to Greg. As an enterprise, we remain steadfast and confident about our position and future prospects. Yet, we also recognize that we cannot stand still and sustain our industry leadership in the face of intense competition. For Boeing to continue winning in our second century of business, it is imperative that we seize the initiative to get on and stay on a steep and steady glide path to lower cost performance. We intend to play offense and accelerate our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements throughout the entire One Boeing enterprise and in our supply chain, enhancing affordability and our competitive position in the market, creating capacity to invest, increasing operating margins and driving shareholder value. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and our teams are focused on innovation, growth and delivering solid operating performance. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4 and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased to $22.6 billion, driven by solid Commercial deliveries and strong Defense revenue growth. Core earnings per",783,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to Slide 4 and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased to $22.6 billion, driven by solid Commercial deliveries and strong Defense revenue growth. Core earnings per share of $1.74 was impacted by the $0.24 Tanker charge and $0.07 747 charge, which was partially offset by improved execution and higher volumes. The 747 charge reflects a change in the estimated revenue on future 747-8 freighter sales. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $14.4 billion on 176 airplane deliveries and operating margins of 7.2%. Operating margins in the quarter were primarily impacted by the $162 million pretax Tanker charge and the $70 million pretax 747 charge as well as higher planned R&D as we ramp up on the 777X. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $6 billion of net orders during the first quarter, and the backlog remains very strong at $424 billion and over 5,700 aircraft, equating to more than 7 years of production. 
Specifically, on the 787 program, we've now delivered more than 390 aircraft, including approximately 100 -9s. And as planned, the 787-9 deliveries will notably exceed 787-8 deliveries in 2016. 787 deferred production was better than planned and increased $141 million to $28.7 billion in the first quarter, reflecting the favorable mix towards more -9s as well as continued unit cost reductions. This reflects a 30% decline in quarter-over-quarter deferred production growth. We expect a similar rate of decline in deferred production growth in the second quarter. And for the full year, the deferred production balance should be flat year-over-year. Again, no change to this fundamental milestone. As Dennis indicated, we began final assembly on the 787 program at the 12-per-month rate, and we expect to begin delivery at that rate by mid this year. 
We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning production of the 787-9, increasing deliveries, reducing production flow times, lowering unit cost and improving overall aircraft reliability. However, more work ahead of us as we strive to further reduce unit cost and smoothly introduce the 787-10 in the production system, which is on track for later this year. 
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. First quarter revenue at our Defense business increased 19% to $8 billion, and operating margins were solid at 10.3%, largely driven by strong performance that was offset by the BDS $81 million pretax Tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue increased 34% to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher F-15 and C-17 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.1% reflect the impact of the Tanker charge, partially offset by favorable delivery mix. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion. Operating margins of 8.5% reflect the timing of ULA launches. 
Global Services & Support revenue increased 14% to $2.6 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment and training systems. Operating margins of 13.3% was driven by solid performance and favorable program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $56 billion, with 37% of that business now from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first quarter was better than planned and was primarily driven by solid operating performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $10 billion, with the majority generated in the second half of the year.  
With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $717 million in dividends and repurchased 29 million shares for $3.5 billion in the first quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in a long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $10.5 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investments to support future growth, remains top priority for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, segment margins, core earnings, deliveries and cash flow. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results, and we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and providing efficient deployment of that cash.  
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

Achieving both objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, continuing to strengthen our Defense & Space business, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth and to create increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.

And as we've mentioned before, growing our services business across the Boeing enterprise is one of our top priorities going forward. We do see a significant opportunity there. If you look across commercial and defense sectors over the next 20 years, that's about a $4 trillion market space. And we have significant opportunities to grow within that existing market space. Our strategy includes organic investments in areas like parts, streams and our ability to deliver high-value spares to our customers, low-cost modifications and upgrades to existing fleets that leverage our OEM knowledge. And we also see a growing opportunity in some of the information-based services markets and providing value-added services associated with the wealth of information in our new airplanes. So that deep OEM knowledge, we believe, differentiates us in the services marketplace, and we'd like to take some of the prowess that we have in the production capacity and move that into the life cycle support element of the fleets. We're doing that in collaboration with our customers, and in many cases, in collaboration with our supply chain. But we do think that represents significant both top line and bottom line growth opportunity for us. Similarly, in the defense space, we see opportunities to do that and cross-leverage in areas like our commercial derivative platforms. And I think somewhat uniquely, when we look at our global industrial base and our global presence, our ability to service commercial and defense fleets around the world better than anybody else can be a differentiator for us. So bottom line there, we see services as a big growth opportunity for us. It's primarily organic investment that we're making. And where we can complement that with selective inorganic investments, we will."

So I think what would be helpful for everyone is to understand what happens to your announced production rates if for whatever reason we accelerate back up to those historic averages on cancellations and deferrals. Do planned production rates stick? Do we see a deceleration of the growth in the production rates? Do we need to see production rates decline?

One of the reasons we're confident with the production rate adjustments and ramp-ups that we've already announced is that we've factored in those historical trends. Now the fact that the current trends with cancellations and deferrals operating at about 1% of backlog are favorable compared to history just further strengthens our confidence. But the decisions we've made to ramp up 737 to 47, 52 and then 57 a month and the ramp-ups we have planned for 787, all take into context these historical factors. So if we were to see deferrals and cancellations begin to creep up, we wouldn't change our plans. We've, in fact, designed our plans to envelope those historical averages. Now that all said, we're not seeing anything in the data right now nor would I speculate that we're going to see those deferrals and cancellations move back to those historical levels. We continue to see strong passenger growth. We are mindful of that quarter-over-quarter and we continue to watch it closely. But the strength of passenger growth is consistent, so I said about 8% growth so far this year. Independent analysis is saying 6 to 7 growth -- 6% to 7% globally growth year-over-year. And we're going to continue to watch that and be mindful of it, but all of the trends right now support the analysis that we've done. And even if we would see some creep back towards historical levels, we remain very confident in the production rate decisions we've made. When we -- as you well know, when we go through these production rate decisions, these are not decisions we make lightly. We take a hard look at all of the historical factors, risks and opportunities. And we believe the decisions we've made are well within the envelope of balanced supply and demand."

When you take a look at our fighter lines, it's both domestic and international opportunities. I think it's important to note that, as you've seen in the fiscal year '17 budget deliberations here in the U.S., some strong support from our U.S. Navy requesting additional F-18s for the domestic fleet. And we're hopeful that as part of the FY '17 budget deliberations, that there will be additional Super Hornets included in the budget. I think, as you're aware, the U.S. Navy's request here has an unfunded request in the system for 14 additional aircraft plus 2 via the OCO funding. So there are domestic opportunities, and supporting our customer here in the U.S. to make sure that they have the right fighter fleets and capacity for the future, I think, is an important part of the equation. And we continue see strong support for the Super Hornet as well as modifications and upgrades to the F-15 Eagles. Internationally, as you alluded to, there are a number of opportunities and campaigns that are well underway. They are global, including opportunities in the Middle East. And while I can't comment on specific campaigns, I want to respect our customer's process here, we do see opportunities in the Middle East. The press reports you've seen around Qatar and Kuwait are certainly 2 very important customers for us. Remember, those are all governed by the foreign military sales process and are government-to-government arrangements. We're supporting those, but we do see opportunities for both the F-18 and the F-15 internationally -- Middle East, Asia Pacific, potential opportunities in Europe and Canada as well. And all of those give us some level of confidence that we'll be able to extend those fighter lines into the early 2020s. And that presents an opportunity for us that's important and one that we continue to pursue, and that business space gives us the capacity to invest in future product lines as well that leverage our St. Louis workforce. So we're encouraged by some of the progress there, but again, those international deals are really government-to-government arrangements and we'll continue to support those appropriately."

But if I look ahead to next year, we are pushing towards returning to double-digit margins in our Commercial Airplane business next year. And when we look at that mid-teens margin, the more aspirational target, this is something that we intend to focus on here over the next several years as we head towards the end of the decade. So this is within our planning view. This is not some aspirational target that's out beyond what we envisioned for the business. This is part of our planning effort. And driving that level of productivity and performance is important because it creates the capacity to invest in the future and it creates shareholder value. And we intend to accomplish all of those objectives. Sub elements of that include the strategy that you've seen us lay out. This is why we're working with our supply chain on Partnering for Success to drive bottom line performance. It's our Lean initiative, our Capturing the Value of Quality effort, market-based affordability and frankly, just a relentless pursuit of productivity. That's good business. It's the right way to run the business and we are committed to that path. And that's a path that allows us to compete and win. It allows us to invest in innovation, and it allows us to return value to shareholders. Now, Greg, do you want to add anything to that?"

Hey, on the overall book-to-bill, yes, once again, this year, we're anticipating a book-to-bill of about 1, so similar to last year. As you know, timing of orders is a little hard to predict. But generally, when we look at order volume and energy in the marketplace, we'd say book-to-bill of about 1 and continuing healthy opportunities around the globe. Most of that, again, driven by passenger growth and replacement demand from our customers; lesser of that driven by cargo. As I mentioned earlier, the cargo market remains flattish. The prominent demand there is in the narrowbody arena. So 737 sales opportunities for the MAX remain very robust globally. Widebody demand, not as hot as narrowbody demand, but still strong, especially in areas where it's driven by passenger growth, Middle East and Asia Pacific in particular. We're seeing that in continuing solid orders volume for 787 and for the 777. And as I said, on 777, at current generation, we're targeting 40 to 50 sales a year to fill the bridge. We still have work to go, but we've completed 11 -- or successfully sold 11 so far this year. So roughly on track. But we still have some work to do to remain -- to fill the remainder of the bridge. We have about a dozen or so very significant campaigns underway for the 777. So while we have work to do, we also see the opportunity to complete filling of that bridge. On the other side of the bridge, the 777X remains in a very strong market-differentiated place. And if we look out to the future on widebodies, between 787 and 777X in particular, we feel very strong about the product lineup that we have. So overall, healthy, steady market demand; book-to-bill of about 1 this year, heavier-weighted to the narrowbody side but seeing reasonable demand in both narrowbodies and widebodies."

And just, first of all, on your overall margin question -- Greg, I'll look back to you on the back end of the Tanker to comment on that. But you saw in the first quarter that we did take the $0.24 charge on Tanker. We were able to offset the majority of that with just good solid performance. And Greg can walk you through some of the offsets there. But one of the reasons that we've reaffirmed our year-end guidance is that the first quarter performance that we've seen broadly across the enterprise, some of the work we're doing to drive productivity that I talked about earlier and our plans for the rest of the year, give us confidence that we'll overcome that $0.24 charge, and that's one of the reasons we're holding our year-end guidance. And I'll let Greg comment more on that later. But specifically, the Tanker, you're right, a lot of focus on that, and I can tell you that we have raised the level of enterprise focus on executing and delivering on that program. We, as you've seen, made some personnel changes to provide some additional oversight and emphasis on the program. Leanne, as she has stepped into her new role, is playing a strong role there along with Scott Fancher and teaming up with Ray and the team on the Commercial Airplane side. So we've got the right people on the program. Key milestones ahead of us is completing Milestone C testing, the production approval decision. We are about 80% complete on the flight testing that's required for Milestone C. And we are moving towards completion of that milestone and approval around the end of the second quarter. Again, that's subject to the normal U.S. government process. The next major milestone beyond that will be delivery of the first 18 Tankers, and we remain on schedule to do that August of 2017. And you're right, we have invested some money to hold that schedule. We think it's the right thing to do. It delivers on our customer commitments. It delivers on an important program. And we're committed to hitting that schedule, and it allows us to accelerate our movement into the production program. Ultimately, we still see this in the long run as a franchise program, a market of around 400 aircraft and one that will produce profitable growth for decades to come, both in terms of production and support to our customers. So without question, this is an investment worth making. While we don't like taking a charge, we're confident that we're doing the right things here. We've got the right people on it. We are now in the final stages of the development program. And to your point about putting a nail in it, we are not now discovering new technical issues. Frankly, this is about the fact that we are concurrently finishing up development and ramping up production. We've got the first 7 production aircraft flowing through our Everett factory now in our supply chain. We're already out to airplane #15. So you can see there's some concurrency cost. That is an intentional investment we're making to keep the program on schedule. We're closing in on it. We're not done yet. We're going to be very focused on getting to the finish line. But I'm confident we'll get there and also confident that this is going to be a great program for our customers and our company for decades to come.

Let me give you a little context around this because when we pursue productivity and cost competitiveness, we look at all categories of costs. So certainly, direct labor cost, headcount is one of those. But there are many other factors, in fact, other factors that are larger than direct headcount. Indirect costs, overhead, infrastructure, facilities, supply chain. Just as a reminder, a good portion of our cost is outside of Boeing. So that's where our Partnering for Success initiative comes in. So we have set cost reduction and productivity targets that span all of those cost categories. In some cases, that does put pressure on headcount, and you've seen that, but it's not something where we set a headcount target or apply the same formula everywhere. It's really important that we give our business leaders and functional leaders the flexibility to tailor their cost structure to be competitive. So it's not a one-size-fits-all, and the business dynamics are very different, and different parts of our businesses in different sites. So that's important from an overall context standpoint. Now the reductions that we're making in Puget Sound that you've seen in the news, again, those are being done within this overall cost reduction effort and also being done in a way that's very mindful and respectful of our employees. We're starting first, as you noted, with voluntary layoff packages and/or attrition. And I think it's a good reminder that in a company of about 160,000 people, normal annual attrition is about 4% to 5%, just when you look at the workforce demographics. So that alone provides us some flexibility on how we can make headcount reductions and do it in a way that's mindful and respectful of our employees. And so that's where we start. In some cases, we have had to do involuntary layoffs, but that tends to be on the margins and done very selectively, where we don't have other options. So that's our game plan going forward. I won't give you any specific headcount targets because that's not the way we do our business. We set cost reduction productivity targets. We look at all elements of our cost structure. And if it comes down to direct headcount, we deal with that in a way that's very respectful of our employees and trying to do our best to help them transition when that does become a necessity."

You've told your investors over the last 5 years or longer to really focus on cash, not earnings, as you go through the 787 process. But certainly, the windfall that they expect really anchors a lot of their expectations for what they see as the future of Boeing. So you've got this nascent SEC probe on the projections for 787. You've got downgrades that are causing volatility in your share price as a result of those projections. I just want to ask, is program accounting still the right model for Boeing? And Airbus use IFRS, Bombardier and Embraer. And analysts tend to expect a certain level of volatility in the cash that comes in during a development program. Is this still right for Boeing when you look at all that's transpired in the last few months?"

It's about how efficient you are with your cash and then -- and how effective you are with managing that and deploying it. So I wouldn't view our focus on cash, frankly, any different than any other business, that at the end of the day, it's all about what's left over and what your costs were and what you sold your product for and then what you do with it. And we're trying to keep it simple in that regard because ultimately, we want to reinvest in the future and we want to return cash to those that are putting their trust in us through the shareholder base and invest in our people.

As I said earlier, we have set some aggressive cost and cost reduction and productivity targets for the year that are aligned with our overall business strategy. And we are looking at all categories of cost. And that includes beyond headcount, both in our internal indirect costs as well as in our supply chain. And I think it's important that we continue to keep that in mind. Our direct headcount is one important category but not the only one. And our business leaders are looking across all of those cost categories. I will say, the overall macro trend that we have for this year is that we expect employment will be net down moderately. I can't give you a specific number there, but we are on a moderate downward trend enterprise-wide this year as we drive productivity. As I said earlier, we're also doing that trying to be very mindful of our employees. And as you know, I have a great deal of respect for our people. They are world-class. They're the best in the world at what they do. And where we can leverage attrition and the voluntary layoff programs that we've put in place, we will. And so far, that approach has been very effective for us, and I think that's good for the business and good for our people; ultimately good for our customers. So that's our head set on that approach. On your second question about services, you're right. It's something that we have talked about for some time. I can tell you that we are very serious about growing our services business. So as we've laid in our strategy for the next planning cycle, and more broadly, for the next decade, that is one of our focused growth areas. The market is large. As I said, about $4 trillion over the next 20 years. We have market share room to grow. But again, I want to emphasize that we are growing services in a growing marketplace. This is not about taking share from others or dividing up a fixed pie. This is clearly a growing marketplace. And with the right kind of business model, this can be good for our industry and our customers. We are taking very specific actions on that. Our services business leaders, Stan Deal and Ed Dolanski, are teamed up. I think our One Boeing approach, where we work across commercial and defense globally, is a differentiator for us. In some cases, we are looking at specific parts inside of our aircraft, as you've seen in the news, where our unique OEM knowledge, we think, can provide value for our customers. In some cases, we're pursuing modification and upgrade businesses. The 737 freighter conversion program, I think, is a good, specific example there. And then some of the work we're doing in information-based services, like GoldCare and performance-based logistics. Those are specific things that we're doing. So it is a focused, high-priority strategy. And we have actions underway to support that strategy."

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Our second quarter financial results included both the continued solid underlying operating execution and strong cash flow performance of our commercial and defense businesses and a substantial impact earnings from decisions we made on the 787 and 747 programs and increased investment needed on the KC-46 Tanker program. I'll come back to explain each of those items in a moment, but let me say upfront that we're confident that the decisions we made on the 787 cost reclassification and 747 production were the right proactive ones to reduce future financial risk and strengthen our position and focus going forward. 
The added investment on Tanker, while not insignificant, enabled completion of important testing, while sustaining our view of the long-term multi-decade value of this program will generate for our customers and our shareholders. Excluding those items, both of our businesses produced double-digit margins in the quarter. And we continued to deliver on our commitments to invest in innovation while also returning cash to shareholders. 
We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% over the prior year for a payout of $691 million in the quarter. 
Revenue in the second quarter increased to $24.8 billion on strong commercial airplane deliveries and growth in our services business. We reported a core earnings per share loss of $0.44, reflecting continued solid operating performance across our production programs that partially offset the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. 
On the 787 program, during the quarter, we reached a decision point on whether to move forward and invest funds for the refurbishment and future sale of the 2 remaining initial flight test aircraft. We elected not to do so. And subsequently, we reclassified unit cost associated with those aircraft from program inventory to R&D expense, resulting in a noncash $847 million after-tax earnings impact. 
On the 747 program, we decided to reduce future production expectations and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market. This program assumption changes drove the $814 million after-tax charge in the quarter. These charges also include the write-down of the remaining 747 deferred production cost, which significantly derisked the program going forward. Despite the ongoing challenges of the air cargo market, we continue to see the 747 as a unique and significant value creator for our customers over the long term. 
A $393 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program reflects our assessment of the cost to address previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, including implementation of the hardware solution to resolve the refueling boom axial load issue identified during flight testing, delays in the certification process and concurrency between late-stage development testing and initial production. To the credit of our team working with the Air Force, the hardware solution to the boom worked as planned. With the aircraft's recent success in refueling an F-16, A-10, and and C-17, we have now completed all required testing to receive the Milestone C production approval from our customer, which expected next month. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in the remainder of the flight test program, our team is duly focused on the work ahead on meeting our commitments under the revised program schedule and providing our Air Force customer the best aerial refueling tanker ever built. 
While we were -- we are reducing core EPS guidance for 2016 to reflect the impact of these 3 items I just discovered, we are maintaining our revenue and cash flow guidance based on the underlying strength of our business. Greg will provide more details on that later. 
Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, second quarter revenue increased 3% to $17.5 billion on 199 deliveries. Notwithstanding overall solid core operating performance, the charges and cost reclassification led to an operating earnings loss in the quarter. Key milestones in the quarter included successfully delivering the first 12-per-month rate aircraft on the 787 program, declaring the 787-10 production-ready, opening the 777X Composite Wing Center and completing high-altitude flight testing on the 737 MAX, which continues to run ahead of schedule. 
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. Operating margins were 8.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the Tanker charge. 
Key contract awards during the quarter included an order for 12 CH-47 Chinooks for the Royal Netherlands Air Force and 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters for the Qatar Air Force. 
In summary, notwithstanding the accounting charges and the cost reclassification in the quarter, we had solid underlying operating performance, achieved critical program milestones and returned significant cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. We recently updated our 20-year commercial outlook. And based on solid traffic growth and continue replacement demand, we now forecast nearly $6 trillion of demand for 39,620 Commercial Airplanes, an increase of nearly 1,600 from last year. 
Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year-to-date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish, with year-to-date freight traffic down approximately 1%. We continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced, with particular attention being paid to the widebody segment. 
While oil prices meaningfully rebounded from lows earlier this year, our customers continue to tell us that movements in oil prices have not substantially changed their view on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. As always, we see isolated pockets of market softness such as Russia and Brazil. However, we will continue to manage our skylines to maintain production schedules and health. 
New order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace as indicated by the flow of announcements at Farnborough Air Show. As a result of the compelling and enduring value proposition of our airplanes, requests to change deliveries are holding well below the historical average. Over the past 12 months, deferrals, accelerations [indiscernible] and cancellations remain at about 1% of backlog. 
We continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to ramp up beyond 900 aircraft per year through the end of this decade, driven by ongoing market demand and our sizable and diverse backlog. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remains strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. We remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 per month to 47 in 2017 followed by 52 per month in 2018 and and 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57-per-month rate, we continue to be oversold. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. While long-term demand remains strong, we have seen some hesitation in near-term demand in recent remarks varying by program. For the current generation 777, our backlog as of the end of quarter stood at 175 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 8 net new 7 -- excuse me, we have added 8 net new 777 orders and commitments. For the full year, we are targeting approximately 40 orders as we focus on ensuring a smooth profitable transition to the 777X production. Our 777 delivery slots are completely sold out for 2016 and more than 80% sold out for 2017. For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of the 777X test aircraft, we are nearly 60% sold out at the lower planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month. We are working an active customer pipeline to fill the remaining 2017 and 2018 delivery slots, but we clearly have more work to do over the next few months to hold the current 777 production plans. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high, and the development of this next game-changing widebody remains on track. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of more than 700 orders remains the foundation behind our production rate plans. As we discussed at our investor conference, securing additional orders to solidify our end-of-the-decade 14-per-month production rate plan remains a priority. As always, aligning supply and demand to maximize profitability will guide our decisions on 777 and 787 production plans. 
On the 747 program, as I've mentioned earlier, air cargo market headwinds continue to pressure demand and pricing. So far this year, we have captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to build the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market remains challenging. We will continue to monitor it closely while aggressively driving productivity and cost reduction to win additional orders. 
On the commercial services side. We continue to deliver on our strategy to grow this element of our business. We recently announced agreements with 6 airlines from around the world to provide advanced analytics solutions to increase their efficiency in operating over 500 airplanes. Furthermore, in the largest commercial airplane services deal in Boeing history, Norwegian committed through 2034 to Gold Card Coverage for both its 737 MAX fleet and to expanded coverage of the airline's entire 787 Dreamliner fleet. Our significant global scale and depth, intimate aircraft knowledge and our substantial installed base combined provide a meaningful opportunity to continue growing our services and support business, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrades business as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services. Overall, the outlook for Boeing commercial airplanes remains positive as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, smoothly transitioning 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and the 787-10. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. Domestically, the President's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the second quarter, international customers represented 29% of BDS revenue, 37% of the current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation and affordability as well as leveraging our One Boeing advantage. We continue to focus on areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. We're investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities in technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization M225A, formerly known as UCLASS, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. We're also encouraged by the domestic and international opportunities for our proven, affordable and highly-capable fighter aircraft. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets. Our teams are focused on innovation and growth and on delivering solid operating performance. We remain confident about our position in future prospects. Our focus is on accelerating our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements through the implementation of Lean, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our Second Century design and manufacturing initiatives. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased to $24.8 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries and solid defense revenue. Core earnings per share was a loss of $0.44, impacted by the previously announced $3.23 of charges and cost reclassification. Notwithstanding these impacts, the core business performance was solid in the quarter. 
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. In the second quarter, our commercial airplane business reported revenue of $17.5 billion on 199 airplane deliveries. BC operating margin in the quarter were impacted by the  $2.8 billion related to the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. Results were also impacted by higher planned R&D spending as we ramp up on the 777X program. Excluding the charges and the cost reclassification, BC operating margins were solid at 10.3%. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $11 billion of net orders during the second quarter and backlog remains very strong at 100 -- $417 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, again equating to 7 years of production. 787 deferred production declined by $1 billion in the quarter driven by the cost reclassification, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $27.7 billion. When normalizing for the cost reclassification, deferred was better than planned at an increase of just $33 million. As we previously discussed, recovering the 787 deferred production over the remainder of the decade will be a significant driver of cash flows. Our confidence in this recovery and the cash generation comes from the shifting of the delivery mix from -9s and -10s, improved pricing over the remaining 900 aircraft and supplier step-down pricing as well as internal productivity. We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning to the 12-per-month rate, increasing deliveries of the 787-9, reducing production pull times and lowering unit cost, while introducing the 787-10 into the production system. 
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue our defense business, was $7.2 billion. Operating margins was 8.3%, largely driven by the strong performance that was offset by the BDS $219 million pretax Tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft second quarter revenue was $3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and Chinook deliveries. Operating margins of 5.9% reflect the impact, again of the Tanker charge. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.8 billion, operating margins of 8.5%, reflecting the timing of ULA launches. Global Services & Support revenue increased 12% to $2.4 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment. Operating margins were 11.1%, reflecting program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $55 billion with now 37% of that business from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to the next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the second quarter was primarily driven by solid operating performance. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $691 million in dividends and repurchased 15 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchase to 44 million shares for a total of $5.5 billion, as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders.  Furthermore, this reflects the ongoing confidence in our long-term outlook of our markets and our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $8.5 billion repurchase authorization over approximately next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains top priority for us. 
Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is lowered by $2.05 a share to now be between $6.10 and $6.30, reflecting the second quarter charges and cost reclassification totaling $3.23 that was more than offset by improved core operating performance and tax benefits. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results as we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and efficient deployment at the same time taking appropriate actions to derisk our business going forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

As we move into the second half of 2016 and begin Boeing's second century in operation, we know we cannot stand still if we are to further our industry leadership and honor the rich legacy of generations of talented, hard-working people that built this company. Our teams remain intensely focused on growth, disciplined execution, quality and productivity improvement and meeting our customer commitments. Our priorities are to continue building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans and to stretch beyond those plans by sharpening and accelerating our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent attention to the profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments, innovation and growth and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which is to position Boeing for the next 100 years and continue market leadership, sustain top and bottom line growth and to create increasing value for our customers, our shareholders, our employees and other stakeholders. 
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

We had a little bit better spending with regards to G&A and some other period expense, in particular fleet support. Those were really the primary drivers in the quarter. Just good solid performance across the programs. On the deferred, I'd say the profile of the deferred remains intact of what I've talked about. Again, as we focused on unit cost, day by day, airplane-by-airplane improvement and getting that model mix up with more -9s, and now the introduction of -10, it's all about cash. And how are we improving the overall cash flow of that program? Teams are doing a great job. We got certainly lots of work in front of us. But I think when you're out in the factories today, you'll see some very, very good momentum and very good focus on overall productivity initiatives that are also obviously going to help that cash profile going forward. So the fundamentals, as far as the cash flow story on 787, remain intact."

Again, that's in line with industry practices. At the same time, we're looking at terms across all of our contracts and again looking to get those to industry standards. But ultimately, we want to get those to top quartile standards. And there's no reason why we shouldn't. And frankly, a lot of our supply chain is already there. And then -- and again, finally, on the inventory, we're looking at all aspects mix of the inventory across the programs. Flow time on 787 is a great example of that. And we're going to continue that focus. So I wouldn't view it as anything special or different. Is there enhanced focus on those elements at cash flow? There certainly is. But that's the objective. Certainly, get to industry standards. And then beyond that, as Dennis has talked about, what is top quartile or global industrial champion look like?

Our proprietary parts business in what I'll call the traditional parts and modifications businesses that leverage our OEM knowledge base. It also includes a more significant investment in data analytics and information-based services. And you can see some of the progress on that front. I mentioned a couple in my opening comments. But more broadly, we now have, for example, 60 airlines enrolled in subscription contracts for Boeing maintenance and engineering work. It covers about 2,200 aircraft. We have another 84 customers with about 3,800 aircraft that are benefiting from our airplane health management services. And we still see a lot of runway ahead of us in these data analytics and information-based services agreements where we can add value for customers and also add value for Boeing. And this includes increased focus from our senior executive team on growing services, investments both inside Boeing and with our supply chain, as you pointed out, and we do see this as a long-term growth area both top line and bottom line.

And as I said, in 2017, we already announced we're going to 7-per-month production rate. We're 80% sold out against that production rate. In 2018, as we introduce the 777X into the line, we built test aircraft. As we've announced before, the effective delivery rate in 2018 will drop to 5.5 per month. And we're 60% sold out against that profile. So we know exactly where we're at today. Now the fact is, year-to-date, we've got net orders for 8 777s against a target of approximately 40. So clearly, we have work to do yet over the next few months to fill out that orders book. And we're working hard in a number of key campaigns. Ray and his team are out with our customers. And we are aggressively working that every day. We do see that the value proposition of the airplane is holding up. But the widebody market is clearly a challenging place right now. So we've got work to do to find those additional orders. Now in the case of -- if those orders don't materialize, we're going to continue to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure that we keep supply and demand in balance. That's the key to our future, and we're going to make sure we make a profitable and efficient transition to the 777X. So we're going to continue to work those campaigns hard. We're going to work to fill out the production plans as we currently have laid them out, while being mindful of keeping supply and demand in balance. Now all of this, I think it's important to take a step back from all of this to look at our overall plans over the next 5 years, regardless how that scenario plays out on 777, this is a growing business where we're going to be delivering north of 900 airplanes a year by the end of the decade. And we see this as a year-over-year cash growth business, spanning all of those scenarios that we're talking about. So we're going to do the right thing here, keep widebodies supply and demand in balance, make sure we have the right transition to 777X. And I think it's also worth reminding that, in the long term, the widebody marketplace is still an attractive marketplace. And as you get out into the 2020s, there's a large replacement cycle that's very clear to us. So this is about efficient transition to the 777X, and the 777X is the right airplane for the future, all within the context of a compelling growth story and year-over-year cash growth."

And then in the longer term, towards the end of the decade, headed towards that mid-teen margin aspiration. And that's a tough, challenging target, but I think the right one for this business for the long term. And it will drive the right behaviors and investments for the future. And achieving those kinds of margins spans all of our internal and external works. So it includes our internal productivity work, the relentless focus on Capturing the Value of Quality and our Lean+ efforts, includes our Development Program Excellence initiatives, all the things we're doing to drive internal productivity to incrementally pick up margins. Things like block extensions on our programs are accretive to margins in general as well. And as I mentioned earlier, as we grow the services business, that also tends to be accretive to margins. In parallel with that internal work, we're also working with our supply chain. Partnering For Success is a key element of this. And while we've made a lot of advancements on that front, we still have a lot of work to do across our supply chain. And we'll continue to be relentless there as well.

So I'd say no rock unturned. We're looking for all opportunities. But just think about it as being market-based-type targets that are driven through all the elements of the cost structure, whether it's in home office here or out on the program.

As you know, that's an end of the decade implementation. But if you were to assume holding 12, it pushes that deferred curve out about 6 months. So not a significant impact. When you look at -8 and -9, you saw it when you're out here, the -- I'd say the design improvements that we're taking off the 8 and put on to the 9, now that we're, I'll say, ramping up -- we're right about 10 a month right now in the -9, you're really seeing those come together in the factory. And so unit cost now is about in line with -- on -9 versus -8. So the team again has been a great job. Lots of work in front of us. But the fact is, over 125 units and are now at the same level of -8. I think gives you a good sense of the design for manufacturing implementation that's taken place on that airplane. And listen, there's lot of ideas in the hopper. Some of those will mature. Some of them won't, but they're not slowing down. And Mark Jencks and his team are doing a terrific job looking for more opportunities. Disruption from 9 to 10, I think you said it. It is not as big of an impact certainly as it is from the 8 to 9. That is by design. So that's in the production system today. So we certainly have provision for some longer flow times on those initial -10 units. Similar methodology, I would say, that we did from the 8 to 9. But we're again -- I think as far as producing airplane and a risk associated with that, it's a very different risk profile than it was from the 8 to 9. So again, credit to the team on really focused on commonality in the production system to minimize that disruption as we entered into the production system."

And we're largely focused on filling out the 2020 production skyline. So that will give you feel for the time frame that we're looking at. As Greg said, this is a toward the end of the decade implementation. So you can back off from that a couple of years. Yes, we haven't pinned down a specific decision point yet because we're going to keep a close eye on the market, the signals from our customers. We've got time to do our due diligence here. And again, our principal here is to keep widebody supply and demand in balance. And we're confident in the 787 program across that span of scenarios. And we're going to continue to work campaigns to fill out to the 14-a-month rate step-up. And we'll evaluate timelines and decisions around that. But you can be very confident that whatever we decide, we're going to keep supply and demand in balance. We're going to do it efficiently and productively. And all of this again is enveloped by our expectation of a year-over-year cash growth business that spans all of the scenarios we talked about on both 777 and 787."

I won't be specific to individual customers as we have a number of discussions ongoing, but we have opportunities to accelerate into the first half of the year. And what you should read through that is that the MAX development program is going very well and running on cost and ahead of schedule. We've got all 4 test aircraft in the air, more than 300 hours on the airplanes. And the performance is looking solid. And the development program is clean. And more broadly, to get to your underlying question, I think this is a good example of how we can and should perform coming out of our development program excellence and issue. And this about understanding statement. We're clearly up front, managing that statement keeping it balanced, doing the right systems engineering work, working with our supply chain. This is about disciplined innovation. And we're going to bring it -- a product to the market place that has a great value add for customers and do it in a way that's disciplined and on cost and on schedule. And that formula that we put in place now with our Development Program Excellence initiative, we know it works. And we've taken the lessons learned from MAX. And we're cross-deploying those now in the programs like the 787-10, the 777X and into our future defense development programs. And our objective here is very clear, and that is to have a disciplined, effective development programs to perform on cost and schedule that allows us to do reliable R&D planning and allows us to make best use of our innovation investments. So it's a good signpost for us, Howard. i think clearly a step in the right direction. And we're going to deleverage lessons learned from MAX across the whole enterprise.

Certainly, not all of it is implemented. I wouldn't run with it. But that's the framework. And that's the operating around it. But it's all about, ""How do we compete in the marketplace, no matter what marketplace we're in across the portfolio."" How do we generate cash in order to invest in our future as we have? And then deliver value to shareholders."" So those are kind of the, I'll say, framework that surround the approach. But again, it goes back to my comment about no rock left unturned. So whether it's functional costs that are supporting a program or program-specific, everybody has an affordability target. And again, different levels of maturity.

So a number of very viable campaigns underway to fill to that half-a-month production rate. That said, we still have our work cut out for us. Cargo is a tough market right now. I will say that the decisions we made on 747 are going to put that program in a much more solid footing for the future. It's aligned in the marketplace.

And again, we don't get too encumbered with the exact timing of those orders. And it's very clear that this year's order cycle is more variable on the narrowbodies. And so if you're looking at numbers of aircraft, we expect the predominance of that orders for this year to be in the narrowbodies arena. That all said, we continue to work out to fill out the widebody skylines as well. We don't need to make drastic changes to pricing in order to capture market share. We're not going to be driven to just get market share for market shares' sake. I will say, in the widebody marketplace, even though we're seeing some hesitation in buying, the value proposition of our airplanes is holding up well. So this is all about a look ahead to efficiently managing our production skyline and keeping supply and demand in balance. And clearly, we've got more work to do on the widebody front, while narrowbody orders are turning to be very healthy and continuing to be healthy this year. So that's our headset. And as normal, we do a lot of scenario planning around this and different assumptions around widebody orders and what that future skyline will look like. And as you heard earlier, our commitment is to make the decisions that allow us to make the transition on the 777 efficient and productive. And we will do that."

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Our second quarter financial results included both the continued solid underlying operating execution and strong cash flow performance of our commercial and defense businesses, and a substantial impact earnings from decisions we made on the 787 and 747 programs and increased investment needed on the KC-46 Tanker program. I'll come back to explain each of those items in a moment, but let me say upfront that we're confident that the decisions we made on the 787 cost reclassification and 747 production were the right proactive ones to reduce future financial risk and strengthen our position and focus going forward. 
The added investment on Tanker, while not insignificant, enabled the completion of important testing, while sustaining our view of the long-term multi-decade value this program will generate for our customers and our shareholders. Excluding those items, both of our businesses produced double-digit margins in the quarter. And we continued to deliver on our commitments to invest in innovation while also returning cash to shareholders. 
We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% over the prior year for a payout of $691 million in the quarter. Revenue in the second quarter increased to $24.8 billion on strong commercial airplane deliveries and growth in our services business. We reported a core earnings per share loss of $0.44, reflecting continued solid operating performance across our production programs that partially offset the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. 
On the 787 program, during the quarter, we reached a decision point on whether to move forward and invest funds for the refurbishment and future sale of the 2 remaining initial flight test aircraft. We elected not to do so. And subsequently, we reclassified unit costs associated with those aircraft from program inventory to R&D expense, resulting in a noncash $847 million after-tax earnings impact. 
On the 747 program, we decided to reduce future production expectations and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market. This program assumption changes drove the $814 million after-tax charge in the quarter. These charges also include the write-down of the remaining 747 deferred production cost, which significantly derisked the program going forward. Despite the ongoing challenges of the air cargo market, we continue to see the 747 as a unique and significant value creator for our customers over the long term. 
A $393 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program reflects our assessment of the cost to address previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, including implementation of the hardware solution to resolve the refueling boom axial load issue identified during flight testing, delays in the certification process and concurrency between late-stage development testing and initial production. To the credit of our team working with the Air Force, the hardware solution to the boom issue worked as planned. With the aircraft's recent success in refueling an F-16, A-10 and C-17, we have now completed all required testing to receive the Milestone C production approval from our customer, which is expected next month. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in the remainder of the flight test program, our team is duly focused on the work ahead on meeting our commitments under the revised program schedule and providing our Air Force customer the best aerial refueling tanker ever built. 
While we were -- while we are reducing core EPS guidance for 2016 to reflect the impact of these 3 items I just covered, we are maintaining our revenue and cash flow guidance based on the underlying strength of our business. Greg will provide more details on that later. 
Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, second quarter revenue increased 3% to $17.5 billion on 199 deliveries. Notwithstanding overall solid core operating performance, the charges and cost reclassification led to an operating earnings loss in the quarter. Key milestones in the quarter included successfully delivering the first 12-per-month rate aircraft on the 787 program, declaring the 787-10 production-ready, opening the 777X Composite Wing Center and completing high-altitude flight testing on the 737 MAX, which continues to run ahead of schedule. 
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. Operating margins were 8.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the Tanker charge. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order for 12 CH-47 Chinooks for the Royal Netherlands Air Force and 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters for the Qatar Air Force.
In summary, notwithstanding the accounting charges and the cost reclassification in the quarter, we had solid underlying operating performance, achieved critical program milestones and returned significant cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. We recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook. And based on solid traffic growth and continued replacement demand, we now forecast nearly $6 trillion of demand for 39,620 commercial airplanes, an increase of nearly 1,600 from last year. 
Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year-to-date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish, with year-to-date freight traffic down approximately 1%. We continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced, with particular attention being paid to the widebody segment. 
While oil prices have meaningfully rebounded from lows earlier this year, our customers continue to tell us that movements in oil prices have not substantially changed their view on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. As always, we see isolated pockets of market softness, such as Russia and Brazil; however, we will continue to manage our skylines to maintain production schedules and health. 
New order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace, as indicated by the flow of announcements at Farnborough Airshow. As a result of the compelling and enduring value proposition of our airplanes, requests to change deliveries are holding well below the historical average. Over the past 12 months, deferrals, accelerations debookings and cancellations remain at about 1% of backlog. We continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to ramp up beyond 900 aircraft per year through the end of this decade, driven by ongoing market demand and our sizable and diverse backlog. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remains strong for the 737, with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. We remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 per month to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57-per-month rate, we continue to be oversold. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. While long-term demand remains strong, we have seen some hesitation in near-term demand in recent months varying by program. For the current generation 777, our backlog as of the end of quarter stood at 175 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 8 net new 7 -- excuse me, we have added 8 net new 777 orders and commitments. For the full year, we are targeting approximately 40 orders as we focus on ensuring a smooth profitable transition to the 777X production. Our 777 delivery slots are completely sold out for 2016 and more than 80% sold out for 2017.
For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of the 777X test aircraft, we are nearly 60% sold out at the lower planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month. We are working an active customer pipeline to fill the remaining 2017 and 2018 delivery slots, but we clearly have more work to do over the next few months to hold the current 777 production plans. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high and the development of this next game-changing widebody remains on track. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of more than 700 orders remains the foundation behind our production rate plans. As we discussed at our investor conference, securing additional orders to solidify our end-of-the-decade 14-per-month production rate plan remains a priority. As always, aligning supply and demand to maximize profitability will guide our decisions on 777 and 787 production plans. 
On the 747 program I mentioned earlier, air cargo market headwinds continue to pressure demand and pricing. So far this year, we have captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to build the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market remains challenging. We will continue to monitor it closely while aggressively driving productivity and cost reduction to win additional orders. 
On the commercial services side. We continue to deliver on our strategy to grow this element of our business. We recently announced agreements with 6 airlines from around the world to provide advanced analytics solutions to increase their efficiency in operating over 500 airplanes. Furthermore, in the largest commercial airplane services deal in Boeing history, Norwegian committed through 2034 to GoldCare coverage for both its 737 MAX fleet and to expanded coverage of the airline's entire 787 Dreamliner fleet.
Our significant global scale and depth, intimate aircraft knowledge and our substantial installed base combine to provide a meaningful opportunity to continue growing our services and support business, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrades business, as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services. Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and the 787-10. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. Domestically, the president's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the second quarter, international customers represented 29% of BDS revenue, 37% of the current backlog.
The strength of our Defense and Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation and affordability as well as leveraging our One Boeing advantage. We continue to focus on areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. We're investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities in technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer; JSTARS Recapitalization; MQ-25A, formerly known as UCLASS; advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. We're also encouraged by the domestic and international opportunities for our proven, affordable and highly capable fighter aircraft. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets. Our teams are focused on innovation and growth and on delivering solid operating performance. We remain confident about our position in future prospects. Our focus is on accelerating our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements through the implementation of Lean, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second-century design in manufacturing initiatives. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased to $24.8 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries and solid Defense revenue. Core earnings per share was a loss of $0.44, impacted by the previously announced $3.23 of charges and cost reclassification. Notwithstanding these impacts, the core business performance was solid in the quarter. 
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. In the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17.5 billion on 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin in the quarter were impacted by the  $2.8 billion related to the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. Results were also impacted by higher planned R&D spending as we ramp up on the 777X program. Excluding the charges and the cost reclassification, BCA operating margins were a solid 10.3%. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $11 billion of net orders during the second quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $417 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, again equating to 7 years of production. 787 deferred production declined by $1 billion in the quarter driven by the cost reclassification, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $27.7 billion. When normalizing for the cost reclassification, deferred was better than planned at an increase of just $33 million.
As we previously discussed, recovering the 787 deferred production over the remainder of the decade will be a significant driver of cash flows. Our confidence in this recovery and the cash generation comes from the shifting of the delivery mix from -9s and -10s, improved pricing over the remaining 900 aircraft and supplier step-down pricing as well as internal productivity. We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning to the 12-per-month rate, increasing deliveries of the 787-9, reducing production flow times and lowering unit cost, while introducing the 787-10 into the production system. 
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue on our Defense business was $7.2 billion and operating margins was 8.3%, largely driven by the strong performance that was offset by the BDS $219 million pretax Tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft second quarter revenue was $3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and Chinook deliveries. Operating margins of 5.9% reflect the impact, again, of the Tanker charge.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.8 billion, operating margins of 8.5%, reflecting the timing of ULA launches. Global Services & Support revenue increased 12% to $2.4 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment. Operating margins were 11.1%, reflecting program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $55 billion, with now 37% of that business from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to the next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the second quarter was primarily driven by solid operating performance. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $691 million in dividends and repurchased 15 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchase to 44 million shares for a total of $5.5 billion, as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders.  Furthermore, this reflects the ongoing confidence and the long-term outlook of our markets and our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $8.5 billion repurchase authorization over the approximately next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us. 
Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is lowered by $2.05 a share to now be between $6.10 and $6.30, reflecting the second quarter charges and cost reclassification totaling $3.23 that was more than offset by improved core operating performance and tax benefits. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results as we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and efficient deployment, at the same time taking appropriate actions to derisk our business going forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

Just good solid performance across the programs. On the deferred, I'd say the profile of the deferred remains intact with what we've talked about. Again, as we focused on unit cost, day-by-day, airplane-by-airplane improvement and getting that model mix up with more -9s, and now the introduction of the -10, it's all about cash. And so how are we improving the overall cash flow of that program? Teams are doing a great job. We got certainly lots of work in front of us. But I think when you're out in the factories today, you'll see some very, very good momentum and very good focus on overall productivity initiatives that are also obviously going to help that cash profile going forward.

But ultimately, we want to get those to top quartile standards. And there's no reason why we shouldn't. And frankly, a lot of our supply chain is already there. And then -- and again, finally, on the inventory, we're looking at all aspects of the inventory across the programs. Flow time on 787 is a great example of that, and we're going to continue that focus. So I wouldn't view it as anything special or different. Is there enhanced focus on those elements to cash flow? There certainly is. But that's the objective. Certainly, get to industry standards. And then beyond that, as Dennis has talked about, what is top quartile or global industrial champion look like?

And then just as a question, we talk about services, but I think it really means kind of aftermarket more broadly, and that includes spares and parts. And so what part does that play in the strategy? And is there investment required there to either qualify new parts yourself or to incentivize alternative suppliers to qualify new parts? Is that going to be meaningful at some point? And would it have only an impact on sort of new platforms going forward? Or could it have an impact on existing and production platforms?"

Our proprietary parts business and what I'll call the traditional parts and modifications businesses that leverage our OEM knowledge base. It also includes a more significant investment in data analytics and information-based services. And you can see some of the progress on that front. I mentioned a couple in my opening comments. But more broadly, we now have, for example, 60 airlines enrolled in subscription contracts for Boeing maintenance and engineering work. It covers about 2,200 aircraft. We have another 84 customers, with about 3,800 aircraft that are benefiting from our airplane health management services. And we still see a lot of runway ahead of us in these data analytics and information-based services agreements, where we can add value for customers and also add value for Boeing. And this includes increased focus from our senior executive team on growing services, investments both inside Boeing and with our supply chain, as you pointed out.

And as I said, in 2017, we've already announced we're going to 7-per-month production rate. We're 80% sold out against that production rate. In 2018, as we introduce the 777X into the line, we'll build test aircraft. As we've announced before, the effective delivery rate in 2018 will drop to 5.5 per month, and we're 60% sold out against that profile. So we know exactly where we're at today. Now the fact is, year-to-date, we've got net orders for 8 777s against a target of approximately 40. So clearly, we have work to do yet over the next few months to fill out that orders book. And we're working hard in a number of key campaigns. Ray and his team are out with our customers, and we are aggressively working that every day. We do see that the value proposition of the airplane is holding up. But the widebody market is clearly a challenging place right now. So we've got work to do to find those additional orders. Now in the case of -- if those orders don't materialize, we're going to continue to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure that we keep supply and demand in balance. That's the key to our future. And we're going to make sure we make a profitable and efficient transition to the 777X. So we're going to continue to work those campaigns hard. We're going to work to fill out the production plans as we currently have laid them out, while being mindful of keeping supply and demand in balance. Now all of this -- I think it's important to take a step back from all of this to look at our overall plans over the next 5 years. Regardless how that scenario plays out on 777, this is a growing business where we're going to be delivering north of 900 airplanes a year by the end of the decade. And we see this as a year-over-year cash growth business, spanning all of those scenarios that we're talking about. So we're going to do the right thing here, keep widebody supply and demand in balance, make sure we have the right transition to 777X. And I think it's also worth reminding that, in the long term, the widebody marketplace is still an attractive marketplace. And as you get out into the 2020s, there's a large replacement cycle that's very clear to us. So this is about efficient transition of the 777X, and the 777X is the right airplane for the future, all within the context of a compelling growth story and year-over-year cash growth."

And that's a tough, challenging target, but I think the right one for this business for the long term, and it will drive the right behaviors and investments for the future. And achieving those kinds of margins spans all of our internal and external work. So it includes our internal productivity work, the relentless focus on Capturing the Value of Quality and our Lean+ efforts, includes our Development Program Excellence initiatives, all the things we're doing to drive internal productivity to incrementally pick up margins. Things like block extensions on our programs are accretive to margins in general as well. And as I mentioned earlier, as we grow the services business, that also tends to be accretive to margins. In parallel with that internal work, we're also working with our supply chain. Partnering for Success is a key element of this. And while we've made a lot of advancements on that front, we still have a lot of work to do across our supply chain, and we'll continue to be relentless there as well.

And what time frame would we expect to see those costs, -9 cost, become similar on a unit basis to -8?

As you know, that's an end of the decade implementation. But if you were to assume holding 12, it pushes that deferred curve out about 6 months. So not a significant impact. When you look at -8 and -9, you saw it when you're out here, the -- I'd say the design improvements that we're taking off the 8 and put on to the 9, now that we're, I'll say, ramping up -- we're right about 10 a month right now on the -9, we are really seeing those come together in the factory. And so unit cost now is about in line with -- on -9 versus -8. So the team, again, has been a great job. Lots of work in front of us. But the fact is, over 125 units -- and are now at the same level of -8, I think gives you a good sense of the design for manufacturing implementation that's taking place on that airplane. And listen, there's still a lot of ideas in the hopper. Some of those will mature. Some of them won't. But they're not slowing down. And Mark Jenks and his team are doing a terrific job looking for more opportunities. Disruption from 9 to 10, I think you said it. It is not as big of an impact certainly as it is from the 8 to the 9. That was by design. So that's in the production system today. So we certainly have provision for some longer flow times on those initial -10 units. Similar, I'll say, methodology that we did from the 8 to 9. But we're again -- I think as far as producing that airplane and the risk associated with that, it's a very different risk profile than it was from the 8 to the 9.

I won't be specific to individual customers as we have a number of discussions ongoing, but we have opportunities to accelerate into the first half of the year. And what you should read through that is that the MAX development program is going very well and running on cost and ahead of schedule. We've got all 4 test aircraft in the air, more than 300 hours on the airplanes, and the performance is looking solid and the development program is clean. And more broadly, to get to your underlying question, I think this is a good example of how we can and should perform coming out of our Development Program Excellence initiative. And this about understanding the statement. We're clearly upfront, managing that statement work, keeping it balanced, doing the right systems engineering work, working with our supply chain. This is about disciplined innovation. And we're going to bring a product to the market place that has a great value add for our customers and do it in a way that's disciplined and on cost and schedule. And that formula that we've put in place now with our Development Program Excellence initiative, we know it works. And we've taken the lessons learned from MAX. And we're cross-deploying those now into programs like the 787-10, the 777X and into our future defense development programs. And our objective here is very clear, and that is to have disciplined, effective development programs that perform on cost and schedule, that allows us to do reliable R&D planning and allows us to make best use of our innovation investments. So it's a good signpost for us, Howard. I think clearly a step in the right direction. And we're going to deleverage lessons learned from MAX across the whole enterprise. Greg, you want to hit the second part?"

Certainly, not all of it is implemented. So I wouldn't run with any of it. But that's the framework, and that's the operating around it. But it's all about how do we compete in the marketplace, no matter what marketplace we're in across the portfolio, how do we generate cash in order to invest in our future as we have, and then at the -- and then deliver value to shareholders. So those are kind of the, I'll say, the framework that's around the approach. But it goes back to my comment about no rock left unturned. So whether it's functional costs that are supporting a program or program-specific, everybody has an affordability target. And again, different levels of maturity. Some are making more progress than others, but the focus and the operating rhythm is all around that."

As we announced, the decision we made here takes into consideration a sluggish cargo market and our projections for future production rates. And the decision, in essence, that we made was to maintain our current production rate of half an airplane per month that we're implementing this year and to extend that out into the future, rather than assuming we'd ramp back up to one a month in 2019. That's the fundamental assumption change here and it reflects what we see in the cargo market. Now we still see a cargo or freighter aircraft replacement cycle out in that 2019, 2020 time frame. We have a number of ongoing customer discussions in the cargo marketplace in addition to the 2 Air Force One airplanes that you've referenced. So a number of very viable campaigns underway to fill to that half-a-month production rate. That said, we still have our work cut out for us. Cargo is a tough market right now. I will say that the decisions we've made on 747 are going to put that program in a much more solid footing for the future. It's aligned with the marketplace. As noted, we also wrote off any remaining deferred production inventory, so we've significantly derisked that program from a financial standpoint for the future.

These are important partners. But hey, we got to face into the environment that we're in and be efficient across the board.

We're not going to be driven to just get market share for market shares' sake. I will say, in the widebody marketplace, even though we're seeing some hesitation in buying, the value proposition of our airplanes is holding up well. So this is all about a look ahead to efficiently managing our production skyline and keeping supply and demand in balance. And clearly, we've got more work to do on the widebody front, while narrowbody orders are trending to be very healthy and continuing to be healthy this year. So that's our headset.

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Our second quarter financial results included both the continued solid underlying operating execution and strong cash flow performance of our commercial and defense businesses, and a substantial impact to earnings from decisions we made on the 787 and 747 programs and increased investment needed on the KC-46 Tanker program. I'll come back to explain each of those items in a moment, but let me say upfront that we're confident that the decisions we made on the 787 cost reclassification and 747 production were the right proactive ones to reduce future financial risk and strengthen our position and focus going forward. 
The added investment on Tanker, while not insignificant, enabled the completion of important testing, while sustaining our view of the long-term multi-decade value this program will generate for our customers and our shareholders. Excluding those items, both of our businesses produced double-digit margins in the quarter and we continued to deliver on our commitments to invest in innovation while also returning cash to shareholders. 
We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% over the prior year for a payout of $691 million in the quarter. Revenue in the second quarter increased to $24.8 billion on strong commercial airplane deliveries and growth in our services business. We reported a core earnings per share loss of $0.44, reflecting continued solid operating performance across our production programs that partially offset the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. 
On the 787 program, during the quarter, we reached a decision point on whether to move forward and invest funds for the refurbishment and future sale of the 2 remaining initial flight test aircraft. We elected not to do so. And subsequently, we reclassified unit costs associated with those aircraft from program inventory to R&D expense, resulting in a noncash $847 million after-tax earnings impact. 
On the 747 program, we decided to reduce future production expectations and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market. These program assumption changes drove the $814 million after-tax charge in the quarter. These charges also include the write-down of the remaining 747 deferred production cost, which significantly derisked the program going forward. Despite the ongoing challenges of the air cargo market, we continue to see the 747 as a unique and significant value creator for our customers over the long term. 
A $393 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program reflects our assessment of the cost to address previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, including implementation of the hardware solution to resolve the refueling boom axial load issue identified during flight testing, delays in the certification process and concurrency between late-stage development testing and initial production. To the credit of our team working with the Air Force, the hardware solution to the boom issue worked as planned. With the aircraft's recent success in refueling an F-16, A-10 and C-17, we have now completed all required testing to receive the Milestone C production approval from our customer, which is expected next month. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in the remainder of the flight test program, our team is duly focused on the work ahead on meeting our commitments under the revised program schedule and providing our Air Force customer the best aerial refueling tanker ever built. 
While we were -- while we are reducing core EPS guidance for 2016 to reflect the impact of these 3 items I just covered, we are maintaining our revenue and cash flow guidance based on the underlying strength of our business. Greg will provide more details on that later. 
Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, second quarter revenue increased 3% to $17.5 billion on 199 deliveries. Notwithstanding overall solid core operating performance, the charges and cost reclassification led to an operating earnings loss in the quarter. Key milestones in the quarter included successfully delivering the first 12-per-month rate aircraft on the 787 program, declaring the 787-10 production-ready, opening the 777X Composite Wing Center and completing high-altitude flight testing on the 737 MAX, which continues to run ahead of schedule. 
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. Operating margins were 8.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the Tanker charge. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order for 12 CH-47 Chinooks for the Royal Netherlands Air Force and 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters for the Qatar Air Force.
In summary, notwithstanding the accounting charges and the cost reclassification in the quarter, we had solid underlying operating performance, achieved critical program milestones and returned significant cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. We recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook. And based on solid traffic growth and continued replacement demand, we now forecast nearly $6 trillion of demand for 39,620 commercial airplanes, an increase of nearly 1,600 from last year. 
Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year-to-date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish, with year-to-date freight traffic down approximately 1%. We continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced, with particular attention being paid to the widebody segment. 
While oil prices have meaningfully rebounded from lows earlier this year, our customers continue to tell us that movements in oil prices have not substantially changed their view on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. As always, we see isolated pockets of market softness, such as Russia and Brazil; however, we will continue to manage our skylines to maintain production schedules and health. 
New order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace, as indicated by the flow of announcements at Farnborough Airshow. As a result of the compelling and enduring value proposition of our airplanes, requests to change deliveries are holding well below the historical average. Over the past 12 months, deferrals, accelerations debookings and cancellations remain at about 1% of our backlog. We continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to ramp up beyond 900 aircraft per year through the end of this decade, driven by ongoing market demand and our sizable and diverse backlog. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remains strong for the 737, with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. We remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 per month to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57-per-month rate, we continue to be oversold. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. While long-term demand remains strong, we have seen some hesitation in near-term demand in recent months varying by program. For the current generation 777, our backlog as of the end of quarter stood at 175 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 8 net new 7 -- excuse me, we have added 8 net new 777 orders and commitments. For the full year, we are targeting approximately 40 orders as we focus on ensuring a smooth profitable transition to the 777X production. Our 777 delivery slots are completely sold out for 2016 and more than 80% sold out for 2017.
For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of the 777X test aircraft, we are nearly 60% sold out at the lower planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month. We are working an active customer pipeline to fill the remaining 2017 and 2018 delivery slots, but we clearly have more work to do over the next few months to hold the current 777 production plans. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high and the development of this next game-changing widebody remains on track. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of more than 700 orders remains the foundation behind our production rate plans. As we discussed at our investor conference, securing additional orders to solidify our end-of-the-decade 14-per-month production rate plan remains a priority. As always, aligning supply and demand to maximize profitability will guide our decisions on 777 and 787 production plans. 
On the 747 program I mentioned earlier, air cargo market headwinds continue to pressure demand and pricing. So far this year, we have captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to build the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market remains challenging. We will continue to monitor it closely while aggressively driving productivity and cost reduction to win additional orders. 
On the commercial services side. We continue to deliver on our strategy to grow this element of our business. We recently announced agreements with 6 airlines from around the world to provide advanced analytics solutions to increase their efficiency in operating over 500 airplanes. Furthermore, in the largest commercial airplane services deal in Boeing's history, Norwegian committed through 2034 to GoldCare coverage for both its 737 MAX fleet and to expanded coverage of the airline's entire 787 Dreamliner fleet.
Our significant global scale and depth, intimate aircraft knowledge and our substantial installed base combine to provide a meaningful opportunity to continue growing our services and support business, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrades business, as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services. Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and the 787-10. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. Domestically, the president's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the second quarter, international customers represented 29% of BDS revenue, 37% of the current backlog.
The strength of our Defense and Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation and affordability as well as leveraging our One Boeing advantage. We continue to focus on areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. We're investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities in technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer; JSTARS Recapitalization; MQ-25A, formerly known as UCLASS; advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. We're also encouraged by the domestic and international opportunities for our proven, affordable and highly capable fighter aircraft. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets. Our teams are focused on innovation and growth and on delivering solid operating performance. We remain confident about our position in future prospects. Our focus is on accelerating our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements through the implementation of Lean, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second-century design and manufacturing initiatives. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Core earnings per sha",742,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. 
Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased to $24.8 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries and solid Defense revenue. Core earnings per share was a loss of $0.44, impacted by the previously announced $3.23 of charges and cost reclassification. Notwithstanding these impacts, the core business performance was solid in the quarter. 
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. In the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17.5 billion on 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin in the quarter were impacted by the $2.8 billion related to the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. Results were also impacted by higher planned R&D spending as we ramp up on the 777X program. Excluding the charges and the cost reclassification, BCA operating margins were a solid 10.3%. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $11 billion of net orders during the second quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $417 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, again equating to 7 years of production. 787 deferred production declined by $1 billion in the quarter driven by the cost reclassification, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $27.7 billion. When normalizing for the cost reclassification, deferred was better than planned at an increase of just $33 million.
As we previously discussed, recovering the 787 deferred production over the remainder of the decade will be a significant driver of cash flows. Our confidence in this recovery and the cash generation comes from the shifting of the delivery mix from more -9s and -10s, improved pricing over the remaining 900 aircraft and supplier step-down pricing as well as internal productivity. We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning to the 12-per-month rate, increasing deliveries of the 787-9, reducing production flow times and lowering unit cost, while introducing the 787-10 into the production system. 
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue on our Defense business was $7.2 billion and operating margins was 8.3%, largely driven by the strong performance that was offset by the BDS $219 million pretax Tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft second quarter revenue was $3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and Chinook deliveries. Operating margins of 5.9% reflect the impact, again, of the Tanker charge.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.8 billion, operating margins of 8.5%, reflecting the timing of ULA launches. Global Services & Support revenue increased 12% to $2.4 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment. Operating margins were 11.1%, reflecting program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $55 billion, with now 37% of that business from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to the next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the second quarter was primarily driven by solid operating performance. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $691 million in dividends and repurchased 15 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchase to 44 million shares for a total of $5.5 billion, as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects the ongoing confidence on the long-term outlook of our markets and our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $8.5 billion repurchase authorization over the approximately next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us. 
Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is lowered by $2.05 a share to now be between $6.10 and $6.30, reflecting the second quarter charges and cost reclassification totaling $3.23 that was more than offset by improved core operating performance and tax benefits. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results as we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and efficient deployment, at the same time taking appropriate actions to derisk our business going forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

Just good solid performance across the programs. On the deferred, I'd say the profile of the deferred remains intact with what we've talked about. Again, as we focus on unit cost, day-by-day, airplane-by-airplane improvement and getting that model mix up with more -9s, and now the introduction of the -10, it's all about cash. And so how are we improving the overall cash flow of that program? Teams are doing a great job. We got certainly lots of work in front of us. But I think when you're out in the factories today, you'll see some very, very good momentum and very good focus on overall productivity initiatives that are also obviously going to help that cash profile going forward.

But ultimately, we want to get those to top quartile standards. And there's no reason why we shouldn't. And frankly, a lot of our supply chain is already there. And then -- and again, finally, on the inventory, we're looking at all aspects of the inventory across the programs. Flow time on 787 is a great example of that, and we're going to continue that focus. So I wouldn't view it as anything special or different. Is there enhanced focus on those elements to cash flow? There certainly is. But that's the objective. Certainly, get to industry standards. And then beyond that, as Dennis has talked about, what is top quartile or global industrial champion look like?

It also includes a more significant investment in data analytics and information-based services. And you can see some of the progress on that front. I mentioned a couple in my opening comments. But more broadly, we now have, for example, 60 airlines enrolled in subscription contracts for Boeing maintenance and engineering work. It covers about 2,200 aircraft. We have another 84 customers, with about 3,800 aircraft that are benefiting from our airplane health management services. And we still see a lot of runway ahead of us in these data analytics and information-based services agreements, where we can add value for customers and also add value for Boeing.

As we've announced before, the effective delivery rate in 2018 will drop to 5.5 per month, and we're 60% sold out against that profile. So we know exactly where we're at today. Now the fact is, year-to-date, we've got net orders for 8 777s against a target of approximately 40. So clearly, we have work to do yet over the next few months to fill out that orders book. And we're working hard in a number of key campaigns. Ray and his team are out with our customers, and we are aggressively working that every day. We do see that the value proposition of the airplane is holding up. But the widebody market is clearly a challenging place right now. So we've got work to do to find those additional orders. Now in the case of -- if those orders don't materialize, we're going to continue to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure that we keep supply and demand in balance. That's the key to our future. And we're going to make sure we make a profitable and efficient transition to the 777X. So we're going to continue to work those campaigns hard. We're going to work to fill out the production plans as we currently have laid them out, while being mindful of keeping supply and demand in balance. Now all of this -- I think it's important to take a step back from all of this to look at our overall plans over the next 5 years, regardless how that scenario plays out on 777, this is a growing business where we're going to be delivering north of 900 airplanes a year by the end of the decade. And we see this as a year-over-year cash growth business, spanning all of those scenarios that we're talking about. So we're going to do the right thing here, keep widebody supply and demand in balance, make sure we have the right transition to 777X. And I think it's also worth reminding that, in the long term, the widebody marketplace is still an attractive marketplace. And as you get out into the 2020s, there's a large replacement cycle that's very clear to us. So this is about efficient transition of the 777X, and the 777X is the right airplane for the future, all within the context of a compelling growth story and year-over-year cash growth."

And pleased with the performance this past quarter, but we know we still have work to do to make that sustainable. And then in the longer term, towards the end of the decade, headed towards that mid-teen margin aspiration. And that's a tough, challenging target, but I think the right one for this business for the long term, and it will drive the right behaviors and investments for the future. And achieving those kinds of margins spans all of our internal and external work. So it includes our internal productivity work, the relentless focus on Capturing the Value of Quality and our Lean+ efforts, includes our Development Program Excellence initiatives, all the things we're doing to drive internal productivity to incrementally pick up margins. Things like block extensions on our programs are accretive to margins in general as well. And as I mentioned earlier, as we grow the services business, that also tends to be accretive to margins. In parallel with that internal work, we're also working with our supply chain. Partnering for Success is a key element of this. And while we've made a lot of advancements on that front, we still have a lot of work to do across our supply chain, and we'll continue to be relentless there as well. But think of this as a portfolio of effort all headed in the same direction. Greg, do you want to add anything to that?"

Second, if on the 787, you've talked about the advantage of a -9, you've got better pricing and that costs ultimately can come down to be comparable to the -8. And what time frame would we expect to see those costs, -9 cost, become similar on a unit basis to -8? And the third one of these is, on the 787-10, what kind of disruption would we expect given the high degree of commonality between the -9 and the when it goes into service?

If you looked at -- obviously, we're not at point of making any different rate decisions or assumptions than what we got in place. But as Dennis said, we got work to do to fill out to the 14. As you know, that's an end of the decade implementation. But if you were to assume holding 12, it pushes that deferred curve out about 6 months. So not a significant impact. When you look at -8 and -9, you saw it when you were out here, the -- I'd say the design improvements that we're taking off the -8 and put on to the -9, now that we're, I'll say, ramping up -- we're right about 10 a month right now on the -9, we are really seeing those come together in the factory. And so unit cost now is about in line with -- on -9 versus -8. So the team, again, has been a great job. Lots of work in front of us. But the fact is, over 125 units in there now at the same level of -8, I think gives you a good sense of the design for manufacturing implementation that's taking place on that airplane. And listen, there's still a lot of ideas in the hopper. Some of those will mature. Some of them won't. But they're not slowing down. And Mark Jenks and his team are doing a terrific job looking for more opportunities. Disruption from -9 to -10, I think you said it. It is not as big of an impact certainly as it is from the -8 to the -9. That was by design. So that's in the production system today. So we certainly have provision for some longer flow times on those initial -10 units. Similar, I'll say, methodology that we did from the -8 to the -9. But we're again -- I think as far as producing that airplane and the risk associated with that, it's a very different risk profile than it was from the -8 to the -9. So again, a big credit to the team on really focused on commonality in the production system to minimize that disruption as we entered into the production system."

One is, what are we going to do -- what are you doing with the benefit of this acceleration and improved process? And how much of it's being used to either accelerate deliveries or do other things with the MAX? And then also, you commented on G&A being better. And I suspect it's probably due to, I'll call it, the 787 performance hitting some of the standards that you've aspired to. So could you maybe put it together in an answer that sort of talks about some of the other things you're doing to outside of just production to make The Boeing Company and its customer better?"

On the MAX, as you've noted, we have the opportunity to accelerate EIS. We had originally planned third quarter of '17, and we now have publicly talked about that as first half of '17. I won't be specific to individual customers as we have a number of discussions ongoing, but we have opportunities to accelerate into the first half of the year. And what you should read through that is that the MAX development program is going very well and they're running on cost and ahead of schedule. We've got all 4 test aircraft in the air, more than 300 hours on the airplanes, and the performance is looking solid and the development program is clean. And more broadly, to get to your underlying question, I think this is a good example of how we can and should perform coming out of our Development Program Excellence initiative. And this about understanding the statement. We're clearly upfront, managing that statement work, keeping it balanced, doing the right systems engineering work, working with our supply chain. This is about disciplined innovation. And we're going to bring a product to the market place that has a great value add for our customers and do it in a way that's disciplined and on cost and schedule. And that formula that we've put in place now with our Development Program Excellence initiative, we know it works. And we've taken the lessons learned from MAX. And we're cross-deploying those now into programs like the 787-10, the 777X and into our future defense development programs. And our objective here is very clear, and that is to have disciplined, effective development programs that perform on cost and schedule, that allows us to do reliable R&D planning and allows us to make best use of our innovation investments. So it's a good signpost for us, Howard. I think clearly a step in the right direction. And we're going to deleverage lessons learned from MAX across the whole enterprise. Greg, you want to hit the second part?"

Certainly, not all of it is implemented. So I wouldn't run with any of it. But that's the framework, and that's the operating around it. But it's all about how do we compete in the marketplace, no matter what marketplace we're in across the portfolio; how do we generate cash in order to invest in our future as we have and then at the -- and then deliver value to shareholders. So those are kind of the, I'll say, the framework that's around the approach. But it goes back to my comment about no rock left unturned. So whether it's functional costs that are supporting a program or program-specific, everybody has an affordability target. And again, different levels of maturity. Some are making more progress than others, but the focus and the operating rhythm is all around that."

As we announced, the decision we made here, it takes into consideration a sluggish cargo market and our projections for future production rates. And the decision, in essence, that we made was to maintain our current production rate of 0.5 airplane per month that we're implementing this year and to extend that out into the future, rather than assuming we'd ramp back up to 1 a month in 2019. That's the fundamental assumption change here and it reflects what we see in the cargo market. Now we still see a cargo or freighter aircraft replacement cycle out in that 2019, 2020 time frame. We have a number of ongoing customer discussions in the cargo marketplace in addition to the 2 Air Force One airplanes that you've referenced. So a number of very viable campaigns underway to fill to that half-a-month production rate. That said, we still have our work cut out for us. Cargo is a tough market right now. I will say that the decisions we've made on 747 are going to put that program in a much more solid footing for the future. It's aligned with the marketplace. As noted, we also wrote off any remaining deferred production inventory, so we've significantly derisked that program from a financial standpoint for the future.

We're not going to be driven to just get market share for market shares' sake. I will say, in the widebody marketplace, even though we're seeing some hesitation in buying, the value proposition of our airplanes is holding up well. So this is all about a look ahead to efficiently managing our production skyline and keeping supply and demand in balance. And clearly, we've got more work to do on the widebody front, while narrowbody orders are trending to be very healthy and continuing to be healthy this year. So that's our headset. And as normal, we do a lot of scenario planning around this and different assumptions around widebody orders and what that future skyline will look like.

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Our second quarter financial results included both the continued solid underlying operating execution and strong cash flow performance of our commercial and defense businesses, and a substantial impact to earnings from decisions we made on the 787 and 747 programs and increased investment needed on the KC-46 Tanker program. I'll come back to explain each of those items in a moment, but let me say upfront that we're confident that the decisions we made on the 787 cost reclassification and 747 production were the right proactive ones to reduce future financial risk and strengthen our position and focus going forward. 
The added investment on Tanker, while not insignificant, enabled the completion of important testing, while sustaining our view of the long-term multi-decade value this program will generate for our customers and our shareholders. Excluding those items, both of our businesses produced double-digit margins in the quarter and we continued to deliver on our commitments to invest in innovation while also returning cash to shareholders. 
We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% over the prior year for a payout of $691 million in the quarter. Revenue in the second quarter increased to $24.8 billion on strong commercial airplane deliveries and growth in our services business. We reported a core earnings per share loss of $0.44, reflecting continued solid operating performance across our production programs that partially offset the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. 
On the 787 program, during the quarter, we reached a decision point on whether to move forward and invest funds for the refurbishment and future sale of the 2 remaining initial flight test aircraft. We elected not to do so. And subsequently, we reclassified unit costs associated with those aircraft from program inventory to R&D expense, resulting in a noncash $847 million after-tax earnings impact. 
On the 747 program, we decided to reduce future production expectations and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market. These program assumption changes drove the $814 million after-tax charge in the quarter. These charges also include the write-down of the remaining 747 deferred production cost, which significantly derisked the program going forward. Despite the ongoing challenges of the air cargo market, we continue to see the 747 as a unique and significant value creator for our customers over the long term. 
A $393 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program reflects our assessment of the cost to address previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, including implementation of the hardware solution to resolve the refueling boom axial load issue identified during flight testing, delays in the certification process and concurrency between late-stage development testing and initial production. To the credit of our team working with the Air Force, the hardware solution to the boom issue worked as planned. With the aircraft's recent success in refueling an F-16, A-10 and C-17, we have now completed all required testing to receive the Milestone C production approval from our customer, which is expected next month. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in the remainder of the flight test program, our team is duly focused on the work ahead on meeting our commitments under the revised program schedule and providing our Air Force customer the best aerial refueling tanker ever built. 
While we were -- while we are reducing core EPS guidance for 2016 to reflect the impact of these 3 items I just covered, we are maintaining our revenue and cash flow guidance based on the underlying strength of our business. Greg will provide more details on that later. 
Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, second quarter revenue increased 3% to $17.5 billion on 199 deliveries. Notwithstanding overall solid core operating performance, the charges and cost reclassification led to an operating earnings loss in the quarter. Key milestones in the quarter included successfully delivering the first 12-per-month rate aircraft on the 787 program, declaring the 787-10 production-ready, opening the 777X Composite Wing Center and completing high-altitude flight testing on the 737 MAX, which continues to run ahead of schedule. 
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. Operating margins were 8.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the Tanker charge. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order for 12 CH-47 Chinooks for the Royal Netherlands Air Force and 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters for the Qatar Air Force.
In summary, notwithstanding the accounting charges and the cost reclassification in the quarter, we had solid underlying operating performance, achieved critical program milestones and returned significant cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. We recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook. And based on solid traffic growth and continued replacement demand, we now forecast nearly $6 trillion of demand for 39,620 commercial airplanes, an increase of nearly 1,600 from last year. 
Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year-to-date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish, with year-to-date freight traffic down approximately 1%. We continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced, with particular attention being paid to the widebody segment. 
While oil prices have meaningfully rebounded from lows earlier this year, our customers continue to tell us that movements in oil prices have not substantially changed their view on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. As always, we see isolated pockets of market softness, such as Russia and Brazil; however, we will continue to manage our skylines to maintain production schedules and health. 
New order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace, as indicated by the flow of announcements at Farnborough Airshow. As a result of the compelling and enduring value proposition of our airplanes, requests to change deliveries are holding well below the historical average. Over the past 12 months, deferrals, accelerations debookings and cancellations remain at about 1% of our backlog. We continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to ramp up beyond 900 aircraft per year through the end of this decade, driven by ongoing market demand and our sizable and diverse backlog. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remains strong for the 737, with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. We remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 per month to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57-per-month rate, we continue to be oversold. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. While long-term demand remains strong, we have seen some hesitation in near-term demand in recent months varying by program. For the current generation 777, our backlog as of the end of quarter stood at 175 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 8 net new 7 -- excuse me, we have added 8 net new 777 orders and commitments. For the full year, we are targeting approximately 40 orders as we focus on ensuring a smooth profitable transition to the 777X production. Our 777 delivery slots are completely sold out for 2016 and more than 80% sold out for 2017.
For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of the 777X test aircraft, we are nearly 60% sold out at the lower planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month. We are working an active customer pipeline to fill the remaining 2017 and 2018 delivery slots, but we clearly have more work to do over the next few months to hold the current 777 production plans. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high and the development of this next game-changing widebody remains on track. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of more than 700 orders remains the foundation behind our production rate plans. As we discussed at our investor conference, securing additional orders to solidify our end-of-the-decade 14-per-month production rate plan remains a priority. As always, aligning supply and demand to maximize profitability will guide our decisions on 777 and 787 production plans. 
On the 747 program I mentioned earlier, air cargo market headwinds continue to pressure demand and pricing. So far this year, we have captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to build the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market remains challenging. We will continue to monitor it closely while aggressively driving productivity and cost reduction to win additional orders. 
On the commercial services side. We continue to deliver on our strategy to grow this element of our business. We recently announced agreements with 6 airlines from around the world to provide advanced analytics solutions to increase their efficiency in operating over 500 airplanes. Furthermore, in the largest commercial airplane services deal in Boeing's history, Norwegian committed through 2034 to GoldCare coverage for both its 737 MAX fleet and to expanded coverage of the airline's entire 787 Dreamliner fleet.
Our significant global scale and depth, intimate aircraft knowledge and our substantial installed base combine to provide a meaningful opportunity to continue growing our services and support business, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrades business, as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services. Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and the 787-10. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. Domestically, the president's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the second quarter, international customers represented 29% of BDS revenue, 37% of the current backlog.
The strength of our Defense and Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation and affordability as well as leveraging our One Boeing advantage. We continue to focus on areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. We're investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities in technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer; JSTARS Recapitalization; MQ-25A, formerly known as UCLASS; advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. We're also encouraged by the domestic and international opportunities for our proven, affordable and highly capable fighter aircraft. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets. Our teams are focused on innovation and growth and on delivering solid operating performance. We remain confident about our position in future prospects. Our focus is on accelerating our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements through the implementation of Lean, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second-century design and manufacturing initiatives. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased to $24.8 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries and solid Defense revenue. Core earnings per sha",742,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. 
Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased to $24.8 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries and solid Defense revenue. Core earnings per share was a loss of $0.44, impacted by the previously announced $3.23 of charges and cost reclassification. Notwithstanding these impacts, the core business performance was solid in the quarter. 
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. In the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17.5 billion on 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin in the quarter were impacted by the $2.8 billion related to the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. Results were also impacted by higher planned R&D spending as we ramp up on the 777X program. Excluding the charges and the cost reclassification, BCA operating margins were a solid 10.3%. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $11 billion of net orders during the second quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $417 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, again equating to 7 years of production. 787 deferred production declined by $1 billion in the quarter driven by the cost reclassification, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $27.7 billion. When normalizing for the cost reclassification, deferred was better than planned at an increase of just $33 million.
As we previously discussed, recovering the 787 deferred production over the remainder of the decade will be a significant driver of cash flows. Our confidence in this recovery and the cash generation comes from the shifting of the delivery mix from more -9s and -10s, improved pricing over the remaining 900 aircraft and supplier step-down pricing as well as internal productivity. We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning to the 12-per-month rate, increasing deliveries of the 787-9, reducing production flow times and lowering unit cost, while introducing the 787-10 into the production system. 
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue on our Defense business was $7.2 billion and operating margins was 8.3%, largely driven by the strong performance that was offset by the BDS $219 million pretax Tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft second quarter revenue was $3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and Chinook deliveries. Operating margins of 5.9% reflect the impact, again, of the Tanker charge.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.8 billion, operating margins of 8.5%, reflecting the timing of ULA launches. Global Services & Support revenue increased 12% to $2.4 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment. Operating margins were 11.1%, reflecting program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $55 billion, with now 37% of that business from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to the next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the second quarter was primarily driven by solid operating performance. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $691 million in dividends and repurchased 15 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchase to 44 million shares for a total of $5.5 billion, as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects the ongoing confidence on the long-term outlook of our markets and our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $8.5 billion repurchase authorization over the approximately next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us. 
Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is lowered by $2.05 a share to now be between $6.10 and $6.30, reflecting the second quarter charges and cost reclassification totaling $3.23 that was more than offset by improved core operating performance and tax benefits. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results as we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and efficient deployment, at the same time taking appropriate actions to derisk our business going forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

Our priorities are to continue building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans, and to stretch beyond those plans by sharpening and accelerating our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent attention to the profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production; continuing to strengthen our defense and space business; delivering on our development programs; driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments, innovation and growth; and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry.

Just good solid performance across the programs. On the deferred, I'd say the profile of the deferred remains intact with what we've talked about. Again, as we focus on unit cost, day-by-day, airplane-by-airplane improvement and getting that model mix up with more -9s, and now the introduction of the -10, it's all about cash. And so how are we improving the overall cash flow of that program? Teams are doing a great job. We got certainly lots of work in front of us. But I think when you're out in the factories today, you'll see some very, very good momentum and very good focus on overall productivity initiatives that are also obviously going to help that cash profile going forward.

Again, that's in line with industry practices. At the same time, we're looking at terms across all of our contracts and again looking to get those to industry standards. But ultimately, we want to get those to top quartile standards. And there's no reason why we shouldn't. And frankly, a lot of our supply chain is already there. And then -- and again, finally, on the inventory, we're looking at all aspects of the inventory across the programs. Flow time on 787 is a great example of that, and we're going to continue that focus. So I wouldn't view it as anything special or different. Is there enhanced focus on those elements to cash flow? There certainly is. But that's the objective. Certainly, get to industry standards. And then beyond that, as Dennis has talked about, what is top quartile or global industrial champion look like?

It also includes a more significant investment in data analytics and information-based services. And you can see some of the progress on that front. I mentioned a couple in my opening comments. But more broadly, we now have, for example, 60 airlines enrolled in subscription contracts for Boeing maintenance and engineering work. It covers about 2,200 aircraft. We have another 84 customers, with about 3,800 aircraft that are benefiting from our airplane health management services. And we still see a lot of runway ahead of us in these data analytics and information-based services agreements, where we can add value for customers and also add value for Boeing. And this includes an increased focus from our senior executive team on growing services, investments both inside Boeing and with our supply chain, as you pointed out.

In 2018, as we introduce the 777X into the line, we'll build test aircraft. As we've announced before, the effective delivery rate in 2018 will drop to 5.5 per month, and we're 60% sold out against that profile. So we know exactly where we're at today. Now the fact is, year-to-date, we've got net orders for 8 777s against a target of approximately 40. So clearly, we have work to do yet over the next few months to fill out that orders book. And we're working hard in a number of key campaigns. Ray and his team are out with our customers, and we are aggressively working that every day. We do see that the value proposition of the airplane is holding up. But the widebody market is clearly a challenging place right now. So we've got work to do to find those additional orders. Now in the case of -- if those orders don't materialize, we're going to continue to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure that we keep supply and demand in balance. That's the key to our future. And we're going to make sure we make a profitable and efficient transition to the 777X. So we're going to continue to work those campaigns hard. We're going to work to fill out the production plans as we currently have laid them out, while being mindful of keeping supply and demand in balance. Now all of this -- I think it's important to take a step back from all of this to look at our overall plans over the next 5 years, regardless how that scenario plays out on 777, this is a growing business where we're going to be delivering north of 900 airplanes a year by the end of the decade. And we see this as a year-over-year cash growth business, spanning all of those scenarios that we're talking about. So we're going to do the right thing here, keep widebody supply and demand in balance, make sure we have the right transition to 777X. And I think it's also worth reminding that, in the long term, the widebody marketplace is still an attractive marketplace. And as you get out into the 2020s, there's a large replacement cycle that's very clear to us. So this is about efficient transition of the 777X, and the 777X is the right airplane for the future, all within the context of a compelling growth story and year-over-year cash growth."

So it includes our internal productivity work, the relentless focus on Capturing the Value of Quality and our Lean+ efforts, includes our Development Program Excellence initiatives, all the things we're doing to drive internal productivity to incrementally pick up margins. Things like block extensions on our programs are accretive to margins in general as well. And as I mentioned earlier, as we grow the services business, that also tends to be accretive to margins. In parallel with that internal work, we're also working with our supply chain. Partnering for Success is a key element of this. And while we've made a lot of advancements on that front, we still have a lot of work to do across our supply chain, and we'll continue to be relentless there as well.

Second, if on the 787, you've talked about the advantage of a -9, you've got better pricing and that costs ultimately can come down to be comparable to the -8. And what time frame would we expect to see those costs, -9 cost, become similar on a unit basis to -8? And the third one of these is, on the 787-10, what kind of disruption would we expect given the high degree of commonality between the -9 and the when it goes into service?

If you looked at -- obviously, we're not at point of making any different rate decisions or assumptions than what we got in place. But as Dennis said, we got work to do to fill out to the 14. As you know, that's an end of the decade implementation. But if you were to assume holding 12, it pushes that deferred curve out about 6 months. So not a significant impact. When you look at -8 and -9, you saw it when you were out here, the -- I'd say the design improvements that we're taking off the -8 and put on to the -9, now that we're, I'll say, ramping up -- we're right about 10 a month right now on the -9, we are really seeing those come together in the factory. And so unit cost now is about in line with -- on -9 versus -8. So the team, again, has been a great job. Lots of work in front of us. But the fact is, over 125 units in there now at the same level of -8, I think gives you a good sense of the design for manufacturing implementation that's taking place on that airplane. And listen, there's still a lot of ideas in the hopper. Some of those will mature. Some of them won't. But they're not slowing down. And Mark Jenks and his team are doing a terrific job looking for more opportunities. Disruption from -9 to -10, I think you said it. It is not as big of an impact certainly as it is from the -8 to the -9. That was by design. So that's in the production system today. So we certainly have provision for some longer flow times on those initial -10 units. Similar, I'll say, methodology that we did from the -8 to the -9. But we're again -- I think as far as producing that airplane and the risk associated with that, it's a very different risk profile than it was from the -8 to the -9. So again, a big credit to the team on really focused on commonality in the production system to minimize that disruption as we entered into the production system."

I won't be specific to individual customers as we have a number of discussions ongoing, but we have opportunities to accelerate into the first half of the year. And what you should read through that is that the MAX development program is going very well and they're running on cost and ahead of schedule. We've got all 4 test aircraft in the air, more than 300 hours on the airplanes, and the performance is looking solid and the development program is clean.

And this about understanding the statement. We're clearly upfront, managing that statement work, keeping it balanced, doing the right systems engineering work, working with our supply chain. This is about disciplined innovation.

So those are kind of the, I'll say, the framework that's around the approach. But it goes back to my comment about no rock left unturned.

As we announced, the decision we made here, it takes into consideration a sluggish cargo market and our projections for future production rates. And the decision, in essence, that we made was to maintain our current production rate of 0.5 airplane per month that we're implementing this year and to extend that out into the future, rather than assuming we'd ramp back up to 1 a month in 2019. That's the fundamental assumption change here and it reflects what we see in the cargo market. Now we still see a cargo or freighter aircraft replacement cycle out in that 2019, 2020 time frame. We have a number of ongoing customer discussions in the cargo marketplace in addition to the 2 Air Force One airplanes that you've referenced. So a number of very viable campaigns underway to fill to that half-a-month production rate. That said, we still have our work cut out for us. Cargo is a tough market right now. I will say that the decisions we've made on 747 are going to put that program in a much more solid footing for the future. It's aligned with the marketplace. As noted, we also wrote off any remaining deferred production inventory, so we've significantly derisked that program from a financial standpoint for the future. And we're going to continue to work to fill out the skyline."

And again, we don't get too encumbered with the exact timing of those orders. And it's very clear that this year's order cycle is more favorable on the narrowbodies. And so if you're looking at numbers of aircraft, we expect the predominance of that orders flow this year to be in the narrowbodies arena. That all said, we're going to continue to work hard to fill out the widebody skylines as well. We don't need to make drastic changes to pricing in order to capture market share. We're not going to be driven to just get market share for market shares' sake. I will say, in the widebody marketplace, even though we're seeing some hesitation in buying, the value proposition of our airplanes is holding up well. So this is all about a look ahead to efficiently managing our production skyline and keeping supply and demand in balance. And clearly, we've got more work to do on the widebody front, while narrowbody orders are trending to be very healthy and continuing to be healthy this year. So that's our headset. And as normal, we do a lot of scenario planning around this and different assumptions around widebody orders and what that future skyline will look like. And as you heard earlier, our commitment is to make the decisions that allow us to make the transition on the 777 efficient and productive. And we will do that."

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Our second quarter financial results included both the continued solid underlying operating execution and strong cash flow performance of our commercial and defense businesses, and a substantial impact to earnings from decisions we made on the 787 and 747 programs and increased investment needed on the KC-46 Tanker program. I'll come back to explain each of those items in a moment, but let me say upfront that we're confident that the decisions we made on the 787 cost reclassification and 747 production were the right proactive ones to reduce future financial risk and strengthen our position and focus going forward. 
The added investment on Tanker, while not insignificant, enabled the completion of important testing, while sustaining our view of the long-term multi-decade value this program will generate for our customers and our shareholders. Excluding those items, both of our businesses produced double-digit margins in the quarter and we continued to deliver on our commitments to invest in innovation while also returning cash to shareholders. 
We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% over the prior year for a payout of $691 million in the quarter. Revenue in the second quarter increased to $24.8 billion on strong commercial airplane deliveries and growth in our services business. We reported a core earnings per share loss of $0.44, reflecting continued solid operating performance across our production programs that partially offset the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. 
On the 787 program, during the quarter, we reached a decision point on whether to move forward and invest funds for the refurbishment and future sale of the 2 remaining initial flight test aircraft. We elected not to do so. And subsequently, we reclassified unit costs associated with those aircraft from program inventory to R&D expense, resulting in a noncash $847 million after-tax earnings impact. 
On the 747 program, we decided to reduce future production expectations and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market. These program assumption changes drove the $814 million after-tax charge in the quarter. These charges also include the write-down of the remaining 747 deferred production cost, which significantly derisked the program going forward. Despite the ongoing challenges of the air cargo market, we continue to see the 747 as a unique and significant value creator for our customers over the long term. 
A $393 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program reflects our assessment of the cost to address previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, including implementation of the hardware solution to resolve the refueling boom axial load issue identified during flight testing, delays in the certification process and concurrency between late-stage development testing and initial production. To the credit of our team working with the Air Force, the hardware solution to the boom issue worked as planned. With the aircraft's recent success in refueling an F-16, A-10 and C-17, we have now completed all required testing to receive the Milestone C production approval from our customer, which is expected next month. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in the remainder of the flight test program, our team is duly focused on the work ahead on meeting our commitments under the revised program schedule and providing our Air Force customer the best aerial refueling tanker ever built. 
While we were -- while we are reducing core EPS guidance for 2016 to reflect the impact of these 3 items I just covered, we are maintaining our revenue and cash flow guidance based on the underlying strength of our business. Greg will provide more details on that later. 
Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, second quarter revenue increased 3% to $17.5 billion on 199 deliveries. Notwithstanding overall solid core operating performance, the charges and cost reclassification led to an operating earnings loss in the quarter. Key milestones in the quarter included successfully delivering the first 12-per-month rate aircraft on the 787 program, declaring the 787-10 production-ready, opening the 777X Composite Wing Center and completing high-altitude flight testing on the 737 MAX, which continues to run ahead of schedule. 
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. Operating margins were 8.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the Tanker charge. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order for 12 CH-47 Chinooks for the Royal Netherlands Air Force and 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters for the Qatar Air Force.
In summary, notwithstanding the accounting charges and the cost reclassification in the quarter, we had solid underlying operating performance, achieved critical program milestones and returned significant cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. We recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook. And based on solid traffic growth and continued replacement demand, we now forecast nearly $6 trillion of demand for 39,620 commercial airplanes, an increase of nearly 1,600 from last year. 
Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year-to-date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish, with year-to-date freight traffic down approximately 1%. We continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced, with particular attention being paid to the widebody segment. 
While oil prices have meaningfully rebounded from lows earlier this year, our customers continue to tell us that movements in oil prices have not substantially changed their view on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. As always, we see isolated pockets of market softness, such as Russia and Brazil; however, we will continue to manage our skylines to maintain production schedules and health. 
New order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace, as indicated by the flow of announcements at Farnborough Airshow. As a result of the compelling and enduring value proposition of our airplanes, requests to change deliveries are holding well below the historical average. Over the past 12 months, deferrals, accelerations debookings and cancellations remain at about 1% of our backlog. We continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to ramp up beyond 900 aircraft per year through the end of this decade, driven by ongoing market demand and our sizable and diverse backlog. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remains strong for the 737, with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. We remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 per month to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57-per-month rate, we continue to be oversold. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. While long-term demand remains strong, we have seen some hesitation in near-term demand in recent months varying by program. For the current generation 777, our backlog as of the end of quarter stood at 175 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 8 net new 7 -- excuse me, we have added 8 net new 777 orders and commitments. For the full year, we are targeting approximately 40 orders as we focus on ensuring a smooth profitable transition to the 777X production. Our 777 delivery slots are completely sold out for 2016 and more than 80% sold out for 2017.
For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of the 777X test aircraft, we are nearly 60% sold out at the lower planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month. We are working an active customer pipeline to fill the remaining 2017 and 2018 delivery slots, but we clearly have more work to do over the next few months to hold the current 777 production plans. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high and the development of this next game-changing widebody remains on track. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of more than 700 orders remains the foundation behind our production rate plans. As we discussed at our investor conference, securing additional orders to solidify our end-of-the-decade 14-per-month production rate plan remains a priority. As always, aligning supply and demand to maximize profitability will guide our decisions on 777 and 787 production plans. 
On the 747 program I mentioned earlier, air cargo market headwinds continue to pressure demand and pricing. So far this year, we have captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to build the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market remains challenging. We will continue to monitor it closely while aggressively driving productivity and cost reduction to win additional orders. 
On the commercial services side. We continue to deliver on our strategy to grow this element of our business. We recently announced agreements with 6 airlines from around the world to provide advanced analytics solutions to increase their efficiency in operating over 500 airplanes. Furthermore, in the largest commercial airplane services deal in Boeing's history, Norwegian committed through 2034 to GoldCare coverage for both its 737 MAX fleet and to expanded coverage of the airline's entire 787 Dreamliner fleet.
Our significant global scale and depth, intimate aircraft knowledge and our substantial installed base combine to provide a meaningful opportunity to continue growing our services and support business, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrades business as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services. Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and the 787-10. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. Domestically, the president's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the second quarter, international customers represented 29% of BDS revenue, 37% of the current backlog.
The strength of our Defense and Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation and affordability as well as leveraging our One Boeing advantage. We continue to focus on areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. We're investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities in technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer; JSTARS Recapitalization; MQ-25A, formerly known as UCLASS; advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. We're also encouraged by the domestic and international opportunities for our proven, affordable and highly capable fighter aircraft. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets. Our teams are focused on innovation and growth and on delivering solid operating performance. We remain confident about our position in future prospects. Our focus is on accelerating our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements through the implementation of Lean, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second-century design and manufacturing initiatives. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased to $24.8 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries and solid Defense revenue. Core earnings per share was a loss of $0.44, impacted by the previously announced $3.23 of charges and cost reclassification. Notwithstanding these impacts, the core business performance was solid in the quarter. 
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. In the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17.5 billion on 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin in the quarter were impacted by the $2.8 billion related to the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. Results were also impacted by higher planned R&D spending as we ramp up on the 777X program. Excluding the charges and the cost reclassification, BCA operating margins were a solid 10.3%. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $11 billion of net orders during the second quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $417 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, again equating to 7 years of production. 787 deferred production declined by $1 billion in the quarter driven by the cost reclassification, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $27.7 billion. When normalizing for the cost reclassification, deferred was better than planned at an increase of just $33 million.
As we previously discussed, recovering the 787 deferred production over the remainder of the decade will be a significant driver of cash flows. Our confidence in this recovery and the cash generation comes from the shifting of the delivery mix from more -9s and -10s, improved pricing over the remaining 900 aircraft and supplier step-down pricing as well as internal productivity. We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning to the 12-per-month rate, increasing deliveries of the 787-9, reducing production flow times and lowering unit cost, while introducing the 787-10 into the production system. 
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue on our Defense business was $7.2 billion and operating margins was 8.3%, largely driven by the strong performance that was offset by the BDS $219 million pretax Tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft second quarter revenue was $3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and Chinook deliveries. Operating margins of 5.9% reflect the impact, again, of the Tanker charge.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.8 billion, operating margins of 8.5%, reflecting the timing of ULA launches. Global Services & Support revenue increased 12% to $2.4 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment. Operating margins were 11.1%, reflecting program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $55 billion, with now 37% of that business from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to the next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the second quarter was primarily driven by solid operating performance. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $691 million in dividends and repurchased 15 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchase to 44 million shares for a total of $5.5 billion, as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects the ongoing confidence on the long-term outlook of our markets and our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $8.5 billion repurchase authorization over the approximately next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us. 
Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is lowered by $2.05 a share to now be between $6.10 and $6.30, reflecting the second quarter charges and cost reclassification totaling $3.23 that was more than offset by improved core operating performance and tax benefits. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results as we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and efficient deployment, at the same time taking appropriate actions to derisk our business going forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

As we move into the second half of 2016 and begin Boeing's second century in operation, we know we cannot stand still if we are to further our industry leadership and honor the rich legacy of generations of talented, hard-working people that built this company. Our teams remain intensely focused on growth, disciplined execution, quality and productivity improvement and meeting our customer commitments. 
Our priorities are to continue building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans, and to stretch beyond those plans by sharpening and accelerating our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent attention to the profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production; continuing to strengthen our defense and space business; delivering on our development programs; driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments, innovation and growth; and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry. All of which is to position Boeing for the next 100 years and continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and to create increasing value for our customers, our shareholders, our employees and other stakeholders. 
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

Just good solid performance across the programs. On the deferred, I'd say the profile of the deferred remains intact with what we've talked about. Again, as we focus on unit cost, day-by-day, airplane-by-airplane improvement and getting that model mix up with more -9s, and now the introduction of the -10, it's all about cash. And so how are we improving the overall cash flow of that program? Teams are doing a great job. We got certainly lots of work in front of us. But I think when you're out in the factories today, you'll see some very, very good momentum and very good focus on overall productivity initiatives that are also obviously going to help that cash profile going forward. So the fundamentals, as far as the cash flow story on 787, remain intact."

Again, that's in line with industry practices. At the same time, we're looking at terms across all of our contracts and again looking to get those to industry standards. But ultimately, we want to get those to top quartile standards. And there's no reason why we shouldn't. And frankly, a lot of our supply chain is already there. And then -- and again, finally, on the inventory, we're looking at all aspects of the inventory across the programs. Flow time on 787 is a great example of that, and we're going to continue that focus. So I wouldn't view it as anything special or different. Is there enhanced focus on those elements to cash flow? There certainly is. But that's the objective. Certainly, get to industry standards. And then beyond that, as Dennis has talked about, what is top quartile or global industrial champion look like?

It also includes a more significant investment in data analytics and information-based services. And you can see some of the progress on that front. I mentioned a couple in my opening comments. But more broadly, we now have, for example, 60 airlines enrolled in subscription contracts for Boeing maintenance and engineering work. It covers about 2,200 aircraft. We have another 84 customers, with about 3,800 aircraft that are benefiting from our airplane health management services. And we still see a lot of runway ahead of us in these data analytics and information-based services agreements, where we can add value for customers and also add value for Boeing. And this includes an increased focus from our senior executive team on growing services, investments both inside Boeing and with our supply chain, as you pointed out.

And as I said, in 2017, we've already announced we're going to 7-per-month production rate. We're 80% sold out against that production rate. In 2018, as we introduce the 777X into the line, we'll build test aircraft. As we've announced before, the effective delivery rate in 2018 will drop to 5.5 per month, and we're 60% sold out against that profile. So we know exactly where we're at today. Now the fact is, year-to-date, we've got net orders for 8 777s against a target of approximately 40. So clearly, we have work to do yet over the next few months to fill out that orders book. And we're working hard in a number of key campaigns. Ray and his team are out with our customers, and we are aggressively working that every day. We do see that the value proposition of the airplane is holding up. But the widebody market is clearly a challenging place right now. So we've got work to do to find those additional orders. Now in the case of -- if those orders don't materialize, we're going to continue to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure that we keep supply and demand in balance. That's the key to our future. And we're going to make sure we make a profitable and efficient transition to the 777X. So we're going to continue to work those campaigns hard. We're going to work to fill out the production plans as we currently have laid them out, while being mindful of keeping supply and demand in balance. Now all of this -- I think it's important to take a step back from all of this to look at our overall plans over the next 5 years, regardless how that scenario plays out on 777, this is a growing business where we're going to be delivering north of 900 airplanes a year by the end of the decade. And we see this as a year-over-year cash growth business, spanning all of those scenarios that we're talking about. So we're going to do the right thing here, keep widebody supply and demand in balance, make sure we have the right transition to 777X. And I think it's also worth reminding that, in the long term, the widebody marketplace is still an attractive marketplace. And as you get out into the 2020s, there's a large replacement cycle that's very clear to us. So this is about efficient transition of the 777X, and the 777X is the right airplane for the future, all within the context of a compelling growth story and year-over-year cash growth."

So it includes our internal productivity work, the relentless focus on Capturing the Value of Quality and our Lean+ efforts, includes our Development Program Excellence initiatives, all the things we're doing to drive internal productivity to incrementally pick up margins. Things like block extensions on our programs are accretive to margins in general as well. And as I mentioned earlier, as we grow the services business, that also tends to be accretive to margins. In parallel with that internal work, we're also working with our supply chain. Partnering for Success is a key element of this. And while we've made a lot of advancements on that front, we still have a lot of work to do across our supply chain, and we'll continue to be relentless there as well.

And so unit cost now is about in line with -- on -9 versus -8. So the team, again, has been a great job. Lots of work in front of us. But the fact is, over 125 units in there now at the same level of -8, I think gives you a good sense of the design for manufacturing implementation that's taking place on that airplane. And listen, there's still a lot of ideas in the hopper. Some of those will mature. Some of them won't. But they're not slowing down. And Mark Jenks and his team are doing a terrific job looking for more opportunities. Disruption from -9 to -10, I think you said it. It is not as big of an impact certainly as it is from the -8 to the -9. That was by design. So that's in the production system today. So we certainly have provision for some longer flow times on those initial -10 units. Similar, I'll say, methodology that we did from the -8 to the -9. But we're again -- I think as far as producing that airplane and the risk associated with that, it's a very different risk profile than it was from the -8 to the -9. So again, a big credit to the team on really focused on commonality in the production system to minimize that disruption as we entered into the production system."

I won't be specific to individual customers as we have a number of discussions ongoing, but we have opportunities to accelerate into the first half of the year. And what you should read through that is that the MAX development program is going very well and they're running on cost and ahead of schedule. We've got all 4 test aircraft in the air, more than 300 hours on the airplanes, and the performance is looking solid and the development program is clean. And more broadly, to get to your underlying question, I think this is a good example of how we can and should perform coming out of our Development Program Excellence initiative. And this about understanding the statement. We're clearly upfront, managing that statement work, keeping it balanced, doing the right systems engineering work, working with our supply chain. This is about disciplined innovation. And we're going to bring a product to the market place that has a great value add for our customers and do it in a way that's disciplined and on cost and schedule. And that formula that we've put in place now with our Development Program Excellence initiative, we know it works. And we've taken the lessons learned from MAX. And we're cross-deploying those now into programs like the 787-10, the 777X and into our future defense development programs. And our objective here is very clear, and that is to have disciplined, effective development programs that perform on cost and schedule, that allows us to do reliable R&D planning and allows us to make best use of our innovation investments. So it's a good signpost for us, Howard. I think clearly a step in the right direction. And we're going to deleverage lessons learned from MAX across the whole enterprise.

Certainly, not all of it is implemented. So I wouldn't run with any of it. But that's the framework, and that's the operating around it. But it's all about how do we compete in the marketplace, no matter what marketplace we're in across the portfolio; how do we generate cash in order to invest in our future as we have and then at the -- and then deliver value to shareholders. So those are kind of the, I'll say, the framework that's around the approach. But it goes back to my comment about no rock left unturned. So whether it's functional costs that are supporting a program or program-specific, everybody has an affordability target. And again, different levels of maturity.

That's the fundamental assumption change here and it reflects what we see in the cargo market. Now we still see a cargo or freighter aircraft replacement cycle out in that 2019, 2020 time frame. We have a number of ongoing customer discussions in the cargo marketplace in addition to the 2 Air Force One airplanes that you've referenced.

And so it all starts with market-based affordability and then how does that impact your business. When we -- as I indicated, when it comes to working capital, we're looking at where we are on different measures around working capital and where everybody else is in this industry. And certainly, the 2 suppliers you called out are great suppliers to us, and we've been working with them over the last year on transitioning to a more, I'll say, industry standard around payments. And we were paying daily millions of transactions. And we're paying daily, that's not an industry standard. We're going to twice a month. And then we're looking at terms again to be competitive, manage our working capital efficiently and allowing us to invest in our future that, ultimately, everybody will benefit from, from our customers down to our suppliers. These are important partners. But hey, we got to face into the environment that we're in and be efficient across the board. And as you know, under Partnering for Success, this is also us reaching back into the supply chain, taking best practices that we have encountered in other parts of our business or supply chain and sharing those with the supply chain to ultimately make them better. So I'd say it's across the board. And again, it's all about being market-based and facing into those realities. And meet -- and frankly, in this case, just getting the industry standards."

And again, we don't get too encumbered with the exact timing of those orders. And it's very clear that this year's order cycle is more favorable on the narrowbodies. And so if you're looking at numbers of aircraft, we expect the predominance of that orders flow this year to be in the narrowbodies arena. That all said, we're going to continue to work hard to fill out the widebody skylines as well. We don't need to make drastic changes to pricing in order to capture market share. We're not going to be driven to just get market share for market shares' sake. I will say, in the widebody marketplace, even though we're seeing some hesitation in buying, the value proposition of our airplanes is holding up well. So this is all about a look ahead to efficiently managing our production skyline and keeping supply and demand in balance. And clearly, we've got more work to do on the widebody front, while narrowbody orders are trending to be very healthy and continuing to be healthy this year. So that's our headset. And as normal, we do a lot of scenario planning around this and different assumptions around widebody orders and what that future skyline will look like. And as you heard earlier, our commitment is to make the decisions that allow us to make the transition on the 777 efficient and productive. And we will do that."

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. 
Now let's move to Slide 2. Our second quarter financial results included both the continued solid underlying operating execution and strong cash flow performance of our commercial and defense businesses, and a substantial impact to earnings from decisions we made on the 787 and 747 programs and increased investment needed on the KC-46 Tanker program. I'll come back to explain each of those items in a moment, but let me say upfront that we're confident that the decisions we made on the 787 cost reclassification and 747 production were the right proactive ones to reduce future financial risk and strengthen our position and focus going forward. 
The added investment on Tanker, while not insignificant, enabled the completion of important testing, while sustaining our view of the long-term multi-decade value this program will generate for our customers and our shareholders. Excluding those items, both of our businesses produced double-digit margins in the quarter and we continued to deliver on our commitments to invest in innovation while also returning cash to shareholders. 
We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and increased our dividend per share 20% over the prior year for a payout of $691 million in the quarter. Revenue in the second quarter increased to $24.8 billion on strong commercial airplane deliveries and growth in our services business. We reported a core earnings per share loss of $0.44, reflecting continued solid operating performance across our production programs that partially offset the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. 
On the 787 program, during the quarter, we reached a decision point on whether to move forward and invest funds for the refurbishment and future sale of the 2 remaining initial flight test aircraft. We elected not to do so. And subsequently, we reclassified unit costs associated with those aircraft from program inventory to R&D expense, resulting in a noncash $847 million after-tax earnings impact. 
On the 747 program, we decided to reduce future production expectations and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market. These program assumption changes drove the $814 million after-tax charge in the quarter. These charges also include the write-down of the remaining 747 deferred production cost, which significantly derisked the program going forward. Despite the ongoing challenges of the air cargo market, we continue to see the 747 as a unique and significant value creator for our customers over the long term. 
A $393 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program reflects our assessment of the cost to address previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, including implementation of the hardware solution to resolve the refueling boom axial load issue identified during flight testing, delays in the certification process and concurrency between late-stage development testing and initial production. To the credit of our team working with the Air Force, the hardware solution to the boom issue worked as planned. With the aircraft's recent success in refueling an F-16, A-10 and C-17, we have now completed all required testing to receive the Milestone C production approval from our customer, which is expected next month. 
Recognizing the risks inherent in the remainder of the flight test program, our team is duly focused on the work ahead on meeting our commitments under the revised program schedule and providing our Air Force customer the best aerial refueling tanker ever built. 
While we were -- while we are reducing core EPS guidance for 2016 to reflect the impact of these 3 items I just covered, we are maintaining our revenue and cash flow guidance based on the underlying strength of our business. Greg will provide more details on that later. 
Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, second quarter revenue increased 3% to $17.5 billion on 199 deliveries. Notwithstanding overall solid core operating performance, the charges and cost reclassification led to an operating earnings loss in the quarter. Key milestones in the quarter included successfully delivering the first 12-per-month rate aircraft on the 787 program, declaring the 787-10 production-ready, opening the 777X Composite Wing Center and completing high-altitude flight testing on the 737 MAX, which continues to run ahead of schedule. 
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. Operating margins were 8.3%, reflecting strong performance, offset by a portion of the Tanker charge. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order for 12 CH-47 Chinooks for the Royal Netherlands Air Force and 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters for the Qatar Air Force.
In summary, notwithstanding the accounting charges and the cost reclassification in the quarter, we had solid underlying operating performance, achieved critical program milestones and returned significant cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. We recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook. And based on solid traffic growth and continued replacement demand, we now forecast nearly $6 trillion of demand for 39,620 commercial airplanes, an increase of nearly 1,600 from last year. 
Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year-to-date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish, with year-to-date freight traffic down approximately 1%. We continue to keep a watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand are balanced, with particular attention being paid to the widebody segment. 
While oil prices have meaningfully rebounded from lows earlier this year, our customers continue to tell us that movements in oil prices have not substantially changed their view on future fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. As always, we see isolated pockets of market softness, such as Russia and Brazil; however, we will continue to manage our skylines to maintain production schedules and health. 
New order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace, as indicated by the flow of announcements at Farnborough Airshow. As a result of the compelling and enduring value proposition of our airplanes, requests to change deliveries are holding well below the historical average. Over the past 12 months, deferrals, accelerations debookings and cancellations remain at about 1% of our backlog. We continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to ramp up beyond 900 aircraft per year through the end of this decade, driven by ongoing market demand and our sizable and diverse backlog. 
Turning to individual airplane programs. Demand remains strong for the 737, with a robust backlog of nearly 4,400 firm orders. We remain on track to raise 737 production from the current 42 per month to 47 in 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57-per-month rate, we continue to be oversold. 
Turning to the twin-aisle market. While long-term demand remains strong, we have seen some hesitation in near-term demand in recent months varying by program. For the current generation 777, our backlog as of the end of quarter stood at 175 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 8 net new 7 -- excuse me, we have added 8 net new 777 orders and commitments. For the full year, we are targeting approximately 40 orders as we focus on ensuring a smooth profitable transition to the 777X production. Our 777 delivery slots are completely sold out for 2016 and more than 80% sold out for 2017.
For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of the 777X test aircraft, we are nearly 60% sold out at the lower planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month. We are working an active customer pipeline to fill the remaining 2017 and 2018 delivery slots, but we clearly have more work to do over the next few months to hold the current 777 production plans. With a strong foundation of 306 orders from 6 customers, interest and demand in our new 777X remains high and the development of this next game-changing widebody remains on track. 
On the 787 program. Our backlog of more than 700 orders remains the foundation behind our production rate plans. As we discussed at our investor conference, securing additional orders to solidify our end-of-the-decade 14-per-month production rate plan remains a priority. As always, aligning supply and demand to maximize profitability will guide our decisions on 777 and 787 production plans. 
On the 747 program I mentioned earlier, air cargo market headwinds continue to pressure demand and pricing. So far this year, we have captured 4 747-8 freighter orders and continue to work a number of sales campaigns to build the 747 production skyline. That said, this segment of the market remains challenging. We will continue to monitor it closely while aggressively driving productivity and cost reduction to win additional orders. 
On the commercial services side. We continue to deliver on our strategy to grow this element of our business. We recently announced agreements with 6 airlines from around the world to provide advanced analytics solutions to increase their efficiency in operating over 500 airplanes. Furthermore, in the largest commercial airplane services deal in Boeing's history, Norwegian committed through 2034 to GoldCare coverage for both its 737 MAX fleet and to expanded coverage of the airline's entire 787 Dreamliner fleet.
Our significant global scale and depth, intimate aircraft knowledge and our substantial installed base combine to provide a meaningful opportunity to continue growing our services and support business, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrades business, as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services. Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive as we continue to execute on our robust backlog, smoothly transition 737 production to the MAX and complete development of the 777X and the 787-10. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. Domestically, the president's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key BDS programs, and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. During the second quarter, international customers represented 29% of BDS revenue, 37% of the current backlog.
The strength of our Defense and Space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services, our investments in innovation and affordability as well as leveraging our One Boeing advantage. We continue to focus on areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. We're investing in future franchise programs and leveraging capabilities in technologies across the enterprise for the T-X trainer; JSTARS Recapitalization; MQ-25A, formerly known as UCLASS; advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. We're also encouraged by the domestic and international opportunities for our proven, affordable and highly capable fighter aircraft. 
In summary, our plans and strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets. Our teams are focused on innovation and growth and on delivering solid operating performance. We remain confident about our position in future prospects. Our focus is on accelerating our efforts to drive quality, safety, productivity and organizational improvements through the implementation of Lean, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second-century design and manufacturing initiatives. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Core earnings per sha",742,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. 
Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased to $24.8 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries and solid Defense revenue. Core earnings per share was a loss of $0.44, impacted by the previously announced $3.23 of charges and cost reclassification. Notwithstanding these impacts, the core business performance was solid in the quarter. 
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. In the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17.5 billion on 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin in the quarter were impacted by the $2.8 billion related to the 787 cost reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. Results were also impacted by higher planned R&D spending as we ramp up on the 777X program. Excluding the charges and the cost reclassification, BCA operating margins were a solid 10.3%. 
Commercial Airplanes captured $11 billion of net orders during the second quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $417 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, again equating to 7 years of production. 787 deferred production declined by $1 billion in the quarter driven by the cost reclassification, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $27.7 billion. When normalizing for the cost reclassification, deferred was better than planned at an increase of just $33 million.
As we previously discussed, recovering the 787 deferred production over the remainder of the decade will be a significant driver of cash flows. Our confidence in this recovery and the cash generation comes from the shifting of the delivery mix from more -9s and -10s, improved pricing over the remaining 900 aircraft and supplier step-down pricing as well as internal productivity. We continue to make progress on the 787 program, including successfully transitioning to the 12-per-month rate, increasing deliveries of the 787-9, reducing production flow times and lowering unit cost, while introducing the 787-10 into the production system. 
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue on our Defense business was $7.2 billion and operating margins was 8.3%, largely driven by the strong performance that was offset by the BDS $219 million pretax Tanker charge. Boeing Military Aircraft second quarter revenue was $3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and Chinook deliveries. Operating margins of 5.9% reflect the impact, again, of the Tanker charge.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.8 billion, operating margins of 8.5%, reflecting the timing of ULA launches. Global Services & Support revenue increased 12% to $2.4 billion, reflecting higher volume and aircraft modernization and sustainment. Operating margins were 11.1%, reflecting program mix. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $55 billion, with now 37% of that business from customers outside the United States. 
Let's move to the next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the second quarter was primarily driven by solid operating performance. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $691 million in dividends and repurchased 15 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchase to 44 million shares for a total of $5.5 billion, as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects the ongoing confidence on the long-term outlook of our markets and our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $8.5 billion repurchase authorization over the approximately next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains top priority for us. 
Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is lowered by $2.05 a share to now be between $6.10 and $6.30, reflecting the second quarter charges and cost reclassification totaling $3.23 that was more than offset by improved core operating performance and tax benefits. The core operating engine continues to deliver strong results as we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation and efficient deployment, at the same time taking appropriate actions to derisk our business going forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

Just good solid performance across the programs. On the deferred, I'd say the profile of the deferred remains intact with what we've talked about. Again, as we focus on unit cost, day-by-day, airplane-by-airplane improvement and getting that model mix up with more -9s, and now the introduction of the -10, it's all about cash. And so how are we improving the overall cash flow of that program? Teams are doing a great job. We got certainly lots of work in front of us.

I wanted to talk a little bit about working capital and apply that to cash. There's been a lot of chatter out there in the media, even amongst some of your suppliers that have hosted earnings calls this quarter, about a lengthening payable cycle at Boeing. So I was wondering if you could just chat a little bit about your strategy there, how long it's been in place, how much more we have to go, and tie that to the sustainability of cash flows. Are we getting a onetime bump this year? Or have you been working on this for a while and it's been masked?

I mean, Jason, I'd say this is just back to fundamentals around working capital, how we're collecting, how we're paying and then ultimately how we're managing our inventory. And we've got initiatives in place for each. When it comes to payables, we have changed our frequency of pay, that we've gone from daily to twice a month. Again, that's in line with industry practices. At the same time, we're looking at terms across all of our contracts and again looking to get those to industry standards. But ultimately, we want to get those to top quartile standards. And there's no reason why we shouldn't. And frankly, a lot of our supply chain is already there. And then -- and again, finally, on the inventory, we're looking at all aspects of the inventory across the programs. Flow time on 787 is a great example of that, and we're going to continue that focus. So I wouldn't view it as anything special or different. Is there enhanced focus on those elements to cash flow? There certainly is. But that's the objective. Certainly, get to industry standards. And then beyond that, as Dennis has talked about, what is top quartile or global industrial champion look like? And there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to get to those levels of efficiency."

It also includes a more significant investment in data analytics and information-based services. And you can see some of the progress on that front. I mentioned a couple in my opening comments. But more broadly, we now have, for example, 60 airlines enrolled in subscription contracts for Boeing maintenance and engineering work. It covers about 2,200 aircraft. We have another 84 customers, with about 3,800 aircraft that are benefiting from our airplane health management services. And we still see a lot of runway ahead of us in these data analytics and information-based services agreements, where we can add value for customers and also add value for Boeing. And this includes an increased focus from our senior executive team on growing services, investments both inside Boeing and with our supply chain, as you pointed out.

And as I said, in 2017, we've already announced we're going to 7-per-month production rate. We're 80% sold out against that production rate. In 2018, as we introduce the 777X into the line, we'll build test aircraft. As we've announced before, the effective delivery rate in 2018 will drop to 5.5 per month, and we're 60% sold out against that profile. So we know exactly where we're at today. Now the fact is, year-to-date, we've got net orders for 8 777s against a target of approximately 40. So clearly, we have work to do yet over the next few months to fill out that orders book. And we're working hard in a number of key campaigns. Ray and his team are out with our customers, and we are aggressively working that every day. We do see that the value proposition of the airplane is holding up. But the widebody market is clearly a challenging place right now. So we've got work to do to find those additional orders. Now in the case of -- if those orders don't materialize, we're going to continue to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure that we keep supply and demand in balance. That's the key to our future. And we're going to make sure we make a profitable and efficient transition to the 777X. So we're going to continue to work those campaigns hard. We're going to work to fill out the production plans as we currently have laid them out, while being mindful of keeping supply and demand in balance. Now all of this -- I think it's important to take a step back from all of this to look at our overall plans over the next 5 years, regardless how that scenario plays out on 777, this is a growing business where we're going to be delivering north of 900 airplanes a year by the end of the decade. And we see this as a year-over-year cash growth business, spanning all of those scenarios that we're talking about. So we're going to do the right thing here, keep widebody supply and demand in balance, make sure we have the right transition to 777X. And I think it's also worth reminding that, in the long term, the widebody marketplace is still an attractive marketplace. And as you get out into the 2020s, there's a large replacement cycle that's very clear to us. So this is about efficient transition of the 777X, and the 777X is the right airplane for the future, all within the context of a compelling growth story and year-over-year cash growth."

And achieving those kinds of margins spans all of our internal and external work. So it includes our internal productivity work, the relentless focus on Capturing the Value of Quality and our Lean+ efforts, includes our Development Program Excellence initiatives, all the things we're doing to drive internal productivity to incrementally pick up margins. Things like block extensions on our programs are accretive to margins in general as well. And as I mentioned earlier, as we grow the services business, that also tends to be accretive to margins. In parallel with that internal work, we're also working with our supply chain. Partnering for Success is a key element of this. And while we've made a lot of advancements on that front, we still have a lot of work to do across our supply chain, and we'll continue to be relentless there as well.

And what time frame would we expect to see those costs, -9 cost, become similar on a unit basis to -8?

As you know, that's an end of the decade implementation. But if you were to assume holding 12, it pushes that deferred curve out about 6 months. So not a significant impact. When you look at -8 and -9, you saw it when you were out here, the -- I'd say the design improvements that we're taking off the -8 and put on to the -9, now that we're, I'll say, ramping up -- we're right about 10 a month right now on the -9, we are really seeing those come together in the factory. And so unit cost now is about in line with -- on -9 versus -8. So the team, again, has been a great job. Lots of work in front of us. But the fact is, over 125 units in there now at the same level of -8, I think gives you a good sense of the design for manufacturing implementation that's taking place on that airplane. And listen, there's still a lot of ideas in the hopper. Some of those will mature. Some of them won't. But they're not slowing down. And Mark Jenks and his team are doing a terrific job looking for more opportunities. Disruption from -9 to -10, I think you said it. It is not as big of an impact certainly as it is from the -8 to the -9. That was by design. So that's in the production system today. So we certainly have provision for some longer flow times on those initial -10 units. Similar, I'll say, methodology that we did from the -8 to the -9. But we're again -- I think as far as producing that airplane and the risk associated with that, it's a very different risk profile than it was from the -8 to the -9.

I won't be specific to individual customers as we have a number of discussions ongoing, but we have opportunities to accelerate into the first half of the year. And what you should read through that is that the MAX development program is going very well and they're running on cost and ahead of schedule. We've got all 4 test aircraft in the air, more than 300 hours on the airplanes, and the performance is looking solid and the development program is clean. And more broadly, to get to your underlying question, I think this is a good example of how we can and should perform coming out of our Development Program Excellence initiative. And this about understanding the statement. We're clearly upfront, managing that statement work, keeping it balanced, doing the right systems engineering work, working with our supply chain. This is about disciplined innovation. And we're going to bring a product to the market place that has a great value add for our customers and do it in a way that's disciplined and on cost and schedule. And that formula that we've put in place now with our Development Program Excellence initiative, we know it works. And we've taken the lessons learned from MAX. And we're cross-deploying those now into programs like the 787-10, the 777X and into our future defense development programs. And our objective here is very clear, and that is to have disciplined, effective development programs that perform on cost and schedule, that allows us to do reliable R&D planning and allows us to make best use of our innovation investments. So it's a good signpost for us, Howard. I think clearly a step in the right direction. And we're going to deleverage lessons learned from MAX across the whole enterprise.

Certainly, not all of it is implemented. So I wouldn't run with any of it. But that's the framework, and that's the operating around it. But it's all about how do we compete in the marketplace, no matter what marketplace we're in across the portfolio; how do we generate cash in order to invest in our future as we have and then at the -- and then deliver value to shareholders. So those are kind of the, I'll say, the framework that's around the approach. But it goes back to my comment about no rock left unturned. So whether it's functional costs that are supporting a program or program-specific, everybody has an affordability target. And again, different levels of maturity.

That's the fundamental assumption change here and it reflects what we see in the cargo market. Now we still see a cargo or freighter aircraft replacement cycle out in that 2019, 2020 time frame. We have a number of ongoing customer discussions in the cargo marketplace in addition to the 2 Air Force One airplanes that you've referenced. So a number of very viable campaigns underway to fill to that half-a-month production rate. That said, we still have our work cut out for us. Cargo is a tough market right now. I will say that the decisions we've made on 747 are going to put that program in a much more solid footing for the future. It's aligned with the marketplace.

And clearly, we've got more work to do on the widebody front, while narrowbody orders are trending to be very healthy and continuing to be healthy this year. So that's our headset.

My comments today will focus on our third quarter results and our business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details and provide you a glimpse into 2017.
With that, let's move to Slide 2. Our third quarter financial results reflect continued solid performance at both businesses and strong operating cash flow. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash and repurchased $1 billion of Boeing stock during the quarter, as we continue to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders while investing in innovation and our future growth. Through the first 3 quarters, we repurchased 51 million shares totaling $6.5 billion.
Revenue in the third quarter was $23.9 billion, reflecting slightly lower planned delivery volume as well as continued growth in both commercial and defense services. We reported core earnings per share of $3.51 on continued overall solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes third quarter revenue was $17 billion on 188 deliveries with a segment operating margin of 9.4%. Key milestones in the quarter included completing testing to ensure the 737 MAX 8 is ready to enter service and starting 737 MAX 9 production. Furthermore, in October, we began 787-10 midbody integration, and we rolled out of the factory our 500th 787 Dreamliner.
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, third quarter revenue was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, reflecting solid performance on production and services programs, offset by the Commercial Crew charge. Key contract awards for the defense side of the business included a $2.8 billion order for 19 KC-46 Tankers for the U.S. Air Force, an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to purchase 50 Apache attack helicopters and 9 P-8A Poseidon aircraft and $1 billion award from the Defense Logistics Agency for F/A-18 spare parts.
In summary, for the quarter, we delivered solid operating results in both businesses, drove further productivity across the enterprise, captured significant contract awards and continued to return cash to shareholders.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our view of the business environment remains generally positive with solid overall demand for commercial airplanes, defense and space platforms and services and support. In the commercial market, new order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace. In particular, we're seeing strong demand for narrowbody aircraft such as the 737 MAX. In the widebody segment, we continue to see some near-term hesitation in certain regions, and the order activity has been more measured. Over the long term, however, our view remains highly positive, with our 20-year commercial market outlook projecting demand for more than 39,600 aircraft valued at $6 trillion. Specifically for the widebody market, we see demand over the next 20 years for more than 9,000 aircraft and see replacement demand starting to accelerate again early next decade, and we're well positioned with the 777X and 787 families.
We also recently updated our outlook for the commercial market in China, where we now see a $1 trillion market opportunity for more than 6,800 aircraft over the next 20 years.
The continued strength of our overall market outlook is based on solid ongoing replacement demand and traffic growth. This year, passenger traffic growth is again outpacing GDP with IATA reporting an approximately 6% increase year-to-date.
On the cargo side, the market is improved slightly, but year-to-date growth is modest at 1%. As always, we are keeping a consistent watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand remain balanced.
Despite the relative softening we've described for the widebody market, the strength and value of our offerings is illustrated by recent order activity for a total of 52 widebody planes. In October, Qatar Airways ordered 30 787-9s and 10 777-300ERs and China Southern ordered 12 787-9s.
In addition, we are pleased that the U.S. Treasury recently granted Boeing a license to sell 80 new airplanes to Iran Air, including a mix of 34 widebody planes. There's more work to do to finalize the sale, but we are encouraged by the progress.
As we have noted on a number of occasions, the timing and outcome of several ongoing widebody sales campaigns will be the determining factors in final decisions on the 777 bridge production rate. We expect to have additional clarity on 777 production decisions in the next couple of months. On the 787 program, we have more time to further assess the implementation of the next production rate increase that is currently scheduled to ramp up the 14 per month at the end of the decade.
Also, as a reminder, even if we have to moderate our widebody production plans in the future, we continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to grow beyond 900 airplanes per year through the end of this decade, supporting our expectation that we will continue to grow cash flow year-over-year throughout this time period.
Our production plan is built upon our large and diverse order backlog and underpinned by our fundamental belief in the long-term growth and replacement trends that have fueled increasing commercial airplane demand for the past several decades.
Turning to individual airplane programs. Customer demand remains strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of more than 4,300 firm orders for the NG and MAX models combined. We remain on track to raise the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 47 in the third quarter of 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold. Simply put, this is a big attractive market, and the 737 family's position within it is solid.
For the current-generation 777, our backlog now stands at more than 160 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 17 net new 777 orders. We are on track to transition to the 7 per month production rate at the start of 2017, as previously announced. At that rate and with the Qatar order I mentioned earlier, delivery slots for 777 are now about 85% sold out for 2017. For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of 777X test aircraft, we are roughly 60% sold out at the planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month.
To balance [ph] some scenarios for you on the 777, when we consider the recent order additions and our ongoing campaigns to fill the remaining delivery slots, at this time, we don't envision a situation where we would need to lower production more than 1 or 2 units per month below our current plan. If that were to occur, implementation would begin in late 2017 or early 2018. On the other end of the spectrum, should we see success on ongoing campaigns, we may not need to adjust our existing production plans at all. 
We have disciplined processes in place for making these decisions in a timely manner as campaigns are finalized. And of course, any steps we might take to further align production with demand will include the necessary adjustments to maximize profitability and ensure a smooth transition to the 777X.
For the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 306 orders that supports our production plan of ramping up deliveries in 2020 and beyond.
On the 787 program, our backlog consists of approximately 700 firm orders, which provide a solid foundation for future production.  As I alluded to before, securing additional orders to solidify the 14 per month production rate at the end of the decade remains a priority. And the recent orders for 42 aircraft from Qatar Airways and China Southern improves our position, but there's still more work to do.
On the 747 program, we are encouraged by the modest recovery in the air cargo market, and we continue to have a number of sales campaigns underway that will help to fill the production skyline.
Regarding commercial services, the market is an attractive opportunity that we are aggressively targeting by growing our services and support areas, including our traditional parts, mods [ph] and upgrade business as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services.
During the quarter, we entered into an agreement with Japan Airlines for a 10-year contract to provide spare parts under the Boeing GoldCare program. In addition, over the past few month, we won orders from Atlas Air to convert 9 767 passenger airplanes into Boeing-converted freighters.
Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive due to our market-leading product lineup, large, high-quality customer backlog and a culture that continuously drives productivity across all aspects of the enterprise.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. While the fiscal year 2017 U.S. Federal budget is not yet finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is firm, and we continue to anticipate modest defense spending growth over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. We are encouraged by the recent White House approval and the congressional notification authorizing the sale of 36 F-15s to Qatar with options for 36 more and the sale of 28 F-18s to Kuwait with options for an additional 12.
During the third quarter, international customers represented 27% of BDS revenue and 38% of the current backlog. Our team is continuing to reshape our defense business with a focus on dramatically improving our cost structure. This is further enhancing our competitive position and expanding profitability. The team has captured nearly $6 billion of operating cost savings, and we continue to target an additional $2 billion.
In addition to improving cost competitiveness and affordability, we are also focused on investing in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. Capturing future franchise programs remains a priority for us, and we're leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X Trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities, including the unmanned aircraft carrier-based MQ-25A, where we recently won a U.S. Navy contract for risk-reduction activities.
In summary, our overall business outlook is aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and we are optimistic and motivated by our future prospects. Our dedicated and talented teams across the enterprise are focused on delivering on our customer commitments while accelerating improvements in quality, safety and productivity and driving further innovation in our products and processes. We continue to generate results and identify additional opportunities through implementation of Lean Plus, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second century design and manufacturing initiatives.
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion driven by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51 as",1091,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion driven by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51 as solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments totaled $0.98, more than offset the $0.16 impact on the Commercial Crew program. The $0.28 tax adjustment for the 2011-2012 settlement was expected and already factored into our full year core EPS guidance. However, the $0.70 related to the tax-basis adjustment booked in this quarter was not reflected in our annual guidance. Just to be mindful for next year, we expect to have a more normalized corporate tax rate of approximately 31% to 32%.
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the third quarter, Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17 billion on 188 airplane deliveries. BCA reported operating margins of 9.4% driven by solid operating performance and delivery mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9 billion in net orders during the third quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $409 billion and more than 5,600 aircraft, equating to approximately 7 years of production.
On the 787 program, the deferred production balance declined by $151 million in the quarter. This decrease was driven by delivery mix, internal productivity efforts and supplier step-down pricing. Over the long term, we continue to focus on improving 787 cash generation, and again driven by favorable mix, further internal productivity improvements and, again, additional suppliers step-down pricing.
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue of our defense business was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, largely driven by strong performance at BMA and GS&S that was offset by results in Network & Space. Boeing Military Aircraft revenue was $3.3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and F-15 volume. Operating margins of 13.3% reflect solid execution across the portfolio. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion. Operating earnings were $35 million, reflecting the impact from the Commercial Crew program. As a result of delays in completion of engineering and supply chain activities of the program, we recorded $124 million reversal of cumulative pretax earnings and a $38 million pretax reach-forward loss. At our Global Services & Support business, revenue increased 17% to $2.5 billion, reflecting higher volume in Aircraft Modernization & Sustainment. Operating margins were 12.4%, reflecting strong performance in program mix.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog at $53 billion with 38% of that business coming from customers outside the United States.
Next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the third quarter was driven by solid operating performance across the enterprise. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis indicated earlier, we paid nearly $700 million in dividend and repurchased 7.6 million shares for $1 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 51 million shares for a total of $6.5 billion. Again, returning cash to shareholders, along with continuing to invest and support future growth, remain a priority for us and reflect our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.
Let's move to cash and debt balance now on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. And again, our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Let's turn now to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $500 million to now be between $93.5 billion and $95.5 billion on higher 747 and 787 commercial airplane deliveries, and guidance is increased 5 airplanes to now be between 745 and 750 deliveries for the year. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is increased by $0.70 to now be between $6.80 and $7 a share, reflecting the third quarter tax-basis adjustment. While we haven't yet finalized our plans for 2017, we'd like to give -- take a moment and provide you with some initial insight. As Dennis previously mentioned back in September, we expect 2017 to be a year -- another year of solid financial performance.
So first and foremost, our view on cash flow growth is unchanged. We continue to forecast cash flow growth in '17 and in '18 and beyond. At our current production rates, we expect higher BCA deliveries next year while revenue should be flat to slightly down, largely driven by delivery mix as we increase 737 production, implement the transition from the 777 to the 777X and begin 787-10 production. BDS revenue next year should be also flat to slightly down on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume due to milestone revenue that more than offset the higher services and tanker revenue.
Regarding operating margins, we continue to target near-term double-digit margins for both BCA and BDS. Obviously, any production rate adjustments could modestly impact near-term margin at BCA. Having said that and as we've discussed before, we have numerous productivity activities in work [ph] that we'll continue to work and look for opportunities to accelerate these best we can. Again, we continue to work several sales campaigns, which will ultimately be the deciding factor of any potential rate adjustments.
Longer term, we're aggressively driving productivity throughout the business to maximize profitability as we strive to achieve mid-teen operating margins at both BCA and BDS. These are aspirational goals, and we certainly have a lot of work to do and hard decisions in front of us. However, we believe this is the right objective and goal for us and our teams.
We're guiding -- regarding our outlook for cash flow growth next year, as expected, widebody production rate decisions can modestly affect that rate of growth. However, we still continue to see operating cash flow growing in '17 and then again '18 and beyond. Our confidence in this outlook is based on us delivering on a robust backlog; executing on our established development programs; driving additional productivity efforts; and finally, improving the cash profile on the 787 program. We have a strong foundation to grow cash flows over the remainder of the decade, and we are taking the necessary actions to derisk the business while also more efficiently executing all elements of the business.
Again, we still have some work to do to finalize our outlook for 2017. And as always, we'll provide more detail on the full year 2017 guidance on our call -- on our January earnings call.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000-plus aircraft being widebodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle. Just looking at the existing fleets, t",423,"Great question, Jason. So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000-plus aircraft being widebodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle. Just looking at the existing fleets, that starts early in the next decade, early 2020s. In particular, if we look at the 777 fleet and we look for opportunities there, we'll have a number of aircraft that will be reaching 10-year lifespan at that point in our replacement cycles. That timing is very well aligned with when we'll be ramping up and beginning to deliver the 777X. And that's been one of the things that's been fueling our focus on delivering that development program. In addition to that, that 787 is going to be very well positioned for that market. We're continuing to see market dynamics that are expanding route structures, leveraging the technology of that airplane. If you look at 787s since we've introduced it, our customers have now introduced more than 130 new city pairs based on the unique capability that the 787 brings to the marketplace. So we see strong opportunity for replacement of existing fleets. We see growth opportunities as passenger traffic continues to grow at a clip of about 6% a year. And we see growth associated with new city pairs, new routes, that are being enabled by the technology. All 3 of those fuel our prospects for the future, and we see a solid mix of both the 787 family and the 777 family feeding right into that cycle. That all said, we've got a couple of years near term in front of us here where we're working through the transition to the 777. And we're being mindful of some of the local widebody market hesitation that we're all seeing right now. We're confident that we're going to be able to work our way through that in a profitable and effective manner, transition to the 777X and then move into that replacement cycle. Strong demand signals as we get into the next decade. And through all of this, we're going to be very mindful about matching supply and demand. It's in all of our interest to make sure those stay balanced and that we take the right actions to ensure that we do things profitably and efficiently through the transition. So that's some color around it. But again, if we look at the 20-year cycle here, widebody marketplace is a strong marketplace, and it's both replacement and growth driven."

And customers that are operating in that space are giving us positive feedback on the 747-8. We see more of the growth happening in 787 and 777. And of course, we'll be ramping up 777X production nominally to the kind of production rates that we have on today's 777 line. 787 is where we're looking at that additional production step-up to 14 a month. And we'll be assessing that here over the next 6 months. So that longer-term profile will look flat to modest growth in production volume on our widebody lines overall."

And then as we talked about, we're building the 787-10 flight test airplanes. So those -- and then of course, 777 rate going down to the planned 7 a month. So those are really the bigger moving pieces as we look into '17. But certainly, tanker is part of that but not as significant as some of these items. So we're continuing to execute there, and we'll expect positive cash flow next year."

But it's not something that we just stated without an intent to pursue. We are very serious about pursuing that, and we see a path to getting there, requires a lot of hard work. Key items there will include increasing profitability on the 787 program. So if you're looking for milestones and checkpoints there, you'll see, as we burn down deferred production inventory, hopefully you saw a good sign there this quarter. As we continue to drive profitability on that line, you will see improved profitability, incremental pickups on margins in BCA. Also, additional work on Partnering for Success as we work across our supply chain. You'll see incremental improvements as we both capture agreements that are already in place or additional cost reductions in our supply chain. And we are relentless on our broader Lean Plus activities and Capturing the Value of Quality activities that get into all of our production lines. And incrementally, those will add to profitability over time. Also, making sure we execute on our development programs and cleanly finishing up on 737 MAX, which, as you know, we're expecting to deliver ahead of schedule. We're executing well on 777X, but we're very focused on ensuring we get to the finish line cleanly on those development programs. So at a very detailed level, we work that into our business plans and commitments. Our team is on board and driving execution. We're very focused on getting to double-digit margins here in the near term and achieving those mid-teen margins towards the end of the decade. So it's a very real target, very serious target, but we also acknowledge the fact that it's going to require a lot of hard work. Greg, you want to add anything?"

So combined with all the initiatives that we have in place across all aspects of the business and cost elements, at the same time, a keen eye on how do we derisk anything, as you've seen from moderating the 747 rate, development program, execution. The 737 MAX introduction, I think, is a good example of derisking, to ensure that we have long-term profitability over the portfolio. Same thing with the moves we're making on 777 transition -- the 777X. So trying to be mindful of moderating and derisking, where certainly that's been a challenge over the past. And that is also a contributor to this kind of long -- on this longer-term objective. But as Dennis said, I mean, we think it's the right objective to have in place. We don't have all the answers today, but we have some solid plans in place around the attributes or elements that Dennis indicated. Some of those, we're going to be successful. On some of them, we may not, and we'll, I'll say, retool and look for further opportunities, but we think it's the right objective for us to focus on."

Our current plan, as you know, is we're stepping down to 7 a month production rate starting 2017, carrying that through the transition. And during 2018, when we're building 777X flight test aircraft, the effective delivery rate of airplanes is 5.5 a month, as you noted. That's our current baseline plan. At that plan, we are currently 85% sold-out in 2017 and roughly 60% sold-out in 2018. And we painted a number of scenarios around that baseline for the future. And just to give you a feel for it, one of the scenarios would be to take that baseline plan and drop it by 2 aircraft a month in 2018, as you noted. And if we were to do that, with no additional sales, we're already more than 90% sold-out against that profile, that skyline in 2018. So I see that as a bounding case. Now we have a number of important campaigns still under way. We're encouraged by the positive results at the recent Qatar Airways decision. Great customer there. And that order for 10 777s was one of those significant campaigns that we've been working on. We have others that we're still working on. So as we finalize those over the next couple of months, we'll be able to finalize our decisions for the 2018 production rate. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of the bounding cases here.

Howard, great question. And I appreciate the straightforward points you made there. And yes, these fixed-price development programs have been challenging, and we've been transparent about some of the issues we've had on Tanker and Commercial Crew and confident in the recovery actions we've taken on those. But more broadly, we've learned those lessons about how to do development programs and do them in a way that still delivers breakthrough capability for our customers, but deliver them in more incremental, risk-managed steps. And I think a great example of that, you now see some of that process improvement bearing fruit in our commercial developments. 737 MAX, for example, being delivered on time, actually a little ahead of schedule and on cost. 787-10. Again, our ability to now incrementally, in a risk-managed way, bring breakthrough capability to our customers. That's part of our broader deployment of our development program excellence initiative. Part of our focus on that, and hopefully, you'll see our actions there, recently elevating positions on my direct reports Ex Co, Scott Fancher, with responsibility for Development Program Excellence with large, so that we even more so deliver on some of those initiatives across the enterprise. So I think what you see here is that we're very focused on being world-class at development programs. We've learned some tough lessons. We've addressed those. We've made some process improvements. You're seeing those beginning to pay off on programs like 737 MAX. And you can count on the factor that's going to be our focus going forward. We must be able to deliver breakthrough innovation for our customers, but deliver it in a step-wise, risk-managed way. And that's how we're going to do business going forward."

I mean, you talk about the development programs making a difference, and we've talked about that but where else can we see it so that it translates into your goals?"

When we look at development programs, a steady, consistent performance on those programs translating into a consistent R&D profile over time is important to us. So you'll see that reflect it. Whereas in the past, we might have had peaks and valleys. We have a much more consistent, steady R&D profile going forward, thinking about the portfolio development programs and clean execution. But profitability, more broadly, is driven by the other actions we've talked about, specifically 787. And now that we've turned the corner, as you saw in deferred production inventory, as an example, we are driving productivity increases on that line and just spending some time with Ray and the team down there, really making some very solid progress on driving profitability into 787. Over time, again, that will incrementally increase overall company profitability. The work on Partnering for Success, the broader application of Lean initiatives throughout our enterprise, the list of things I mentioned earlier in response to Doug's question. Those are all factors that, longer term, will drive overall enterprise profitability and create our investment capacity for the future."

So getting the 737 MAX and the full family, the 7, 8 and 9 delivered and continuing to ramp up the 787 and satisfies customers' future needs with that family. That could be the end outcome here that we simply deliver on those 2 programs as currently defined. We're also continuing to look at a potential additional stretch of the MAX. We have some very good options there that could create value for our customers. And we're marching through our assessment of that, making good progress there. That's a decision that's more in the near term. We'll work our way through. And then longer term, we're continuing to work at the so-called middle of the market airplane or options in that space, again having very productive dialogue with customer, firming up our opportunities there. If we were to go with that new airplane, that would be more in the 2024, 2025 entry into service range. On the other hand, an additional stretch of the MAX could be done more around the end of this decade, just to give you a sense for the timing there. And it's a realistic possibility that we could do both. We have the capacity and the ability to do both, and the time line and phasing of those would allow us to do both. So we're looking across that whole range of solutions. And over the next several months, we'll work through our decision process."

Let me field that first one, then Greg and I would tagteam on the second one. So first of all, in terms of customer dialogue, as we said, the overall market assessment today is a positive one, if you take a long-term view. The 20-year market and the need for 39,600 new aircraft, that's slightly up compared to last year's current market outlook. So a robust long-term market. I'd say, right now, in our customer conversations, certainly more positive in the narrowbody arena than in widebodies. As we said, there's hesitation in the widebody marketplace right now, as we think through a number of factors around the world. Slow GDP growth around the world, hesitation in cargo traffic, geopolitical questions. Yes, there are a number of factors that are causing our customers to be somewhat hesitant in widebodies in particular. So we're being mindful of that and working with our customers as we plan for the future. Narrowbodies, while again, it's all in the context of some broad global economic concern, the ordering activity and the robustness of narrowbody growth continues to be very clear, fueled by traffic growth. And as we said earlier, as we ramp up the 737 line to 57 a month, we continue to be oversold against that profile. And just as another data point, deferrals and cancellations remain at historical lows, at about 1% of backlog. And load factors and utilization rates on aircraft fleets, again, remained generally very high compared to historical averages. So that's a composite view of the marketplace. We're staying very close to our customers, making sure they get the support they need, maintaining a balanced view of the future. But there's more upside than downside in the overall marketplace, and we're going to make sure we have a balanced approach to how we run the business.

In our narrowbody marketplace, the demand signals remain very strong. As I said, traffic growth looks very positive, sustaining at about 6% a year. The fact that our market is strong, our backlog is built out, that we're oversold against the production rate ramp-up on 737 that I described earlier, that just adds strength to our supply chain in that marketplace. So whether that attracts more participation from suppliers or they are more eager to participate in a robust, growing marketplace, I think that's good for Boeing, it's good for our suppliers.

And I think, as Dennis indicated, that makes the supply chain healthier, which I think we all will benefit from. So if there is any trade-offs or any challenges they may be having around the business jet, this is a great opportunity to take some of these productivity, working capital-type initiatives and partner together and really make overall operations more efficient.

The fact that we're not waiting for the 777X production ramp-up to test out the new production automation system. We actually pulled it ahead, implemented it on the existing 777 line, to derisk it. Now that derisking process has not been completely clean. As you well know, we've had some challenges ramping it up. But our ability to pull it ahead to the existing 777 line has dramatically reduced our risk. It's allowed us to wring out the automation systems, and we've now delivered more than 20 units using that process. So that's a great example of accelerating innovation, derisking it for the future, and adds to our confidence the 777X will be delivered as planned. And now your broader comment about headcount and jobs. Of course, we're always very mindful about what we're doing on this front. We put a lot of value into our employees and our team. We've got a great team -- I'd say, the best team in the world. At the same time, we're dealing with market realities around competitiveness and challenging market environment. So we'll continue to take the right actions to make sure we're a profitable business that can invest that can invest in the future. And we're going to continue to invest in our team. But headcount variations are natural part of our business, and we're very diligent about handling those in a balanced way in a way that's very respectful of our team."

My comments today will focus on our third quarter results and our business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details and provide you a glimpse into 2017.
With that, let's move to Slide 2. Our third quarter financial results reflect continued solid performance at both businesses and strong operating cash flow. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash and repurchased $1 billion of Boeing stock during the quarter, as we continue to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders while investing in innovation and our future growth. Through the first 3 quarters, we repurchased 51 million shares totaling $6.5 billion.
Revenue in the third quarter was $23.9 billion, reflecting slightly lower planned delivery volume as well as continued growth in both commercial and defense services. We reported core earnings per share of $3.51 on continued overall solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes third quarter revenue was $17 billion on 188 deliveries with a segment operating margin of 9.4%. Key milestones in the quarter included completing testing to ensure the 737 MAX 8 is ready to enter service and starting 737 MAX 9 production. Furthermore, in October, we began 787-10 midbody integration, and we rolled out of the factory our 500th 787 Dreamliner.
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, third quarter revenue was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, reflecting solid performance on production and services programs, offset by the Commercial Crew charge. Key contract awards for the defense side of the business included a $2.8 billion order for 19 KC-46 Tankers for the U.S. Air Force, an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to purchase 50 Apache attack helicopters and 9 P-8A Poseidon aircraft and $1 billion award from the Defense Logistics Agency for F/A-18 spare parts.
In summary, for the quarter, we delivered solid operating results in both businesses, drove further productivity across the enterprise, captured significant contract awards and continued to return cash to shareholders.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our view of the business environment remains generally positive with solid overall demand for commercial airplanes, defense and space platforms and services and support. In the commercial market, new order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace. In particular, we're seeing strong demand for narrowbody aircraft such as the 737 MAX. In the widebody segment, we continue to see some near-term hesitation in certain regions, and the order activity has been more measured. Over the long term, however, our view remains highly positive, with our 20-year commercial market outlook projecting demand for more than 39,600 aircraft valued at $6 trillion. Specifically for the widebody market, we see demand over the next 20 years for more than 9,000 aircraft and see replacement demand starting to accelerate again early next decade, and we're well positioned with the 777X and 787 families.
We also recently updated our outlook for the commercial market in China, where we now see a $1 trillion market opportunity for more than 6,800 aircraft over the next 20 years.
The continued strength of our overall market outlook is based on solid ongoing replacement demand and traffic growth. This year, passenger traffic growth is again outpacing GDP with IATA reporting an approximately 6% increase year-to-date.
On the cargo side, the market is improved slightly, but year-to-date growth is modest at 1%. As always, we are keeping a consistent watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand remain balanced.
Despite the relative softening we've described for the widebody market, the strength and value of our offerings is illustrated by recent order activity for a total of 52 widebody planes. In October, Qatar Airways ordered 30 787-9s and 10 777-300ERs and China Southern ordered 12 787-9s.
In addition, we are pleased that the U.S. Treasury recently granted Boeing a license to sell 80 new airplanes to Iran Air, including a mix of 34 widebody planes. There's more work to do to finalize the sale, but we are encouraged by the progress.
As we have noted on a number of occasions, the timing and outcome of several ongoing widebody sales campaigns will be the determining factors in final decisions on the 777 bridge production rate. We expect to have additional clarity on 777 production decisions in the next couple of months. On the 787 program, we have more time to further assess the implementation of the next production rate increase that is currently scheduled to ramp up the 14 per month at the end of the decade.
Also, as a reminder, even if we have to moderate our widebody production plans in the future, we continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to grow beyond 900 airplanes per year through the end of this decade, supporting our expectation that we will continue to grow cash flow year-over-year throughout this time period.
Our production plan is built upon our large and diverse order backlog and underpinned by our fundamental belief in the long-term growth and replacement trends that have fueled increasing commercial airplane demand for the past several decades.
Turning to individual airplane programs. Customer demand remains strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of more than 4,300 firm orders for the NG and MAX models combined. We remain on track to raise the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 47 in the third quarter of 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold. Simply put, this is a big attractive market, and the 737 family's position within it is solid.
For the current-generation 777, our backlog now stands at more than 160 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 17 net new 777 orders. We are on track to transition to the 7 per month production rate at the start of 2017, as previously announced. At that rate and with the Qatar order I mentioned earlier, delivery slots for 777 are now about 85% sold out for 2017. For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of 777X test aircraft, we are roughly 60% sold out at the planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month.
To balance some scenarios for you on the 777, when we consider the recent order additions and our ongoing campaigns to fill the remaining delivery slots, at this time, we don't envision a situation where we would need to lower production more than 1 or 2 units per month below our current plan. If that were to occur, implementation would begin in late 2017 or early 2018. On the other end of the spectrum, should we see success on ongoing campaigns, we may not need to adjust our existing production plans at all. 
We have disciplined processes in place for making these decisions in a timely manner as campaigns are finalized. And of course, any steps we might take to further align production with demand will include the necessary adjustments to maximize profitability and ensure a smooth transition to the 777X.
For the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 306 orders that supports our production plan of ramping up deliveries in 2020 and beyond.
On the 787 program, our backlog consists of approximately 700 firm orders, which provide a solid foundation for future production.  As I alluded to before, securing additional orders to solidify the 14 per month production rate at the end of the decade remains a priority. And the recent orders for 42 aircraft from Qatar Airways and China Southern improves our position, but there's still more work to do.
On the 747 program, we are encouraged by the modest recovery in the air cargo market, and we continue to have a number of sales campaigns underway that will help to fill the production skyline.
Regarding commercial services, the market is an attractive opportunity that we are aggressively targeting by growing our services and support areas, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrade business as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services.
During the quarter, we entered into an agreement with Japan Airlines for a 10-year contract to provide spare parts under the Boeing GoldCare program. In addition, over the past few month, we won orders from Atlas Air to convert 9 767 passenger airplanes into Boeing-converted freighters.
Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive due to our market-leading product lineup, large, high-quality customer backlog and a culture that continuously drives productivity across all aspects of the enterprise.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. While the fiscal year 2017 U.S. Federal budget is not yet finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is firm, and we continue to anticipate modest defense spending growth over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. We are encouraged by the recent White House approval and the congressional notification authorizing the sale of 36 F-15s to Qatar with options for 36 more and the sale of 28 F-18s to Kuwait with options for an additional 12.
During the third quarter, international customers represented 27% of BDS revenue and 38% of the current backlog. Our team is continuing to reshape our defense business with a focus on dramatically improving our cost structure. This is further enhancing our competitive position and expanding profitability. The team has captured nearly $6 billion of operating cost savings, and we continue to target an additional $2 billion.
In addition to improving cost competitiveness and affordability, we are also focused on investing in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. Capturing future franchise programs remains a priority for us, and we're leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X Trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities, including the unmanned aircraft carrier-based MQ-25A, where we recently won a U.S. Navy contract for risk-reduction activities.
In summary, our overall business outlook is aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and we are optimistic and motivated by our future prospects. Our dedicated and talented teams across the enterprise are focused on delivering on our customer commitments while accelerating improvements in quality, safety and productivity and driving further innovation in our products and processes. We continue to generate results and identify additional opportunities through implementation of Lean Plus, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second century design and manufacturing initiatives.
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion driven by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51 as",1090,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion driven by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51 as solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments totaled $0.98, more than offset the $0.16 impact on the Commercial Crew program. The $0.28 tax adjustment for the 2011-2012 settlement was expected and already factored into our full year core EPS guidance. However, the $0.70 related to the tax-basis adjustment booked in this quarter was not reflected in our annual guidance. Just to be mindful for next year, we expect to have a more normalized corporate tax rate of approximately 31% to 32%.
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the third quarter, Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17 billion on 188 airplane deliveries. BCA reported operating margins of 9.4% driven by solid operating performance and delivery mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9 billion in net orders during the third quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $409 billion and more than 5,600 aircraft, equating to approximately 7 years of production.
On the 787 program, the deferred production balance declined by $151 million in the quarter. This decrease was driven by delivery mix, internal productivity efforts and supplier step-down pricing. Over the long term, we continue to focus on improving 787 cash generation, and again driven by favorable mix, further internal productivity improvements and, again, additional suppliers step-down pricing.
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue of our defense business was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, largely driven by strong performance at BMA and GS&S that was offset by results in Network & Space. Boeing Military Aircraft revenue was $3.3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and F-15 volume. Operating margins of 13.3% reflect solid execution across the portfolio. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion. Operating earnings were $35 million, reflecting the impact from the Commercial Crew program. As a result of delays in completion of engineering and supply chain activities of the program, we recorded $124 million reversal of cumulative pretax earnings and a $38 million pretax reach-forward loss. At our Global Services & Support business, revenue increased 17% to $2.5 billion, reflecting higher volume in Aircraft Modernization & Sustainment. Operating margins were 12.4%, reflecting strong performance in program mix.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog at $53 billion with 38% of that business coming from customers outside the United States.
Next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the third quarter was driven by solid operating performance across the enterprise. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis indicated earlier, we paid nearly $700 million in dividend and repurchased 7.6 million shares for $1 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 51 million shares for a total of $6.5 billion. Again, returning cash to shareholders, along with continuing to invest and support future growth, remain a priority for us and reflect our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.
Let's move to cash and debt balance now on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. And again, our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Let's turn now to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $500 million to now be between $93.5 billion and $95.5 billion on higher 747 and 787 commercial airplane deliveries, and guidance is increased 5 airplanes to now be between 745 and 750 deliveries for the year. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is increased by $0.70 to now be between $6.80 and $7 a share, reflecting the third quarter tax-basis adjustment. While we haven't yet finalized our plans for 2017, we'd like to give -- take a moment and provide you with some initial insight. As Dennis previously mentioned back in September, we expect 2017 to be a year -- another year of solid financial performance.
So first and foremost, our view on cash flow growth is unchanged. We continue to forecast cash flow growth in '17 and in '18 and beyond. At our current production rates, we expect higher BCA deliveries next year while revenue should be flat to slightly down, largely driven by delivery mix as we increase 737 production, implement the transition from the 777 to the 777X and begin 787-10 production. BDS revenue next year should be also flat to slightly down on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume due to milestone revenue that more than offset the higher services and tanker revenue.
Regarding operating margins, we continue to target near-term double-digit margins for both BCA and BDS. Obviously, any production rate adjustments could modestly impact near-term margin at BCA. Having said that and as we've discussed before, we have numerous productivity activities in work that we'll continue to work and look for opportunities to accelerate these best we can. Again, we continue to work several sales campaigns, which will ultimately be the deciding factor of any potential rate adjustments.
Longer term, we're aggressively driving productivity throughout the business to maximize profitability as we strive to achieve mid-teen operating margins at both BCA and BDS. These are aspirational goals, and we certainly have a lot of work to do and hard decisions in front of us. However, we believe this is the right objective and goal for us and our teams.
We're guiding -- regarding our outlook for cash flow growth next year, as expected, widebody production rate decisions can modestly affect that rate of growth. However, we still continue to see operating cash flow growing in '17 and then again '18 and beyond. Our confidence in this outlook is based on us delivering on a robust backlog; executing on our established development programs; driving additional productivity efforts; and finally, improving the cash profile on the 787 program. We have a strong foundation to grow cash flows over the remainder of the decade, and we are taking the necessary actions to derisk the business while also more efficiently executing all elements of the business.
Again, we still have some work to do to finalize our outlook for 2017. And as always, we'll provide more detail on the full year 2017 guidance on our call -- on our January earnings call.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000-plus aircraft being widebodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle. Just looking at the existing fleets, t",423,"Great question, Jason. So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000-plus aircraft being widebodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle. Just looking at the existing fleets, that starts early in the next decade, early 2020s. In particular, if we look at the 777 fleet and we look for opportunities there, we'll have a number of aircraft that will be reaching 10-year lifespan at that point in our replacement cycles. That timing is very well aligned with when we'll be ramping up and beginning to deliver the 777X. And that's been one of the things that's been fueling our focus on delivering that development program. In addition to that, that 787 is going to be very well positioned for that market. We're continuing to see market dynamics that are expanding route structures, leveraging the technology of that airplane. If you look at 787 since we've introduced it, our customers have now introduced more than 130 new city pairs based on the unique capability that the 787 brings to the marketplace. So we see strong opportunity for replacement of existing fleets. We see growth opportunities, as passenger traffic continues to grow at a clip of about 6% a year. And we see growth associated with new city pairs, new routes that are being enabled by the technology. All 3 of those fuel our prospects for the future, and we see a solid mix of both the 787 family and the 777 family feeding right into that cycle. That all said, we've got a couple of years near term in front of us here where we're working through the transition to the 777, and we're being mindful of some of the local widebody market hesitation that we're all seeing right now. We're confident that we're going to be able to work our way through that in a profitable and effective manner, transition to the 777X and then move into that replacement cycle. Strong demand signals as we get into the next decade. And through all of this, we're going to be very mindful about matching supply and demand. It's in all of our interest to make sure those stay balanced and that we take the right actions to ensure that we do things profitably and efficiently through the transition. So that's some color around it. But again, if we look at the 20-year cycle here, widebody marketplace is a strong marketplace, and it's both replacement and growth driven."

And of course, we'll be ramping up 777X production nominally to the kind of production rates that we have on today's 777 line. 787 is where we're looking at that additional production step-up to 14 a month. And we'll be assessing that here over the next 6 months. So that longer-term profile will look flat to modest growth in production volume on our widebody lines overall."

I think you know -- just kind of some of the bigger moving pieces in 2017: Obviously, the 787 cash profile continuing to improve and the production rates we've talked about. At the same time, as you mentioned, tankers slightly, but cash taxes will pay more of those as we improve the unit-by-unit improvement on the 787. And then as we talked about, we're building the 787-10 flight test airplanes. So those -- and then of course, 777 rate going down to the planned 7 a month. So those are really the bigger moving pieces as we look into '17. But certainly, tanker is part of that but not as significant as some of these items. So we're continuing to execute there, and we'll expect positive cash flow next year."

But it's not something that we just stated without an intent to pursue. We're very serious about pursuing that. And we see a path to getting there. It requires a lot of hard work. Key items there will include increasing profitability on the 787 program. So if you're looking for milestones and checkpoints there, you'll see as we burn down deferred production inventory -- hopefully, you saw a good sign there this quarter. As we continue to drive profitability on that line, you will see improved profitability, incremental pickups on margins in BCA. Also, additional work on Partnering for Success as we work across our supply chain, you'll see incremental improvements as we both capture agreements that are already in place or additional cost reductions in our supply chain. And we are relentless on our broader Lean Plus activities and Capturing the Value of Quality activities that get into all of our production lines. And incrementally, those will add to profitability over time. Also, making sure we execute on our development programs and cleanly finishing up on 737 MAX, which, as you know, we're expecting to deliver ahead of schedule. We're executing well on 777X, but we're very focused on ensuring we get to the finish line cleanly on those development programs. So at a very detailed level, we work that into our business plans and commitments. Our team is onboard and driving execution. We're very focused on getting to double-digit margins here in the near term and achieving those mid-teen margins towards the end of the decade.

So combined with all the initiatives that we have in place across all aspects of the business and cost elements, at the same time, a keen eye on how do we derisk anything, as you've seen from moderating the 747 rate, development program, execution. The 737 MAX introduction, I think, is a good example of derisking to ensure that we have long-term profitability over the portfolio. Same thing with the moves we're making on 777 transition, the 777X. So trying to be mindful of moderating and derisking, where certainly that's been a challenge of the past. And that is also a contributor to this kind of long -- this longer-term objective. But as Dennis said, I mean, we think it's the right objective to have in place. We don't have all the answers today, but we have some solid plans in place around the attributes or elements that Dennis indicated. Some of those, we're going to be successful on. Some of them, we may not. And we'll, I'll say, retool and look for further opportunities, but we think it's the right objective for us to focus on."

So our current plan, as you know, is we're stepping down to a 7 a month production rate starting 2017, carrying that through the transition. And during 2018, when we're building 777X flight test aircraft, the effective delivery rate of airplanes is 5.5 a month, as you noted. That's our current baseline plan. At that plan, we are currently 85% sold-out in 2017 and roughly 60% sold-out in 2018. And we painted a number of scenarios around that baseline for the future. And just to give you a feel for it, one of the scenarios would be to take that baseline plan and drop it by 2 aircraft a month in 2018, as you noted. And if we were to do that with no additional sales, we're already more than 90% sold-out against that profile, that skyline in 2018. So I see that as a bounding case. Now we have a number of important campaigns still underway. We are encouraged by the positive result, the recent Qatar Airways decision. Great customer there. And that order for 10 777s was one of those significant campaigns that we've been working on. We have others that we're still working on. So as we finalize those over the next couple of months, we'll be able to finalize our decisions for the 2018 production rate. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of the bounding cases here. And across all of those scenarios that I just described, all of them, we see cash growing year-over-year in 2017 and then again in 2018. And I think that's an important thing to remember.

And these fixed-price development programs have been challenging, and we've been transparent about some of the issues we've had on tanker and Commercial Crew and confident in the recovery actions we've taken on those. But more broadly, we've learned those lessons about how to do development programs and do them in a way that still delivers breakthrough capability for our customers but deliver them in more incremental, risk-managed steps. And I think a great example of that -- you now see some of that process improvement bearing fruit in our commercial developments. 737 MAX, for example, being delivered on time -- actually, a little ahead of schedule and on cost. 787-10, again, our ability to now incrementally in a risk-managed way bring breakthrough capability to our customers. That's part of our broader deployment of our Development Program Excellence initiative. Part of our focus on that -- and hopefully, you see our actions there, recently elevating positions. My direct report ExCo, Scott Fancher, with responsibility for Development Program Excellence writ large, so that we even more so deliver on some of those initiatives across the enterprise. So I think what you see here is that we're very focused on being world-class at development programs. We've learned some tough lessons. We've addressed those. We've made some process improvements. You're seeing those beginning to pay off on programs like 737 MAX. And you can count on the fact that that's going to be our focus going forward. We must be able to deliver breakthrough innovation for our customers but deliver it in a step-wise, risk-managed way. And that's how we're going to do business going forward."

Whereas in the past, we might have had peaks and valleys. We have a much more consistent, steady R&D profile going forward, thinking about the portfolio development programs and clean execution. But profitability, more broadly, is driven by the other actions we've talked about, specifically 787. And now that we've turned the corner, as you saw in deferred production inventory, as an example, we are driving productivity increases on that line and just spending some time with Ray and the team down there, really making some very solid progress on driving profitability into 787. Over time, again, that will incrementally increase overall company profitability. The work on Partnering for Success, the broader application of Lean initiatives throughout our enterprise, the list of things I mentioned earlier in response to Doug's question, those are all factors that longer term will drive overall enterprise profitability and create our investment capacity for the future."

So getting the 737 MAX and the full family, the 7, 8 and 9, delivered and continuing to ramp up the 787 and satisfies customers' future needs with that family, that could be the end outcome here that we simply deliver on those 2 programs as currently defined. We're also continuing to look at a potential additional stretch of the MAX. We have some very good options there that could create value for our customers. And we're marching through our assessment of that, making good progress there. That's a decision that's more in the near term. We'll work our way through. And then longer term, we're continuing to look at the so-called middle of the market airplane or options in that space, again, having very productive dialogue with customer, firming up our opportunities there. If we were to go with that new airplane, that would be more in the 2024, 2025 entry into service range. On the other hand, an additional stretch of the MAX could be done more around the end of this decade, just to give you a sense for the timing there. And it's a realistic possibility that we could do both. We have the capacity and the ability to do both, and the time line and phasing of those would allow us to do both. So we're looking across that whole range of solutions. And over the next several months, we'll work through our decision process."

So first of all, in terms of customer dialogue, as we said, the overall market assessment today is a positive one, if you take a long-term view. The 20-year market and the need for 39,600 new aircraft, that's slightly up compared to last year's current market outlook. So a robust long-term market. I'd say, right now, in our customer conversations, certainly more positive in the narrowbody arena than in widebodies. As we said, there's hesitation in the widebody marketplace right now as we think through a number of factors around the world: slow GDP growth around the world, hesitation in cargo traffic, geopolitical questions. There are a number of factors that are causing our customers to be somewhat hesitant in widebodies in particular. So we're being mindful of that and working with our customers as we plan for the future. Narrowbodies, well, again, it's all in the context of some broad global economic concern. The ordering activity and the robustness of narrowbody growth continues to be very clear, fueled by traffic growth. And as we said earlier, as we ramp up the 737 line to 57 a month, we continue to be oversold against that profile. And just as another data point, deferrals and cancellations remain at historical lows, at about 1% of backlog. And load factors and utilization rates on aircraft fleets, again, remain generally very high compared to historical averages. So that's a composite view of the marketplace. We're staying very close to our customers, making sure they get the support they need, maintaining a balanced view of the future. But there's more upside than downside in the overall marketplace, and we're going to make sure we have a balanced approach to how we run the business. This is a good, steady, long-term growth business. Now on your comments about revenue, so all consistent what we've talked about before, but Greg, remind them one more."

In our narrowbody marketplace, the demand signals remain very strong. As I said, traffic growth looks very positive, sustaining at about 6% a year. The fact that our market is strong, our backlog is built out, that we're oversold against the production rate ramp-up on 737 that I described earlier, that just adds strength to our supply chain in that marketplace. So whether that attracts more participation from suppliers or they are more eager to participate in a robust, growing marketplace, I think that's good for Boeing, it's good for our suppliers.

And I think where we have been spending more time on the Partnering for Success to help the suppliers is taking some of the initiatives that have been proven to be successful on lines like F-18, on the 737 and some of the recent, frankly, breakthroughs on the 787 and taking those back into the supply chain. And I think, as Dennis indicated, that makes the supply chain healthier, which I think we'll all benefit from. And so if there is any trade-offs or any challenges that they may be having around the business jet, this is a great opportunity to take some of these productivity, working capital-type initiatives and partner together and really make overall operations more efficient.

So those are the big moving pieces within tax for this quarter. But as you look forward into next year, you're going to see more of a, I'll say, normalized tax rate of about 31% to 32%."

In looking at the 777X, some of the issues that have been -- you've been working through on the thought build process and engineering layoffs, most of the contractors directs online for layoffs -- minimal layoffs but still layoffs later this year. What can you tell us to reassure us that there's not going to be a difference between your optimistic outlook for developments and the reality of the program as it proceeds? And related to that, would the -- where are you guys with headcount? Are you good? Or do you expect further trims?"

Let me address the first part of your question there. And Dan, if you take a look at 777X and the FAUB example, the fuselage upgrade build, this represents exactly the risk mitigation approach that I talked about earlier, the fact that we're not wait",278,"Yes. Let me address the first part of your question there. And Dan, if you take a look at 777X and the FAUB example, the fuselage upgrade build, this represents exactly the risk mitigation approach that I talked about earlier, the fact that we're not waiting for the 777X production ramp-up to test out the new production automation system. We actually pulled it ahead, implemented it on the existing 777 line to derisk it. Now that derisking process hasn't been completely clean. As you well know, we've had some challenges ramping it up. But our ability to pull it ahead into the existing 777 line has dramatically reduced our risk. It's allowed us to wring out the automation systems, and we've now delivered more than 20 units using that process. So that's a great example of accelerating innovation, derisking it for the future and adds to our confidence that 777X will be delivered as planned. And now your broader comment about headcount and jobs, of course, we're always very mindful about what we're doing on this front. We put a lot of value into our employees and our team. We've got a great team, I'd say the best team in the world. At the same time, we're dealing with market realities around competitiveness and challenging market environment. So we'll continue to take the right actions to make sure we're a profitable business that can invest in the future, and we're going to continue to invest in our team. But headcount variations are a natural part of our business, and we're very diligent about handling those in a balanced way, in a way that's very respectful of our team."

All of the scenarios we're looking at allow us to transition effectively. And that just adds, again, confidence in our ability to not only deliver 777 but to ramp up 777X, keeps the line profitable while we do that and make sure the whole enterprise production line stays healthy."

My comments today will focus on our third quarter results and our business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details and provide you a glimpse into 2017.
With that, let's move to Slide 2. Our third quarter financial results reflect continued solid performance at both businesses and strong operating cash flow. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash and repurchased $1 billion of Boeing stock during the quarter, as we continue to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders while investing in innovation and our future growth. Through the first 3 quarters, we repurchased 51 million shares totaling $6.5 billion.
Revenue in the third quarter was $23.9 billion, reflecting slightly lower planned delivery volume as well as continued growth in both commercial and defense services. We reported core earnings per share of $3.51 on continued overall solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes third quarter revenue was $17 billion on 188 deliveries with a segment operating margin of 9.4%. Key milestones in the quarter included completing testing to ensure the 737 MAX 8 is ready to enter service and starting 737 MAX 9 production. Furthermore, in October, we began 787-10 midbody integration, and we rolled out of the factory our 500th 787 Dreamliner.
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, third quarter revenue was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, reflecting solid performance on production and services programs, offset by the Commercial Crew charge. Key contract awards for the defense side of the business included a $2.8 billion order for 19 KC-46 Tankers for the U.S. Air Force, an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to purchase 50 Apache attack helicopters and 9 P-8 Poseidon aircraft and a $1 billion award from the Defense Logistics Agency for F/A-18 spare parts.
In summary, for the quarter, we delivered solid operating results in both businesses, drove further productivity across the enterprise, captured significant contract awards and continued to return cash to shareholders.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our view of the business environment remains generally positive with solid overall demand for commercial airplanes, defense and space platforms and services and support. In the commercial market, new order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace. In particular, we're seeing strong demand for narrowbody aircraft such as the 737 MAX. In the widebody segment, we continue to see some near-term hesitation in certain regions, and the order activity has been more measured. Over the long term, however, our view remains highly positive, with our 20-year commercial market outlook projecting demand for more than 39,600 aircraft valued at $6 trillion. Specifically for the widebody market, we see demand over the next 20 years for more than 9,000 aircraft and see replacement demand starting to accelerate again early next decade, and we're well positioned with the 777X and 787 families.
We also recently updated our outlook for the commercial market in China, where we now see a $1 trillion market opportunity for more than 6,800 aircraft over the next 20 years.
The continued strength of our overall market outlook is based on solid ongoing replacement demand and traffic growth. This year, passenger traffic growth is again outpacing GDP with IATA reporting an approximately 6% increase year-to-date.
On the cargo side, the market is improved slightly, but year-to-date growth is modest at 1%. As always, we are keeping a consistent watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand remain balanced.
Despite the relative softening we've described for the widebody market, the strength and value of our offerings is illustrated by recent order activity for a total of 52 widebody planes. In October, Qatar Airways ordered 30 787-9s and 10 777-300ERs and China Southern ordered 12 787-9s.
In addition, we are pleased that the U.S. Treasury recently granted Boeing a license to sell 80 new airplanes to Iran Air, including a mix of 34 widebody planes. There's more work to do to finalize the sale, but we are encouraged by the progress.
As we have noted on a number of occasions, the timing and outcome of several ongoing widebody sales campaigns will be the determining factors in final decisions on the 777 bridge production rate. We expect to have additional clarity on 777 production decisions in the next couple of months. On the 787 program, we have more time to further assess the implementation of the next production rate increase that is currently scheduled to ramp up to 14 per month at the end of the decade.
Also, as a reminder, even if we have to moderate our widebody production plans in the future, we continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to grow beyond 900 airplanes per year through the end of this decade, supporting our expectation that we will continue to grow cash flow year-over-year throughout this time period.
Our production plan is built upon our large and diverse order backlog and underpinned by our fundamental belief in the long-term growth and replacement trends that have fueled increasing commercial airplane demand for the past several decades.
Turning to individual airplane programs. Customer demand remains strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of more than 4,300 firm orders for the NG and MAX models combined. We remain on track to raise the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 47 in the third quarter of 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold. Simply put, this is a big attractive market, and the 737 family's position within it is solid.
For the current-generation 777, our backlog now stands at more than 160 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 17 net new 777 orders. We are on track to transition to the 7 per month production rate at the start of 2017, as previously announced. At that rate and with the Qatar order I mentioned earlier, delivery slots for 777 are now about 85% sold out for 2017. For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of 777X test aircraft, we are roughly 60% sold out at the planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month.
To balance some scenarios for you on the 777, when we consider the recent order additions and our ongoing campaigns to fill the remaining delivery slots, at this time, we don't envision a situation where we would need to lower production more than 1 or 2 units per month below our current plan. If that were to occur, implementation would begin in late 2017 or early 2018. On the other end of the spectrum, should we see success on ongoing campaigns, we may not need to adjust our existing production plans at all. 
We have disciplined processes in place for making these decisions in a timely manner as campaigns are finalized. And of course, any steps we might take to further align production with demand will include the necessary adjustments to maximize profitability and ensure a smooth transition to the 777X.
For the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 306 orders that supports our production plan of ramping up deliveries in 2020 and beyond.
On the 787 program, our backlog consists of approximately 700 firm orders which provide a solid foundation for future production.  As I alluded to before, securing additional orders to solidify the 14 per month production rate at the end of the decade remains a priority. And the recent orders for 42 aircraft from Qatar Airways and China Southern improves our position, but there's still more work to do.
On the 747 program, we are encouraged by the modest recovery in the air cargo market, and we continue to have a number of sales campaigns underway that will help to fill the production skyline.
Regarding commercial services, the market is an attractive opportunity that we are aggressively targeting by growing our services and support areas, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrade business as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services.
During the quarter, we entered into an agreement with Japan Airlines for a 10-year contract to provide spare parts under the Boeing GoldCare program. In addition, over the past few months, we won orders from Atlas Air to convert 9 767 passenger airplanes into Boeing-converted freighters.
Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive due to our market-leading product lineup, large, high-quality customer backlog and a culture that continuously drives productivity across all aspects of the enterprise.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. While the fiscal year 2017 U.S. Federal budget is not yet finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is firm, and we continue to anticipate modest defense spending growth over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. We are encouraged by the recent White House approval and the congressional notification authorizing the sale of 36 F-15s to Qatar with options for 36 more and the sale of 28 F-18s to Kuwait with options for an additional 12.
During the third quarter, international customers represented 27% of BDS revenue and 38% of the current backlog. Our team is continuing to reshape our defense business with a focus on dramatically improving our cost structure. This is further enhancing our competitive position and expanding profitability. The team has captured nearly $6 billion of operating cost savings, and we continue to target an additional $2 billion.
In addition to improving cost competitiveness and affordability, we are also focused on investing in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. Capturing future franchise programs remains a priority for us, and we're leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X Trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities, including the unmanned aircraft carrier-based MQ-25A, where we recently won a U.S. Navy contract for risk-reduction activities.
In summary, our overall business outlook is aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and we are optimistic and motivated by our future prospects. Our dedicated and talented teams across the enterprise are focused on delivering on our customer commitments while accelerating improvements in quality, safety and productivity and driving further innovation in our products and processes. We continue to generate results and identify additional opportunities through implementation of Lean Plus, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second century design and manufacturing initiatives.
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion driven by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51 as",1091,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion driven by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51 as solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments totaled $0.98, more than offset the $0.16 impact on the Commercial Crew program. The $0.28 tax adjustment for the 2011-2012 settlement was expected and already factored into our full year core EPS guidance. However, the $0.70 related to the tax-basis adjustment booked in this quarter was not reflected in our annual guidance. Just to be mindful for next year, we expect to have a more normalized corporate tax rate of approximately 31% to 32%.
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the third quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17 billion on 188 airplane deliveries. BCA reported operating margins of 9.4% driven by solid operating performance and delivery mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9 billion in net orders during the third quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $409 billion and more than 5,600 aircraft, equating to approximately 7 years of production.
On the 787 program, the deferred production balance declined by $151 million in the quarter. This decrease was driven by delivery mix, internal productivity efforts and supplier step-down pricing. Over the long term, we continue to focus on improving 787 cash generation, and again driven by favorable mix, further internal productivity improvements and, again, additional supplier step-down pricing.
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue of our defense business was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, largely driven by strong performance at BMA and GS&S that was offset by results in Network & Space. Boeing Military Aircraft revenue was $3.3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and F-15 volume. Operating margins of 13.3% reflect solid execution across the portfolio. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion. Operating earnings were $35 million, reflecting the impact from the Commercial Crew program. As a result of delays in completion of engineering and supply chain activities of the program, we recorded $124 million reversal of cumulative pretax earnings and a $38 million pretax reach-forward loss. At our Global Services & Support business, revenue increased 17% to $2.5 billion, reflecting higher volume in Aircraft Modernization & Sustainment. Operating margins were 12.4%, reflecting strong performance in program mix.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog at $53 billion with 38% of that business coming from customers outside the United States.
Next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the third quarter was driven by solid operating performance across the enterprise. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis indicated earlier, we paid nearly $700 million in dividend and repurchased 7.6 million shares for $1 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 51 million shares for a total of $6.5 billion. Again, returning cash to shareholders, along with continuing to invest and support future growth, remain a priority for us and reflect our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.
Let's move to cash and debt balance now on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. And again, our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Let's turn now to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $500 million to now be between $93.5 billion and $95.5 billion on higher 747 and 787 commercial airplane deliveries, and guidance has increased 5 airplanes to now be between 745 and 750 deliveries for the year. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is increased by $0.70 to now be between $6.80 and $7 a share, reflecting the third quarter tax-basis adjustment. While we haven't yet finalized our plans for 2017, we'd like to give -- take a moment and provide you with some initial insight. As Dennis previously mentioned back in September, we expect 2017 to be a year -- another year of solid financial performance.
So first and foremost, our view on cash flow growth is unchanged. We continue to forecast cash flow growth in '17 and in '18 and beyond. At our current production rates, we expect higher BCA deliveries next year while revenue should be flat to slightly down, largely driven by delivery mix as we increase 737 production, implement the transition from the 777 to the 777X and begin 787-10 production. BDS revenue next year should be also flat to slightly down on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume due to milestone revenue that more than offset the higher services and tanker revenue.
Regarding operating margins, we continue to target near-term double-digit margins for both BCA and BDS. Obviously, any production rate adjustments could modestly impact near-term margin at BCA. Having said that and as we've discussed before, we have numerous productivity activities in work that we'll continue to work and look for opportunities to accelerate these best we can. Again, we continue to work several sales campaigns, which will ultimately be the deciding factor of any potential rate adjustments.
Longer term, we're aggressively driving productivity throughout the business to maximize profitability as we strive to achieve mid-teen operating margins at both BCA and BDS. These are aspirational goals, and we certainly have a lot of work to do and hard decisions in front of us. However, we believe this is the right objective and goal for us and our teams.
We're guiding -- regarding our outlook for cash flow growth next year, as expected, widebody production rate decisions can modestly affect that rate of growth. However, we still continue to see operating cash flow growing in '17 and then again '18 and beyond. Our confidence in this outlook is based on us delivering on a robust backlog; executing on our established development programs; driving additional productivity efforts; and finally, improving the cash profile on the 787 program. We have a strong foundation to grow cash flows over the remainder of the decade, and we are taking the necessary actions to derisk the business while also more efficiently executing all elements of the business.
Again, we still have some work to do to finalize our outlook for 2017. And as always, we'll provide more detail on the full year 2017 guidance on our call -- on our January earnings call.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000-plus aircraft being widebodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle. Just looking at the existing fleets, t",424,"Great question, Jason. So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000-plus aircraft being widebodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle. Just looking at the existing fleets, that starts early in the next decade, early 2020s. In particular, if we look at the 777 fleet and we look for opportunities there, we'll have a number of aircraft that will be reaching 10-year lifespan at that point in our replacement cycles. That timing is very well aligned with when we'll be ramping up and beginning to deliver the 777X. And that's been one of the things that's been fueling our focus on delivering that development program. In addition to that, that 787 is going to be very well positioned for that market. We're continuing to see market dynamics that are expanding route structures, leveraging the technology of that airplane. If you look at the 787 since we've introduced it, our customers have now introduced more than 130 new city pairs based on the unique capability that the 787 brings to the marketplace. So we see strong opportunity for replacement of existing fleets. We see growth opportunities, as passenger traffic continues to grow at a clip of about 6% a year. And we see growth associated with new city pairs, new routes that are being enabled by the technology. All 3 of those fuel our prospects for the future, and we see a solid mix of both the 787 family and the 777 family feeding right into that cycle. That all said, we've got a couple of years near term in front of us here where we're working through the transition to the 777, and we're being mindful of some of the local widebody market hesitation that we're all seeing right now. We're confident that we're going to be able to work our way through that in a profitable and effective manner, transition to the 777X and then move into that replacement cycle. Strong demand signals as we get into the next decade. And through all of this, we're going to be very mindful about matching supply and demand. It's in all of our interest to make sure those stay balanced and that we take the right actions to ensure that we do things profitably and efficiently through the transition. So that's some color around it. But again, if we look at the 20-year cycle here, widebody marketplace is a strong marketplace, and it's both replacement and growth driven."

That very large aircraft segment, we see, is more of a niche, flatter segment. The 747 is well positioned there, provides some very unique capabilities for that customer set. We don't see that as a large growth market for us, but a niche market that's sustainable. And we have the right product and we've made the right investment there for the long run. And customers that are operating in that space are giving us positive feedback on the 747-8. We see more of the growth happening in 787 and 777. And of course, we'll be ramping up 777X production nominally to the kind of production rates that we have on today's 777 line. 787 is where we're looking at that additional production step-up to 14 a month. And we'll be assessing that here over the next 6 months. So that longer-term profile will look flat to modest growth in production volume on our widebody lines overall."

I think you know -- just kind of some of the bigger moving pieces in 2017: Obviously, the 787 cash profile continuing to improve and the production rates we've talked about. At the same time, as you mentioned, tankers slightly, but cash taxes will pay more of those as we improve the unit-by-unit improvement on the 787. And then as we talked about, we're building the 787-10 flight test airplanes. So those -- and then of course, 777 rate going down to the planned 7 a month.

But it's not something that we just stated without an intent to pursue. We're very serious about pursuing that. And we see a path to getting there. It requires a lot of hard work. Key items there will include increasing profitability on the 787 program. So if you're looking for milestones and checkpoints there, you'll see as we burn down deferred production inventory -- hopefully, you saw a good sign there this quarter. As we continue to drive profitability on that line, you will see improved profitability, incremental pickups on margins in BCA. Also, additional work on Partnering for Success as we work across our supply chain, you'll see incremental improvements as we both capture agreements that are already in place or additional cost reductions in our supply chain. And we are relentless on our broader Lean Plus activities and Capturing the Value of Quality activities that get into all of our production lines. And incrementally, those will add to profitability over time. Also, making sure we execute on our development programs and cleanly finishing up on 737 MAX, which, as you know, we're expecting to deliver ahead of schedule. We're executing well on 777X, but we're very focused on ensuring we get to the finish line cleanly on those development programs. So at a very detailed level, we work that into our business plans and commitments. Our team is onboard and driving execution. We're very focused on getting to double-digit margins here in the near term and achieving those mid-teen margins towards the end of the decade.

So trying to be mindful of moderating and derisking, where certainly that's been a challenge of the past. And that is also a contributor to this kind of long -- this longer-term objective. But as Dennis said, I mean, we think it's the right objective to have in place. We don't have all the answers today, but we have some solid plans in place around the attributes or elements that Dennis indicated. Some of those, we're going to be successful on.

Yes, David, let me just paint that even more clearly because I think it's a very important question. So our current plan, as you know, is we're stepping down to a 7 a month production rate starting 2017, carrying that through the transition. And during 2018, when we're building 777X flight test aircraft, the effective delivery rate of airplanes is 5.5 a month, as you noted. That's our current baseline plan. At that plan, we are currently 85% sold-out in 2017 and roughly 60% sold-out in 2018. And we painted a number of scenarios around that baseline for the future. And just to give you a feel for it, one of the scenarios would be to take that baseline plan and drop it by 2 aircraft a month in 2018, as you noted. And if we were to do that with no additional sales, we're already more than 90% sold-out against that profile, that skyline in 2018. So I see that as a bounding case. Now we have a number of important campaigns still underway. We are encouraged by the positive result, the recent Qatar Airways decision. Great customer there. And that order for 10 777s was one of those significant campaigns that we've been working on. We have others that we're still working on. So as we finalize those over the next couple of months, we'll be able to finalize our decisions for the 2018 production rate. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of the bounding cases here. And across all of those scenarios that I just described, all of them, we see cash growing year-over-year in 2017 and then again in 2018. And I think that's an important thing to remember. This is a very robust cash growth business across all of those scenarios."

And these fixed-price development programs have been challenging, and we've been transparent about some of the issues we've had on tanker and Commercial Crew and confident in the recovery actions we've taken on those. But more broadly, we've learned those lessons about how to do development programs and do them in a way that still delivers breakthrough capability for our customers but deliver them in more incremental, risk-managed steps. And I think a great example of that -- you now see some of that process improvement bearing fruit in our commercial developments. 737 MAX, for example, being delivered on time -- actually, a little ahead of schedule and on cost. 787-10, again, our ability to now incrementally in a risk-managed way bring breakthrough capability to our customers. That's part of our broader deployment of our Development Program Excellence initiative. Part of our focus on that -- and hopefully, you see our actions there, recently elevating positions. My direct report ExCo, Scott Fancher, with responsibility for Development Program Excellence writ large, so that we even more so deliver on some of those initiatives across the enterprise. So I think what you see here is that we're very focused on being world-class at development programs. We've learned some tough lessons. We've addressed those. We've made some process improvements. You're seeing those beginning to pay off on programs like 737 MAX. And you can count on the fact that, that's going to be our focus going forward. We must be able to deliver breakthrough innovation for our customers but deliver it in a step-wise, risk-managed way. And that's how we're going to do business going forward."

Whereas in the past, we might have had peaks and valleys. We have a much more consistent, steady R&D profile going forward, thinking about the portfolio development programs and clean execution. But profitability, more broadly, is driven by the other actions we've talked about, specifically 787. And now that we've turned the corner, as you saw in deferred production inventory, as an example, we are driving productivity increases on that line and just spending some time with Ray and the team down there, really making some very solid progress on driving profitability into 787. Over time, again, that will incrementally increase overall company profitability. The work on Partnering for Success, the broader application of Lean initiatives throughout our enterprise, the list of things I mentioned earlier in response to Doug's question, those are all factors that longer term will drive overall enterprise profitability and create our investment capacity for the future."

So getting the 737 MAX and the full family, the 7, 8 and 9, delivered and continuing to ramp up the 787 and satisfies customers' future needs with that family, that could be the end outcome here that we simply deliver on those 2 programs as currently defined. We're also continuing to look at a potential additional stretch of the MAX. We have some very good options there that could create value for our customers. And we're marching through our assessment of that, making good progress there. That's a decision that's more in the near term, one that we'll work our way through. And then longer term, we're continuing to look at the so-called middle of the market airplane or options in that space, again, having very productive dialogue with customer, firming up our opportunities there. If we were to go with that new airplane, that would be more in the 2024, 2025 entry into service range. On the other hand, an additional stretch of the MAX could be done more around the end of this decade, just to give you a sense for the timing there. And it's a realistic possibility that we could do both. We have the capacity and the ability to do both, and the time line and phasing of those would allow us to do both. So we're looking across that whole range of solutions. And over the next several months, we'll work through our decision process."

The middle of the market airplane, for example, would be on the backside of the 777X development. So time line there makes good sense. All of that is consistent with our long-term R&D planning. None of this would be a significant change to our R&D profile over the next 5 years, so steady from that standpoint. And all of that fully supports our plans to grow cash year-over-year.

Let me field that first one, then Greg and I will tag team on the second one. So first of all, in terms of customer dialogue, as we said, the overall market assessment today is a positive one, if you take a long-term view. The 20-year market and the need for 39,600 new aircraft, that's slightly up compared to last year's current market outlook. So a robust long-term market. I'd say, right now, in our customer conversations, certainly more positive in the narrowbody arena than in widebodies. As we said, there's hesitation in the widebody marketplace right now as we think through a number of factors around the world: slow GDP growth around the world, hesitation in cargo traffic, geopolitical questions. There are a number of factors that are causing our customers to be somewhat hesitant in widebodies in particular. So we're being mindful of that and working with our customers as we plan for the future. Narrowbodies, while, again, they fall in the context of some broad global economic concern, the ordering activity and the robustness of narrowbody growth continues to be very clear, fueled by traffic growth. And as we said earlier, as we ramp up the 737 line to 57 a month, we continue to be oversold against that profile. And just as another data point, deferrals and cancellations remain at historical lows, at about 1% of backlog. And load factors and utilization rates on aircraft fleets, again, remain generally very high compared to historical averages. So that's a composite view of the marketplace. We're staying very close to our customers, making sure they get the support they need, maintaining a balanced view of the future. But there's more upside than downside in the overall marketplace, and we're going to make sure we have a balanced approach to how we run the business.

In our narrowbody marketplace, the demand signals remain very strong. As I said, traffic growth looks very positive, sustaining at about 6% a year. The fact that our market is strong, our backlog is built out, that we're oversold against the production rate ramp-up on 737 that I described earlier, that just adds strength to our supply chain in that marketplace.

I think the only thing I would add to that is just, obviously, as you -- as we talked earlier, when you look at just even the backlog and you see -- you can envision out 7 years, I think that's a big advantage for us and our supply chain to have that kind of a horizon and make some investments around productivity and capture those as you see kind of, I'll say, a steady production rate or, in some cases, growing. And I think where we have been spending more time on the Partnering for Success to help the suppliers is taking some of the initiatives that have been proven to be successful on lines like F-18, on the 737 and some of the recent, frankly, breakthroughs on the 787 and taking those back into the supply chain. And I think, as Dennis indicated, that makes the supply chain healthier, which I think we'll all benefit from. And so if there is any trade-offs or any challenges that they may be having around the business jet, this is a great opportunity to take some of these productivity, working capital-type initiatives and partner together and really make overall operations more efficient. So that's where we're spending, I'd say, more time in the next generation of Partnering for Success. And we think there's great opportunity there for all parties involved."

Let me address the first part of your question there. And Dan, if you take a look at 777X and the FAUB example, the fuselage upgrade build, this represents exactly the risk mitigation approach that I talked about earlier, the fact that we're not waiting for the 777X production ramp-up to test out the new production automation system. We actually pulled it ahead, implemented it on the existing 777 line to derisk it. Now that derisking process hasn't been completely clean. As you well know, we've had some challenges ramping it up. But our ability to pull it ahead into the existing 777 line has dramatically reduced our risk. It's allowed us to wring out the automation systems, and we've now delivered more than 20 units using that process. So that's a great example of accelerating innovation, derisking it for the future and adds to our confidence that 777X will be delivered as planned. And now your broader comment about headcount and jobs, of course, we're always very mindful about what we're doing on this front. We put a lot of value into our employees and our team. We've got a great team, I'd say the best team in the world. At the same time, we're dealing with market realities around competitiveness and challenging market environment. So we'll continue to take the right actions to make sure we're a profitable business that can invest in the future, and we're going to continue to invest in our team. But headcount variations are a natural part of our business, and we're very diligent about handling those in a balanced way, in a way that's very respectful of our team."

So all of the scenarios we're looking at allow us to transition effectively. And that just adds, again, confidence to our ability to not only deliver 777 but to ramp up 777X, keeps the line profitable while we do that and make sure the whole enterprise production line stays healthy."

My comments today will focus on our third quarter results and our business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details and provide you a glimpse into 2017.
With that, let's move to Slide 2. Our third quarter financial results reflect continued solid performance at both businesses and strong operating cash flow. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash and repurchased $1 billion of Boeing stock during the quarter, as we continue to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders while investing in innovation and our future growth. Through the first 3 quarters, we repurchased 51 million shares totaling $6.5 billion.
Revenue in the third quarter was $23.9 billion, reflecting slightly lower planned delivery volume as well as continued growth in both commercial and defense services. We reported core earnings per share of $3.51 on continued overall solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes third quarter revenue was $17 billion on 188 deliveries with a segment operating margin of 9.4%. Key milestones in the quarter included completing testing to ensure the 737 MAX 8 is ready to enter service and starting 737 MAX 9 production. Furthermore, in October, we began 787-10 midbody integration, and we rolled out of the factory our 500th 787 Dreamliner.
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, third quarter revenue was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, reflecting solid performance on production and services programs, offset by the Commercial Crew charge. Key contract awards for the defense side of the business included a $2.8 billion order for 19 KC-46 Tankers for the U.S. Air Force, an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to purchase 50 Apache attack helicopters and 9 P-8 Poseidon aircraft and a $1 billion award from the Defense Logistics Agency for F/A-18 spare parts.
In summary, for the quarter, we delivered solid operating results in both businesses, drove further productivity across the enterprise, captured significant contract awards and continued to return cash to shareholders.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our view of the business environment remains generally positive with solid overall demand for commercial airplanes, defense and space platforms and services and support. In the commercial market, new order activity is continuing at a moderate but healthy pace. In particular, we're seeing strong demand for narrowbody aircraft such as the 737 MAX. In the widebody segment, we continue to see some near-term hesitation in certain regions, and the order activity has been more measured. Over the long term, however, our view remains highly positive, with our 20-year commercial market outlook projecting demand for more than 39,600 aircraft valued at $6 trillion. Specifically for the widebody market, we see demand over the next 20 years for more than 9,000 aircraft and see replacement demand starting to accelerate again early next decade, and we're well positioned with the 777X and 787 families.
We also recently updated our outlook for the commercial market in China, where we now see a $1 trillion market opportunity for more than 6,800 aircraft over the next 20 years.
The continued strength of our overall market outlook is based on solid ongoing replacement demand and traffic growth. This year, passenger traffic growth is again outpacing GDP with IATA reporting an approximately 6% increase year-to-date.
On the cargo side, the market is improved slightly, but year-to-date growth is modest at 1%. As always, we are keeping a consistent watchful eye on global market conditions for both passenger travel and cargo to ensure that supply and demand remain balanced.
Despite the relative softening we've described for the widebody market, the strength and value of our offerings is illustrated by recent order activity for a total of 52 widebody planes. In October, Qatar Airways ordered 30 787-9s and 10 777-300ERs and China Southern ordered 12 787-9s.
In addition, we are pleased that the U.S. Treasury recently granted Boeing a license to sell 80 new airplanes to Iran Air, including a mix of 34 widebody planes. There's more work to do to finalize the sale, but we are encouraged by the progress.
As we have noted on a number of occasions, the timing and outcome of several ongoing widebody sales campaigns will be the determining factors in final decisions on the 777 bridge production rate. We expect to have additional clarity on 777 production decisions in the next couple of months. On the 787 program, we have more time to further assess the implementation of the next production rate increase that is currently scheduled to ramp up to 14 per month at the end of the decade.
Also, as a reminder, even if we have to moderate our widebody production plans in the future, we continue to expect commercial aircraft deliveries to grow beyond 900 airplanes per year through the end of this decade, supporting our expectation that we will continue to grow cash flow year-over-year throughout this time period.
Our production plan is built upon our large and diverse order backlog and underpinned by our fundamental belief in the long-term growth and replacement trends that have fueled increasing commercial airplane demand for the past several decades.
Turning to individual airplane programs. Customer demand remains strong for the 737 with a robust backlog of more than 4,300 firm orders for the NG and MAX models combined. We remain on track to raise the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 47 in the third quarter of 2017, followed by 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold. Simply put, this is a big attractive market, and the 737 family's position within it is solid.
For the current-generation 777, our backlog now stands at more than 160 airplanes. So far in 2016, we have added 17 net new 777 orders. We are on track to transition to the 7 per month production rate at the start of 2017, as previously announced. At that rate and with the Qatar order I mentioned earlier, delivery slots for 777 are now about 85% sold out for 2017. For 2018, when we will begin phasing in production of 777X test aircraft, we are roughly 60% sold out at the planned delivery rate of approximately 5.5 per month.
To balance some scenarios for you on the 777, when we consider the recent order additions and our ongoing campaigns to fill the remaining delivery slots, at this time, we don't envision a situation where we would need to lower production more than 1 or 2 units per month below our current plan. If that were to occur, implementation would begin in late 2017 or early 2018. On the other end of the spectrum, should we see success on ongoing campaigns, we may not need to adjust our existing production plans at all. 
We have disciplined processes in place for making these decisions in a timely manner as campaigns are finalized. And of course, any steps we might take to further align production with demand will include the necessary adjustments to maximize profitability and ensure a smooth transition to the 777X.
For the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 306 orders that supports our production plan of ramping up deliveries in 2020 and beyond.
On the 787 program, our backlog consists of approximately 700 firm orders which provide a solid foundation for future production.  As I alluded to before, securing additional orders to solidify the 14 per month production rate at the end of the decade remains a priority. And the recent orders for 42 aircraft from Qatar Airways and China Southern improves our position, but there's still more work to do.
On the 747 program, we are encouraged by the modest recovery in the air cargo market, and we continue to have a number of sales campaigns underway that will help to fill the production skyline.
Regarding commercial services, the market is an attractive opportunity that we are aggressively targeting by growing our services and support areas, including our traditional parts, mods and upgrade business as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services.
During the quarter, we entered into an agreement with Japan Airlines for a 10-year contract to provide spare parts under the Boeing GoldCare program. In addition, over the past few months, we won orders from Atlas Air to convert 9 767 passenger airplanes into Boeing-converted freighters.
Overall, the outlook for Boeing Commercial Airplanes remains positive due to our market-leading product lineup, large, high-quality customer backlog and a culture that continuously drives productivity across all aspects of the enterprise.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. While the fiscal year 2017 U.S. Federal budget is not yet finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is firm, and we continue to anticipate modest defense spending growth over the next 5 years. Internationally, demand for our offerings remains healthy as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services. We are encouraged by the recent White House approval and the congressional notification authorizing the sale of 36 F-15s to Qatar with options for 36 more and the sale of 28 F-18s to Kuwait with options for an additional 12.
During the third quarter, international customers represented 27% of BDS revenue and 38% of the current backlog. Our team is continuing to reshape our defense business with a focus on dramatically improving our cost structure. This is further enhancing our competitive position and expanding profitability. The team has captured nearly $6 billion of operating cost savings, and we continue to target an additional $2 billion.
In addition to improving cost competitiveness and affordability, we are also focused on investing in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. Capturing future franchise programs remains a priority for us, and we're leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for the T-X Trainer, JSTARS Recapitalization, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities, including the unmanned aircraft carrier-based MQ-25A, where we recently won a U.S. Navy contract for risk-reduction activities.
In summary, our overall business outlook is aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and we are optimistic and motivated by our future prospects. Our dedicated and talented teams across the enterprise are focused on delivering on our customer commitments while accelerating improvements in quality, safety and productivity and driving further innovation in our products and processes. We continue to generate results and identify additional opportunities through implementation of Lean Plus, Capturing the Value of Quality, Partnering for Success and our second century design and manufacturing initiatives.
Now over to Greg for our financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion driven by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51 as",1091,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $23.9 billion driven by solid commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenue. Core earnings per share was $3.51 as solid operating performance and favorable tax adjustments totaled $0.98, more than offset the $0.16 impact on the Commercial Crew program. The $0.28 tax adjustment for the 2011-2012 settlement was expected and already factored into our full year core EPS guidance. However, the $0.70 related to the tax-basis adjustment booked in this quarter was not reflected in our annual guidance. Just to be mindful for next year, we expect to have a more normalized corporate tax rate of approximately 31% to 32%.
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the third quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $17 billion on 188 airplane deliveries. BCA reported operating margins of 9.4% driven by solid operating performance and delivery mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9 billion in net orders during the third quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $409 billion and more than 5,600 aircraft, equating to approximately 7 years of production.
On the 787 program, the deferred production balance declined by $151 million in the quarter. This decrease was driven by delivery mix, internal productivity efforts and supplier step-down pricing. Over the long term, we continue to focus on improving 787 cash generation, and again driven by favorable mix, further internal productivity improvements and, again, additional supplier step-down pricing.
Now let's turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue of our defense business was $7.5 billion and operating margins were 10.4%, largely driven by strong performance at BMA and GS&S that was offset by results in Network & Space. Boeing Military Aircraft revenue was $3.3 billion, reflecting lower planned C-17 and F-15 volume. Operating margins of 13.3% reflect solid execution across the portfolio. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion. Operating earnings were $35 million, reflecting the impact from the Commercial Crew program. As a result of delays in completion of engineering and supply chain activities of the program, we recorded $124 million reversal of cumulative pretax earnings and a $38 million pretax reach-forward loss. At our Global Services & Support business, revenue increased 17% to $2.5 billion, reflecting higher volume in Aircraft Modernization & Sustainment. Operating margins were 12.4%, reflecting strong performance in program mix.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog at $53 billion with 38% of that business coming from customers outside the United States.
Next slide, please. Operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for the third quarter was driven by solid operating performance across the enterprise. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis indicated earlier, we paid nearly $700 million in dividend and repurchased 7.6 million shares for $1 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 51 million shares for a total of $6.5 billion. Again, returning cash to shareholders, along with continuing to invest and support future growth, remain a priority for us and reflect our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.
Let's move to cash and debt balance now on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. And again, our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Let's turn now to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2016. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $500 million to now be between $93.5 billion and $95.5 billion on higher 747 and 787 commercial airplane deliveries, and guidance has increased 5 airplanes to now be between 745 and 750 deliveries for the year. Our core EPS guidance for 2016 is increased by $0.70 to now be between $6.80 and $7 a share, reflecting the third quarter tax-basis adjustment. While we haven't yet finalized our plans for 2017, we'd like to give -- take a moment and provide you with some initial insight. As Dennis previously mentioned back in September, we expect 2017 to be a year -- another year of solid financial performance.
So first and foremost, our view on cash flow growth is unchanged. We continue to forecast cash flow growth in '17 and in '18 and beyond. At our current production rates, we expect higher BCA deliveries next year while revenue should be flat to slightly down, largely driven by delivery mix as we increase 737 production, implement the transition from the 777 to the 777X and begin 787-10 production. BDS revenue next year should be also flat to slightly down on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume due to milestone revenue that more than offset the higher services and tanker revenue.
Regarding operating margins, we continue to target near-term double-digit margins for both BCA and BDS. Obviously, any production rate adjustments could modestly impact near-term margin at BCA. Having said that and as we've discussed before, we have numerous productivity activities in work that we'll continue to work and look for opportunities to accelerate these best we can. Again, we continue to work several sales campaigns, which will ultimately be the deciding factor of any potential rate adjustments.
Longer term, we're aggressively driving productivity throughout the business to maximize profitability as we strive to achieve mid-teen operating margins at both BCA and BDS. These are aspirational goals, and we certainly have a lot of work to do and hard decisions in front of us. However, we believe this is the right objective and goal for us and our teams.
We're guiding -- regarding our outlook for cash flow growth next year, as expected, widebody production rate decisions can modestly affect that rate of growth. However, we still continue to see operating cash flow growing in '17 and then again '18 and beyond. Our confidence in this outlook is based on us delivering on a robust backlog; executing on our established development programs; driving additional productivity efforts; and finally, improving the cash profile on the 787 program. We have a strong foundation to grow cash flows over the remainder of the decade, and we are taking the necessary actions to derisk the business while also more efficiently executing all elements of the business.
Again, we still have some work to do to finalize our outlook for 2017. And as always, we'll provide more detail on the full year 2017 guidance on our call -- on our January earnings call.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

With that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000-plus aircraft being widebodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle.

So if you take a look at that 20-year current market outlook, as I said, we see about 9,000 of those 39,000-plus aircraft being widebodies. And much of that is fueled by that replacement cycle. Just looking at the existing fleets, that starts early in the next decade, early 2020s. In particular, if we look at the 777 fleet and we look for opportunities there, we'll have a number of aircraft that will be reaching 10-year lifespan at that point in our replacement cycles. That timing is very well aligned with when we'll be ramping up and beginning to deliver the 777X. And that's been one of the things that's been fueling our focus on delivering that development program. In addition to that, that 787 is going to be very well positioned for that market. We're continuing to see market dynamics that are expanding route structures, leveraging the technology of that airplane. If you look at the 787 since we've introduced it, our customers have now introduced more than 130 new city pairs based on the unique capability that the 787 brings to the marketplace. So we see strong opportunity for replacement of existing fleets. We see growth opportunities, as passenger traffic continues to grow at a clip of about 6% a year. And we see growth associated with new city pairs, new routes that are being enabled by the technology. All 3 of those fuel our prospects for the future, and we see a solid mix of both the 787 family and the 777 family feeding right into that cycle. That all said, we've got a couple of years near term in front of us here where we're working through the transition to the 777, and we're being mindful of some of the local widebody market hesitation that we're all seeing right now. We're confident that we're going to be able to work our way through that in a profitable and effective manner, transition to the 777X and then move into that replacement cycle. Strong demand signals as we get into the next decade. And through all of this, we're going to be very mindful about matching supply and demand. It's in all of our interest to make sure those stay balanced and that we take the right actions to ensure that we do things profitably and efficiently through the transition. So that's some color around it. But again, if we look at the 20-year cycle here, widebody marketplace is a strong marketplace, and it's both replacement and growth driven."

We don't see that as a large growth market for us, but a niche market that's sustainable. And we have the right product and we've made the right investment there for the long run. And customers that are operating in that space are giving us positive feedback on the 747-8. We see more of the growth happening in 787 and 777. And of course, we'll be ramping up 777X production nominally to the kind of production rates that we have on today's 777 line. 787 is where we're looking at that additional production step-up to 14 a month. And we'll be assessing that here over the next 6 months. So that longer-term profile will look flat to modest growth in production volume on our widebody lines overall."

I think you know -- just kind of some of the bigger moving pieces in 2017: Obviously, the 787 cash profile continuing to improve and the production rates we've talked about. At the same time, as you mentioned, tankers slightly, but cash taxes will pay more of those as we improve the unit-by-unit improvement on the 787. And then as we talked about, we're building the 787-10 flight test airplanes. So those -- and then of course, 777 rate going down to the planned 7 a month.

But it's not something that we just stated without an intent to pursue. We're very serious about pursuing that. And we see a path to getting there. It requires a lot of hard work. Key items there will include increasing profitability on the 787 program. So if you're looking for milestones and checkpoints there, you'll see as we burn down deferred production inventory -- hopefully, you saw a good sign there this quarter. As we continue to drive profitability on that line, you will see improved profitability, incremental pickups on margins in BCA. Also, additional work on Partnering for Success as we work across our supply chain, you'll see incremental improvements as we both capture agreements that are already in place or additional cost reductions in our supply chain. And we are relentless on our broader Lean Plus activities and Capturing the Value of Quality activities that get into all of our production lines. And incrementally, those will add to profitability over time. Also, making sure we execute on our development programs and cleanly finishing up on 737 MAX, which, as you know, we're expecting to deliver ahead of schedule. We're executing well on 777X, but we're very focused on ensuring we get to the finish line cleanly on those development programs. So at a very detailed level, we work that into our business plans and commitments. Our team is onboard and driving execution. We're very focused on getting to double-digit margins here in the near term and achieving those mid-teen margins towards the end of the decade.

So combined with all the initiatives that we have in place across all aspects of the business and cost elements, at the same time, a keen eye on how do we derisk anything, as you've seen from moderating the 747 rate, development program, execution. The 737 MAX introduction, I think, is a good example of derisking to ensure that we have long-term profitability over the portfolio. Same thing with the moves we're making on 777 transition to 777X. So trying to be mindful of moderating and derisking, where certainly that's been a challenge of the past. And that is also a contributor to this kind of long -- this longer-term objective. But as Dennis said, I mean, we think it's the right objective to have in place. We don't have all the answers today, but we have some solid plans in place around the attributes or elements that Dennis indicated. Some of those, we're going to be successful on. Some of them, we may not. And we'll, I'll say, retool and look for further opportunities, but we think it's the right objective for us to focus on."

And so we keep a very close eye on supply chain consolidation in our networks, the health of our supply chain. That is a very important part of our overall Partnering for Success effort. Obviously, in the news this week, with Rockwell's acquisition of B/E, we're taking a close look at that. We don't have any specific comments on that one, but keeping a close eye on it to ensure that we retain a healthy and competitive supply chain. Some of the consolidation pressures that you're seeing, I think it's signs that our supply chain is working with us to try to be competitive and optimize their operations and continuing to invest for the future. So I see this as a healthy dynamic. There's a lot of interest in the aerospace sector. We continue to think aerospace is an industrial sector. We'll outpace others, much of that driven by the commercial airplane marketplace and growing passenger traffic, which is outstripping GDP. So we're not surprised that there's a lot of interest in the aerospace sector. We think that's healthy. And we're going to make sure that we continue to have a robust supply chain for the future. And our Partnering for Success effort is designed to do that, to find win-win solutions for Boeing and our supply chain partners."

It makes us healthier as a company. It allows us to do a better job of delivering for our customers.

Yes, David, let me just paint that even more clearly because I think it's a very important question. So our current plan, as you know, is we're stepping down to a 7 a month production rate starting 2017, carrying that through the transition. And during 2018, when we're building 777X flight test aircraft, the effective delivery rate of airplanes is 5.5 a month, as you noted. That's our current baseline plan. At that plan, we are currently 85% sold-out in 2017 and roughly 60% sold-out in 2018. And we painted a number of scenarios around that baseline for the future. And just to give you a feel for it, one of the scenarios would be to take that baseline plan and drop it by 2 aircraft a month in 2018, as you noted. And if we were to do that with no additional sales, we're already more than 90% sold-out against that profile, that skyline in 2018. So I see that as a bounding case. Now we have a number of important campaigns still underway. We are encouraged by the positive result, the recent Qatar Airways decision. Great customer there. And that order for 10 777s was one of those significant campaigns that we've been working on. We have others that we're still working on. So as we finalize those over the next couple of months, we'll be able to finalize our decisions for the 2018 production rate. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of the bounding cases here. And across all of those scenarios that I just described, all of them, we see cash growing year-over-year in 2017 and then again in 2018. And I think that's an important thing to remember. This is a very robust cash growth business across all of those scenarios."

And these fixed-price development programs have been challenging, and we've been transparent about some of the issues we've had on tanker and Commercial Crew and confident in the recovery actions we've taken on those. But more broadly, we've learned those lessons about how to do development programs and do them in a way that still delivers breakthrough capability for our customers but deliver them in more incremental, risk-managed steps. And I think a great example of that -- you now see some of that process improvement bearing fruit in our commercial developments. 737 MAX, for example, being delivered on time -- actually, a little ahead of schedule and on cost. 787-10, again, our ability to now incrementally in a risk-managed way bring breakthrough capability to our customers. That's part of our broader deployment of our Development Program Excellence initiative. Part of our focus on that -- and hopefully, you see our actions there, recently elevating positions. My direct report ExCo, Scott Fancher, with responsibility for Development Program Excellence writ large, so that we even more so deliver on some of those initiatives across the enterprise. So I think what you see here is that we're very focused on being world-class at development programs. We've learned some tough lessons. We've addressed those. We've made some process improvements. You're seeing those beginning to pay off on programs like 737 MAX. And you can count on the fact that, that's going to be our focus going forward.

But profitability, more broadly, is driven by the other actions we've talked about, specifically 787. And now that we've turned the corner, as you saw in deferred production inventory, as an example, we are driving productivity increases on that line and just spending some time with Ray and the team down there, really making some very solid progress on driving profitability into 787. Over time, again, that will incrementally increase overall company profitability. The work on Partnering for Success, the broader application of Lean initiatives throughout our enterprise, the list of things I mentioned earlier in response to Doug's question, those are all factors that longer term will drive overall enterprise profitability and create our investment capacity for the future."

So getting the 737 MAX and the full family, the 7, 8 and 9, delivered and continuing to ramp up the 787 and satisfies customers' future needs with that family, that could be the end outcome here that we simply deliver on those 2 programs as currently defined. We're also continuing to look at a potential additional stretch of the MAX. We have some very good options there that could create value for our customers. And we're marching through our assessment of that, making good progress there. That's a decision that's more in the near term, one that we'll work our way through. And then longer term, we're continuing to look at the so-called middle of the market airplane or options in that space, again, having very productive dialogue with customer, firming up our opportunities there. If we were to go with that new airplane, that would be more in the 2024, 2025 entry into service range. On the other hand, an additional stretch of the MAX could be done more around the end of this decade, just to give you a sense for the timing there. And it's a realistic possibility that we could do both. We have the capacity and the ability to do both, and the time line and phasing of those would allow us to do both.

Let me field that first one, then Greg and I will tag team on the second one. So first of all, in terms of customer dialogue, as we said, the overall market assessment today is a positive one, if you take a long-term view. The 20-year market and the need for 39,600 new aircraft, that's slightly up compared to last year's current market outlook. So a robust long-term market. I'd say, right now, in our customer conversations, certainly more positive in the narrowbody arena than in widebodies. As we said, there's hesitation in the widebody marketplace right now as we think through a number of factors around the world: slow GDP growth around the world, hesitation in cargo traffic, geopolitical questions. There are a number of factors that are causing our customers to be somewhat hesitant in widebodies in particular. So we're being mindful of that and working with our customers as we plan for the future. Narrowbodies, while, again, they fall in the context of some broad global economic concern, the ordering activity and the robustness of narrowbody growth continues to be very clear, fueled by traffic growth. And as we said earlier, as we ramp up the 737 line to 57 a month, we continue to be oversold against that profile. And just as another data point, deferrals and cancellations remain at historical lows, at about 1% of backlog. And load factors and utilization rates on aircraft fleets, again, remain generally very high compared to historical averages. So that's a composite view of the marketplace. We're staying very close to our customers, making sure they get the support they need, maintaining a balanced view of the future. But there's more upside than downside in the overall marketplace, and we're going to make sure we have a balanced approach to how we run the business.

And that's how I would frame it up and very, very consistent with the strategy and approach that Leanne has described."

And Greg, you may want to add in here. But as we look at our supply chain, I'd say, yes, there are some elements of our supply chain that play both in the RJ and general aviation marketplace as well as our narrowbody and widebody production lines, but we're not seeing a lot of feed over between that regional jet market or general aviation market and our narrowbody market. In our narrowbody marketplace, the demand signals remain very strong. As I said, traffic growth looks very positive, sustaining at about 6% a year. The fact that our market is strong, our backlog is built out, that we're oversold against the production rate ramp-up on 737 that I described earlier, that just adds strength to our supply chain in that marketplace. So whether that attracts more participation from suppliers or they are more eager to participate in a robust, growing marketplace, I think that's good for Boeing, it's good for our suppliers. But I'm not seeing a lot of ripple effect between those 2 markets that you're describing."

I think the only thing I would add to that is just, obviously, as you -- as we talked earlier, when you look at just even the backlog and you see -- you can envision out 7 years, I think that's a big advantage for us and our supply chain to have that kind of a horizon and make some investments around productivity and capture those as you see kind of, I'll say, a steady production rate or, in some cases, growing. And I think where we have been spending more time on the Partnering for Success to help the suppliers is taking some of the initiatives that have been proven to be successful on lines like F-18, on the 737 and some of the recent, frankly, breakthroughs on the 787 and taking those back into the supply chain. And I think, as Dennis indicated, that makes the supply chain healthier, which I think we'll all benefit from. And so if there is any trade-offs or any challenges that they may be having around the business jet, this is a great opportunity to take some of these productivity, working capital-type initiatives and partner together and really make overall operations more efficient. So that's where we're spending, I'd say, more time in the next generation of Partnering for Success. And we think there's great opportunity there for all parties involved."

Let me address the first part of your question there. And Dan, if you take a look at 777X and the FAUB example, the fuselage upgrade build, this represents exactly the risk mitigation approach that I talked about earlier, the fact that we're not waiting for the 777X production ramp-up to test out the new production automation system. We actually pulled it ahead, implemented it on the existing 777 line to derisk it. Now that derisking process hasn't been completely clean. As you well know, we've had some challenges ramping it up. But our ability to pull it ahead into the existing 777 line has dramatically reduced our risk. It's allowed us to wring out the automation systems, and we've now delivered more than 20 units using that process. So that's a great example of accelerating innovation, derisking it for the future and adds to our confidence that 777X will be delivered as planned. And now your broader comment about headcount and jobs, of course, we're always very mindful about what we're doing on this front. We put a lot of value into our employees and our team. We've got a great team, I'd say the best team in the world. At the same time, we're dealing with market realities around competitiveness and challenging market environment. So we'll continue to take the right actions to make sure we're a profitable business that can invest in the future, and we're going to continue to invest in our team. But headcount variations are a natural part of our business, and we're very diligent about handling those in a balanced way, in a way that's very respectful of our team."

Our current baseline plan again is to step down to 7 a month here starting 2017. That gives us a very effective transition plan as we go into 2018 and begin building 777X flight test aircraft and also prepare the production lines to slide over to the new aircraft. As we paint through other scenarios, I mentioned earlier a scenario where if we had to come down 2 per month to keep production and demand in balance, we can also effectively transition at that level. So all of the scenarios we're looking at allow us to transition effectively. And that just adds, again, confidence to our ability to not only deliver 777 but to ramp up 777X, keeps the line profitable while we do that and make sure the whole enterprise production line stays healthy."
