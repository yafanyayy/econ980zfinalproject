Today, we're reporting fourth quarter operational earnings per share of $1.58, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. It was a good quarter overall, although developments related to resolving lingering risks and uncertainties resulted in a few nonrecurring expenses. Namely, we have 2 regulatory charges in Utility related to long-standing matters and we reported 2 additional asset impairments, reflecting the changes in strategic direction for the EWC business. 
With those things now mostly behind us, we have initiated 2016 guidance with the midpoint in line with our expectations. We also affirmed our 2017 and 2018 Utility, Parent and Other financial outlook. 2015 was a pivotal year for us. We accomplished much of what we set out to do, working in interests of all 4 of our stakeholders. For our customers, we began making investments in our long-term capital plan to continue modernizing our infrastructure and maintain a reliable and efficient system. Meanwhile, we control the overall cost in our customer bills and obtain new legislation and regulatory actions. These accomplishments facilitate our ability to continue improving our service to customers. 
Our employees, we continue to purchase -- to pursue our organizational health initiative, soliciting feedback from our workforce and using it to strengthen our culture and enhance our organization. 
For our communities, we continued our focus in education, putting particular emphasis on workforce development. We began a $5 million 5-year workforce development initiative in partnership with the communities we serve. The first round of grants will be out soon. We also contributed approximately $3 million throughout 2015 in support of education to organizations such as Teach for America, Jobs for America's Graduates and City among others. 
Our employees echoed our commitment, giving more than 95,000 hours of their time to support education and other causes. 
Combined with our work in other areas like assistance to low-income families, these contributions are accomplishing several objectives. We are creating economic activity when trained and educated people enter the workforce. We are creating valuable resources and a competitive advantage for our region, helping to attract new businesses. Our efforts work for us as we need new skilled employees. And perhaps most importantly, our efforts provide an opportunities to those that might not otherwise have one, so that the cycle of poverty can be eliminated for a family for generations to come. 
For our owners, we successfully executed on our strategy designed to provide long-term growth and stability, and therefore, increased our dividend by 2.4%, the first increase in more than 5 years. We'll continue working towards our objective of steady, predictable dividend growth. We also strengthened our credit profile, as recognized by the major rating agencies, with several positive changes in the outlooks for our ratings, along with the rating upgrade for Entergy New Orleans by Moody's. 
Nevertheless, in some ways, 2015 was a year of challenges and evolution. Our total shareholder return for 2015 was disappointing. However, our returns since September 30, have placed us second overall among our 20 utility peers. Your positive reaction to successes and other actions since the third quarter of 2015 validates the momentum we see as we move into 2016. 
At EWC, we took steps to reduce volatility and gain clarity on the future of the business. Closing Pilgrim and FitzPatrick was not the path we wanted to take. After pursuing many alternatives, they ultimately were the only options remaining for us. We know they are tough decisions for those involved and we are committed to supporting our employees who work at these plants and their communities throughout this difficult transition. 
I'll take a moment now to expand more on some of our fourth quarter 2015 accomplishments, beginning with the Utility. I've mentioned the necessity to continue to modernize our infrastructure and maintain a reliable system. To this end, our purchase of Union Power Station has received the necessarily retail regulatory approvals. One last approval was pending from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Upon closing, the purchase of this plant will provide lower cost, reliable generation to our customers for many years to come. 2015 also saw the start of a regulatory process for the St. Charles generation project, a 980-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plant to be constructed in Louisiana. We've requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of this new modern plant, which will provide economic and reliable power for many years. The targeted in service date is June of 2019. 
In addition to approval of more than $700 million of transmission investments in all 4 states of our service territory, as part of the midcontinent independent system operator, or MISO, MTEP 15 process, we initiated one of the largest transmission projects in our history. This project includes 2 new substations, expansion of 2 existing substations and 25 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines around the Lake Charles Louisiana area. It will both enhance reliability for existing customers in that area, as well as support new load in this growing region of Louisiana. Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the Certificate of Public Need Necessity at its business and executive session in December. We expect construction to begin in the first quarter of 2016. 
Our regulatory frameworks are now better aligned to facilitate future investments to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our system to benefit our customers. We're seeing the results of this improved framework and the settlement of our Arkansas rate case. The settlement reflects a net $133 million base rate increase and a 9.75% authorized return on equity, effective at the end of February. It also sets the framework for the formula rate plan with the future test year in the coming years. The Arkansas Public Service Commission is expected to act on the settlement and issue an order later this month. 
With this new regulatory structure, we will have increased financial flexibility and ability to execute on capital investments, in response to our customers' needs. Affirming this view, Moody's revised EAI's outlook to positive in April, following the adoption of the legislation allowing for a forward test year FRP and the filing of the rate case to use the new FRP. 
Moreover, the new regulatory structure will help Entergy Arkansas support economic expansion, creating jobs for our customers in these communities and spreading fixed costs over more sales and helping to maintain a rate advantage. We will be able to provide similar benefits to our customers in Mississippi as Entergy Mississippi's first FRP with forward-looking features was approved earlier in 2015. In addition, we've been partnering with Mississippi state officials to help bring 2,500 jobs to Hinds County to a $1.45 billion tire plant in our service territory. Mississippi lawmakers approved an incentive package for Continental Tires, one of the top 5 worldwide automotive suppliers, to build a new facility near Clinton. This announcement further demonstrates how Mississippi is a premier location for automotive production, as they join Nissan and Toyota in the state. 
In Texas, we're using some of the new rider mechanisms to provide similar financial flexibility and the ability to support the needs of our customers. We've reached a settlement for an incremental increase to our distribution investment rider of just over $5 million, effective at the start of the year. The Public Utility Commission in Texas approved the settlement last week. We also are nearing completion of the regulatory view of our requests for an incremental $13 million revenue requirement under a similar rider for transmission investment. We expect a proposal for a decision later this month and the commission consideration in March. 
Finally, we reached a milestone on December 29 when we received final approval from FERC to end the System Agreement among Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas and Entergy New Orleans, the 3 operating companies that remain parties to the agreement.
This is an important step towards simplifying our regulatory structure and reducing risk and uncertainty for us and our customers. It will allow us to put greater focus on the distinct opportunities at each of our retail regulatory jurisdictions as well as our core operations without the distractions from constant interregional litigation associated with this agreement. 
Along with our plans for capital investment, we are carefully monitoring the effect of these investments on our customer's bills. Based on the most recent EAI data, our average rates are over 25% below the national average. Historically low natural gas prices also have helped lower customer bills, and are offsetting some increases in base rates. As a result, our customers will continue to benefit from some of the lowest rates in the country while also benefiting from a more modern and efficient electric system. 
Looking back at EWC in the fourth quarter, we work towards resolution on the future of each of our plants, advancing our strategy to both provide capital to invest in other opportunities and to reduce risk and volatility from this part of our business. 
We closed on the sale of our 583-megawatt Rhode Island CCGT on December 17. This plant was a good investment for us. Its sale now frees up resources we can use to support other opportunities. 
The New York ISO recently determined the retirement of FitzPatrick, when combined with several other facilities, will result in a resource adequacy shortfall in 2019. However, we expect there will be more cost-effective solutions to fill this need. And ISO New England determined that there is no reliability need associated with the Pilgrim retirement in June of 2019. As a result, we will move forward with plans to close both plants. As we've said before, this difficult yet necessary steps or not what we wanted.
On a positive note, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued the license amendments for Palisades, reflecting updated guidance, inspection and analysis on the reactor vessel head embrittlement. These amendments confirmed that the plant needs the appropriate criteria to run till the end of its extended license and will not be forced into an early shutdown. At end point, we continue to pursue license renewal in each of our plants to resolve the Coastal Zone Management Act and Clean Water Act requirements remains open. 
The NRC confirmed that our timely application for renewal enabled the continued operation of the Indian Point, following the original expiration date of the unit's license this past December. Additionally, the NRC issued a draft update to the Indian Point Supplemental and Environmental Impact Statement, which reaffirm the NRC's previous conclusion at the environmental effects of Indian Point's continued operation are not an obstacle to license renewal. 
And lastly, Vermont Yankee announced that it would be ready to begin the transfer of spent fuel into dry cast starting in 2017, 2 years earlier than originally planned. We seek approval from the Public Service Board for Certificate of Public Good, so we can begin construction of the storage pad to complete the safe transfer to dry storage. 
Now it's time to look to the future. Last year's strategic accomplishments have ultimately set us up to undertake an equally ambitious list for 2016. You can read the list on Slide 3. Several listed are related to closing out the regulatory agenda we began in 2015 and using the tools we have to execute on our capital investment plan. These regulatory items include the now approved distribution rider and the pending transmission rider filings in Texas and making our first forward-looking formula rate plan filings in Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as the second combined Entergy Louisiana FRP filing using a 2015 test year. 
Also on our to do list are steps which help continue to modernize and enhance our Utility system. As I said earlier, we've requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of the St. Charles power station. We will make selections in our request for proposals for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas long-term resources in the coming months. We will began construction of the Lake Charles Transmission Project, as well as numerous other significant transmission projects. 
Lastly, we continue to move forward with the process for installing smart meters on our Utility system. Smart meters are a foundational investment in the grid modernization opportunity I spoke about at EEI. These types of investments are another way for us to lower cost and improve service for our customers. Some benefits of it AMI include operational efficiencies, timely information provided to our customers so they can better understand and control their usage and faster outage restoration and improved system reliability for our customers. 
The next step involve further engaging our regulators and other stakeholders to discuss this investment and its associated benefits, and we continue to evaluate other investments in the grid that can benefit our customers. 
The operating companies anticipate making regulatory filings where applicable for the smart meter investment between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017. A piece of the 3-year capital plan laid out in our slides today is earmarked for this initiative, and we will share more with you over time on AMI as well as what might be next. 
At EWC, we continue to make plans and preparations for transitioning the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim nuclear plants to the decommissioning phase. At Pilgrim, we will make a decision by midyear on whether to refuel the plant for another 2-year operating cycle. 
I'd like to take a moment to personally thank the more than 1,200 employees at both our Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants for staying focused on continued safe and secure operations. I want to acknowledge their professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition. After all the underlying objective that supports all of the initiative on a to-do list, it's imperative to get the fundamentals right. Without that, nothing else works. That means continuing to deliver safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers at the lowest costs. 
These actions, combined with our other ongoing initiatives, will contribute towards meeting our objectives in the interest of all 4 of our stakeholders. that is the execution of the journey we set out on 3 years ago. We have set clear objectives to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. For owners, deliver top quartile returns through steady and predicable Utility and Parent and other earnings growth and dividend growth while reducing risk, particularly in the volatile commodity-exposed generation business. 
For our customers, deliver top quartile customer satisfaction through anticipating customer needs and exceeding their expectations while keeping rates reasonable. 
For our employees, we're on the top quartile score for organizational health by providing a stable environment with a healthy culture that provides clear direction to our employees and attractive opportunities for career development. 
And for our communities, where all of us live, maintaining an active role in making things better. This includes helping to bring jobs through economic development, helping ensure we have a trained workforce available to fill those jobs, giving both our time and financial support and operating in socially and environmentally responsible way. These objectives form the basis of our strategy: investing in the utility to benefit customers while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predicable investment recovery, providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make these investments, and reducing volatility for our merchant businesses and freeing up resources to invest in other opportunities. This strategy has driven the plan for execution we played out on the 2016 to do list. From objectives to strategy, all the way through execution, we've made great progress. We have a clear vision for what we still must do. we have the tools in place to do it. We will talk more about this journey at our Analyst Day in June 9. Please mark your calendars now and we'll have more details as the day gets closer. With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

Today, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, followed by our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018. But before we get into details, the punchline is that our results and expectations remain",2077,"Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, followed by our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018. But before we get into details, the punchline is that our results and expectations remain in line with all that we have discussed with you. 
Now let's jump into 2015. Results for the quarter are summarized on Slide 4 of our presentation. Operational earnings, excluding special items, were $1.58 per share, up from $0.75 a year ago and in line with the expectations we shared last November. Most significant special items include EWC's noncash impairment of our Palisades unit and the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center. Operational earnings for the business increased due to tax items, partially offset by Utility charges, warm weather and lower wholesale power prices. 
Looking at Utility, Parent and Other, results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share increased quarter-over-quarter. The main driver was income tax as a result of the business combination for the 2 Louisiana operating companies, which was completed in October. This item contributed $1.50 to fourth quarter earnings after reserves to share $107 million with customers. The customer sharing is reflected as a reduction in net revenue. 
Unfavorable weather partially offset the tax items. 
Slide 6 shows our adjusted view of Utility Parent and other earnings, which excludes weather and normalizes for income tax items. The adjusted view was lower than the same period a year ago. However, as Leo mentioned, this quarter's result included 2 charges totaling $0.35 per share. Considering those charges, the underlying business was in line with our November expectations. 
Volume increased for both residential, weather-adjusted sales and industrial sales. Our residential growth was 1.6% and sales to industrial customers increased 0.6%, as shown on Slide 7. We continue to see gains for new and expansion projects, adding approximately 300 gigawatt hour or 2.7% to our industrial sales this quarter. However, volume from existing customers declined, due primarily to weakness in the alkalis sector and an extended outage for a key customer, which we mentioned last quarter. Recently, we have also seen weakness in the metals and wood product sectors. 
On the positive side, sales to existing petroleum refining customers increased on higher production due to continued favorable market conditions. 
EWC fourth quarter results are summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.16 in the current quarter, $0.23 lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. The most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet revenue was $44 per megawatt hour this quarter, down from $54 in 2014, excluding Vermont Yankee. Closure of VY contributed $0.05 to the decline. Conversely, the effects of last quarter's impairments reduced fuel, nonfuel O&M and depreciation expenses, which helped earnings $0.14. 
Income tax variance of $0.13 also contributed to the offset. 
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow this quarter, about $50 million lower than the same quarter in 2014. The biggest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC. 
Now I'll quickly go through full year results, summarized on Slide 10. Operational earnings for 2015 were $6 per share, up from $5.83 in 2014, once again, in line with the expectations we shared last November. Higher earnings at Utility Parent and Other drove the increase. 
As shown on Slide 11, Utility Parent and other operational earnings shares results were $4.97 in 2015 compared to $3.64 in the prior year, led primarily by the aforementioned income tax items. 
On Slide 12, adjusted Utility Parent and Other results came in at $3.08, excluding weather and normalizing for taxes, lower than in 2014. As of the charges, the fourth quarter adjusted EPS would have been the $3.43, which was also in line with our previous expectations. 
Slide 13 summarizes EWC earnings, which declined year-over-year to $1.03 in 2015 from $2.19. Lower prices was the largest driver, accounting for $1.06 of the decline. Another $0.20 was due to Vermont Yankee, and the effects of the impairment provided a $0.14 offset. Full year operating cash flow shown on Slide 14 was just under $3.3 billion in 2015, around $600 million lower than the prior year, the most significant factors were about $300 million of Hurricane Eisenach related securitization funds received in 2014, as well as revenue from our EWC business. 
Now let me wrap up 2015 results. We are initiating 2016 operational earnings guidance. Details on our 2016 assumptions, as well as sensitivities are provided in the of our presentation. Consolidated operational earnings per share guidance is $4.95 to $5.75 per share with a midpoint of $5.35 on Slide 15. We're also issuing na adjusted Utility, Parent and Other guidance range of $4.20 to $4.50 per share with $4.35 midpoint, consistent with our communications since last summer. Recall that our adjusted measure reflects normal weather and statutory taxes. 
The possibility exists for significant tax items this year as early as the second quarter, but there's too much uncertainty to put those possibilities into the guidance at this time. 
Starting with the Utility, Parent and Other just view, we expect $1.27 per share growth. Rate actions and sales growth are the largest drivers, as well as lower nonfuel O&M and the effect of the 2015 Utility charges. 
Depreciation expense is also expected to increase by about $0.30, including Union. The Union acquisition is expected to contribute a little more than $0.20 in the bottom line in 2016. As you know, we have not closed that transaction yet, and 2016 earnings would be reduced about $0.02 for every month of delay. 
The Arkansas settlement agreement has filed with Entergy Arkansas move much closer towards allowed return levels. We expect the Arkansas Public Service Commission to issue a decision soon. 
Our industrial sales growth in 2016 continues to be driven by identified new and expansion projects in our service territory, rather than our existing customer base. Approximately 2/3 of our debt expansion projects are already in service to continue to reach steady low levels in 2016 and the remaining 1/3 comes from projects that are scheduled to come into service this year, most of which are in the final stages of construction or early stages of testing. 
Nevertheless, these new projects continue to have timing and ramp rate risks, which could impact results. 
Our industrial sales are also exposed the market and commodity risk associated with the broader economy. As a result of these risk, our overall industrial growth expectations in 2016 is now at 2.9% and overall retail sales growth is at 1.9%. 
We see Utility, nonfuel O&M at about $2.5 billion or about $0.20 lower than 2015, due primarily to pension and OPEC costs, which are expected to decline about $0.29. This includes a slightly higher pension discount rate than we expected at EEI. The change in the discount rate offset the higher ANO column 4 expenses, now projected to be $50 million in 2016, about flat year-over-year. 
We also anticipate lower expenses for fossil and nuclear in 2016, as well as higher expenses for the Union plant operations. 
Turning to EWC, its guidance midpoint is $1 per share, about the same as the 2015 results. Lower energy and capacity prices are expected to largely offset the effects of impairments recorded in 2015. Effects from the 2015 impairments, which affected multiple line items are $0.49 per share year-over-year. 
Our guidance, based on year-end prices, assumes average energy and capacity revenue of $48 per megawatt hour. Despite our 86% hedge position, there is $0.25 per share downside sensitivity to a $10 per megawatt hour drop in prices. The prices have been lower by about $4 since the beginning of the year with the warm winter weather. 
EWC's pension and OPEC expense will also decline about $0.10 year-over-year, offsetting higher Pilgrim column 4 costs and inflation effects bring net nonfuel O&M to a little less than $0.10 lower, along with earnings about $0.10 lower in 2016. 
Looking ahead to first quarter results, based on what we know today, we're expecting operational earnings generally in line with first quarter consensus of around $1.10 per share. This considers milder weather experienced so far this year, including $0.07 of negative effect already in January, and we don't currently anticipate any significant tax items in the first quarter. 
Moving to our longer-term views, Slide 16 shows our Utility, Parent and Other adjusted earnings per share outlook, which is unchanged since EEI. The foundation for our objective to achieve steady and predictable Utility, Parent and Other growth is rate base growth from the Utility investment plan. The 2016 through 2018 capital plan is about $1.1 billion than the preliminary estimates provided at EEI but primarily, because the Union acquisition was delayed into 2016. 
As Leo discussed, our capital outlook is also supported by regulatory mechanisms, which provide increased financial flexibility to execute on capital plans, and by longer-term retail sales growth, which can help mitigate rate effects for our customers. We also see continued O&M improvement as the assumed pension discount rate increases slightly slowly overtime And ANO Column 4 spending roll off. There could be some level of continued spending to maintain ANO performance improvement upon Column 4 exit or additional costs as a result of the NRC's inspection. We expect any prudently incurred incremental cost to be recoverable. 
The near-term changes to our sales growth for 2016 do not have an impact on our long-term 4% to 5% annual industrial growth expectations through 2018. We continue to see large industrial products coming  online to drive the growth. Overall, our annual retail sales growth is still expected to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which implies residential and commercial as slightly less than 1%. 
Finally, it is important to remember that our capital plan is driven more by our need to modernize our aging infrastructure and maintain reliability and less by our need to support loan growth. As a result, our strategic objective and investment thesis, dividend growth and resulting earnings outlook remain on track. 
Slide 17 provides our EWC outlook for EBITDA with separate estimates for the nuclear plants that are closed or planned to be closed. Current forecast is based on market prices as of year-end. As I mentioned, market prices have declined since that time. One other thing that we closely monitor is our cash and credit position. 
Slide 18 summarizes our cash flow and credit metrics. Efforts focused on improving cash flow and the business create both value and stability. Our goal is to remain solidly and investment grade credit range for all our rated entities while we support the growth of the rest of the business. 
Now on the slide to the credit position is our pension liability. Despite a slight negative return on our pension  assets in 2015, we were able to improve our funded status by about $250 million. Although many factors impact that number, the reality is that we continue to take sustainable steps to manage our pension obligation in a methodical way. This includes program changes, liability management, efforts and investments in the $800 million over the past 2 years. Over the next 3 years, we expect to contribute over $1.1 billion to our pension trust, including almost $400 million in 2016. 
Before closing, I'd like to acknowledge that David Board is with us today on the earnings call. We recently announced that David will assume Paula Waters' role as Vice President of Investor Relations in mid-March. You'll have the opportunity to meet David on the road in the coming weeks. David's background on Wall Street, both as a lawyer and an investment banker, makes him as strong fit for the Investor Relations role. He also worked as part of Entergy group before becoming a key team members supporting Theo and Utility strategy to risk role as Director of utilities and the business partners group. David will continue to pursue the standards of excellence we have tried to achieve in our disclosure and our relations with all of you. 
At the same time, Paula is not going far. She has been given new responsibilities within Utility where she will oversee top line growth strategies, including economic development and revenue forecasting in support of the 5 Utility operating companies. We appreciate Paula's remarkable tenure in Investor Relations as she has been instrumental in helping us clarify our discussions and strengthening our relationships with you, the analyst community. Thank you, Paula. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions"

I think from our perspective, we'd rank that confidence higher, a little higher than we had say few years ago at the analyst meeting because primary, a lot of the project that have advanced relative to that point in time, and also we've gotten a better line of sight on what's really happening from an economic perspective as it relates to what you're seeing with commodity markets. As we talked about at EEI, as you look '15 through '18, basically 95% of that growth or what we call new and expansion projects were related to projects that weren't in advanced stages. And we continue to see that to be the case. That's not to say that we see some projects, smaller projects, maybe falloff as we go forward. And if you also recall at EEI, that 95%, about 70% was made up of basically a handful of large projects that were in advanced stages and those projects were primarily in the steel, we did have an LNG project, and we also have projects in the ammonia area, as well as methanol. So it was spread across a lot of value segments. As we continue to get closer and as we move closer in time to the expected construction, data completion dates of these projects, clearly, we get more visibility around where those projects are just by the sheer passage of time. I think the other thing that we have gotten more visibility around is what's going on with our existing customers and got more granularity as to what's happening in that particular area and we don't really see much growth when we talk about the 4% to 5% coming from our existing customer base. But as we talked about in the past, our existing customers are large industrial customers fixed rate demands type contracts and so, while we may see Volumetric fluctuations, really don't see fluctuations in revenue when you talk about downside situations. I think our confidence is higher. I mean, clearly, as Drew said in the script, there are still extra that can affect what we're seeing. But we monitor this on a very regular basis, and we try to get as much in the run is as we possibly can, both from a customer perspective, as well as the macroeconomic perspective."

Also I think if you look at what we've experienced, even at '15 for the companies within that region, we have residential sales growth ranging from 1.5% to about 3% on a weather-adjusted basis. The commercial sales growth basically in the 1% to 2% on a weather-adjusted basis in that area. And so as we look forward, we see, for example, on the commercial side, major projects that happened in '15 that will have a full year effect in '16, that contribute to what we view as a fairly reasonable sales growth expectation in the commercial side. In the residential area, we do pockets of what we call maybe the multiplier effect related to the industrial growth that we see again in that Gulf South, Gulf Coast regional area. And I'd also say that one thing that we take advantage of in 2016 is another day of kilowatt hour sales that have some small impact on our expectation in 2016 as well. So around 1%, which is where we are when you adjust, when you take out the total growth and the impact of industrial. Again, macroeconomic effects, we see -- or impacts we could see at the industrial level, we could see at the residential and commercial. But we, as I said, in response to Dan's question, we've done a lot of work around updating our expectations relative to that. And at this point, we feel fairly comfortable with where we are."

So a quick question on the capital plan and your point that the aging infrastructure that drives the growth and the CapEx, not as much the load growth. But I'm assuming at some point, you do need load growth to kind of maintain your competitive rates and keep that rate and attract more I guess CapEx and more load into the region. So what is the minimum load growth that you look at from an industrial perspective, given the decline in load growth for 2016, we deceive the load growth out in the future? And is there a minimum level that you would track to say you need that kind of load at least in terms of loan growth to support the CapEx plan while keeping the rates in check?"
269764,321733888,935759,"Entergy Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","That's a good question. One thing to keep in mind, as you look at the capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies, improved rate, cost efficiency, environmental output of the new",821,"That's a good question. One thing to keep in mind, as you look at the capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies, improved rate, cost efficiency, environmental output of the new plans, plants that older more costly. So as time progresses, certainly, we have the ability to benefit our customers with a more reliable, more environmentally friendly and lower production costs unit. And so we're doing that over time just like anyone would. It just so happens that this kind of seems to happen in big chunks in terms of when the facilities are required. So we're in the process of doing that. Recall that we've never been long generation also, so we're short -- we anticipate being short generation out into the middle of next decade even with if we were to have significantly lower growth. So the need for the generation will continue to exist and what we've mentioned before is we have some flexibility around the timing as it relates to the we have the deactivations of the units and certainly, PPA's that roll off that are all part of the mix. So it's a combination of a need, but it's also us making sure we have a risk mitigation strategy for the company and for its customers associated with how we put that in place. So I know there is no -- at this industrial load growth number that we would give you that we say we no longer need this investment. But the fact of the matter is we would continue to be short with the ability to be in MISO and utilize the market over time as we go out there. And we won't see that changing under too many scenarios. The transmission investment is driven in large part by changing reliability requirements, similar type of activity as it relates to new technologies and the ability to improve the operations, so the system as we go forward plus again, the age of the infrastructure require some upgrading as well. As does our entry into MISO provide us with the opportunity to make deliverability of assets that before we couldn't into the market going forward as well. So in the transmission that we're doing from a reliability standpoint, a lot of that like the Lake Charles project, a lot of the load that we're going to serve there is already there, so it's beefing up the reliability, improving infrastructure plus load grow that we already see on the deconstruction. So that's pretty solid as well under a variety of load growth scenarios. And then as we talked about before, we're also embarking on M&A side of things and as we go forward, there could be other things that would certainly show up, that could either replace things that may or may not fall out or upwards than that capital growth going forward on the distribution side, which is going to become more and more import to benefit our customers. So I guess the bottom line here is there is an opportunity for us to continue to invest this capital because of structure is and where the state of the technology is. And we're also managing it in a real risk mitigation kind of strategy. Again, not getting long on the generation side, not getting out of our on the transmission side and I'd like to make sure that we are well within the balance of anything that might happen on a load growth point of view. But you are right, the main benefits that we have from load growth are that it continues to provide us with that competitive advantage, whereas I mentioned in my script, we're today over 25% below the national average in our rates, that contributes to our ability to attract new business into the region so that we have the capability to do that more. And so things like the Continental Tire example that I mentioned and all the steps that's under construction that Leo mentioned, all of those, in addition to us managing our cost levels, the decline in natural gas prices, all that growth contribute to that, rate advantage continuing, and hopefully, growing over time. And so, you can really say I want load growth to the capital, it's very robust over a variety of load growth scenarios but we have to be mindful of the risk mitigation strategies that we would in place when we build those new plants those but also other costs that we can do a it relates to our normal O&M, fuel costs and production costs as we put this new plans in place for example, that help us maintain that advantage. That's kind of -- it's more complicated than just one number, I guess, would be the answer. But it's pretty robust across a variety of load growth scenarios."

We ask spend a lot of time with bonus jurisdictions including Arkansas, sitting down with them, jurisdictions have done a wonderful job, regular folks of done a wonderful job, feels a wonderful job of British that we sit down and find common ground with all of them around bettering the economy of the state. And Charles, I started out with the 4 stakeholders objectives for them around first quartile TSR, first quartile customer satisfaction, et cetera. We bring jobs to the state, we do good for the company, we could do good for the community, we could do good for the employees, it's great for the political environment as well. So all we've done is we sat down and discussed that with our regulators, as well as the politicians in our regions to describe to them our desire to participate in and help them achieve their objectives. So what we've crafted in Texas with riders, in Arkansas with the forward-looking FRP, with Mississippi with the forward features of FRP, the way assets are recovered in Louisiana and New Orleans, et cetera. What we've accomplished with them is that common ground about how giving us the financial flexibility to make you all comfortable with the investments that we have through the regulatory process, helps us attract the Big River Steels the of the world, the Continental Tires of the world, to come to our region, to buy power from us, to help us invest in the infrastructure and create tens of thousands of jobs. We're working on this together to be able to do that. So I wouldn't say that anybody won the day in Arkansas other than the State of Arkansas. And we participated in that in a small way and they worked together with us to create something that allowed us to do that. And I would say that it's no different than the workforce development program that I mentioned in my script. We're spending $5 million over the next 5 years to help train people to work at those plants that we've helped to track. And that's good for all 4 of our stakeholders as well as we do that. So it really has been the last few years of extraordinary collaboration, for side regulators and thus listening to them as much as them listening to us."

Today, we're reporting fourth quarter operational earnings per share of $1.58, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. It was a good quarter overall, although developments related to resolving lingering risks and uncertainties resulted in a few nonrecurring expenses. Namely, we had 2 regulatory charges in Utility related to longstanding matters and we've reported 2 additional asset impairments, reflecting in the changes in strategic direction for the EWC business. 
With those things now mostly behind us, we've initiated 2016 guidance with the midpoint in line with our expectations. We also affirmed our 2017 and 2018 Utility, Parent & Other financial outlook. 2015 was a pivotal year for us. We accomplished much of what we set out to do, working in the interests of all 4 of our stakeholders. For our customers, we began making investments in our long-term capital plan to continue modernizing our infrastructure and maintain a reliable and efficient system. Meanwhile, we control the overall cost on our customer bills and obtain new legislation and regulatory actions. These accomplishments facilitate our ability to continue improving our service to customers. 
Our employees, we continue to purchase -- to pursue our organizational health initiative, soliciting feedback from our workforce and using it to strengthen our culture and enhance our organization. 
For our communities, we continued our focus on education, putting particular emphasis on workforce development. We began a $5 million 5-year workforce development initiative in partnership with the communities we serve. The first round of grants would be out soon. We also contributed approximately $3 million throughout 2015 in support of education through organizations such as Teach for America, STEM NOLA, Jobs for America's Graduates and [indiscernible] among others. 
Our employees echoed our commitment, giving more than 95,000 hours of their time to support education and other causes. 
Combined with our work in other areas like assistance to low-income families, these contributions are accomplishing several objectives. We are creating economic activity when trained and educated people enter the workforce. We are creating valuable resources and a competitive advantage for our region, helping to attract new businesses. Our efforts work for us as we need new skilled employees. And perhaps most importantly, our efforts provide an opportunity to those that might not otherwise have one, so that the cycle of poverty can be eliminated for a family for generations to come. 
For our owners, we successfully executed on our strategy designed to provide long-term growth and stability, and therefore, increased our dividend by 2.4%, the first increase in more than 5 years. We'll continue working towards our objective of steady, predictable dividend growth. We also strengthened our credit profile, as recognized by the major rating agencies, with several positive changes in the outlooks for our ratings, along with the rating upgrade for Entergy New Orleans by Moody's. 
Nevertheless, in some ways, 2015 was a year of challenges and evolution. Our total shareholder return for 2015 was disappointing. However, our returns since September 30 have placed us second overall among our 20 utility peers. Your positive reaction to successes and other actions since the third quarter of 2015 validates the momentum we see as we move into 2016. 
At EWC, we took steps to reduce volatility and gain clarity on the future of the business. Closing Pilgrim and FitzPatrick was not the path we wanted to take. After pursuing many alternatives, they ultimately were the only options remaining for us. We know they are tough decisions for those involved. And we are committed to supporting our employees who work at these plants and their communities throughout this difficult transition. 
I'll take a moment now to expand more on some of our fourth quarter 2015 accomplishments, beginning with the Utility. I've mentioned the necessity to continue to modernize our infrastructure and maintain a reliable system. To this end, our purchase of Union Power Station has received the necessarily retail regulatory approvals. One last approval was pending from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Upon closing, the purchase of this plant will provide lower cost, reliable generation to our customers for many years to come. 2015 also saw the start of a regulatory process for the St. Charles generation project, a 980-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plant to be constructed in Mound, Louisiana. We've requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of this new modern plant, which will provide economic and reliable power for many years. The targeted in service date is June of 2019. 
In addition to approval of more than $700 million of transmission investments in all 4 states of our service territory, as part of the mid-continent independent system operator, or MISO, MTEP 15 process, we initiated one of the largest transmission projects in our history. This project includes 2 new substations, expansion of 2 existing substations and 25 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines around the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. It will both enhance reliability for existing customers in that area, as well as support new load in this growing region of Louisiana. Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the Certificate of Public Need and Necessity at its business and executive session in December. We expect construction to begin in the first quarter of 2016. 
Our regulatory frameworks are now better aligned to facilitate future investments to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our system to benefit our customers. We're seeing the results of this improved framework and the settlement of our Arkansas rate case. The settlement reflects a net $133 million base rate increase and a 9.75% authorized return on equity, effective at the end of February. It also sets the framework for the formula rate plan with a future test year in the coming years. The Arkansas Public Service Commission is expected to act on the settlement and issue an order later this month. 
With this new regulatory structure, we will have increased financial flexibility and ability to execute on capital investments, in response to our customers' needs. Affirming this view, Moody's revised EAI's outlook to positive in April, following the adoption of the legislation allowing for a forward test year FRP and the filing of the rate case to use the new FRP. 
Moreover, the new regulatory structure will help Entergy Arkansas support economic expansion, creating jobs for our customers in these communities and spreading fixed costs over more sales and helping to maintain a rate advantage. We will be able to provide similar benefits to our customers in Mississippi as Entergy Mississippi's first FRP with forward-looking features was approved earlier in 2015. In addition, we've been partnering with Mississippi state officials to help bring 2,500 jobs to Hinds County to a $1.45 billion tire plant in our service territory. Mississippi lawmakers approved an incentive package for Continental Tires, one of the top 5 worldwide automotive suppliers, to build a new facility near Clinton. This announcement further demonstrates how Mississippi is a premier location for automotive production, as they join Nissan and Toyota in the state. 
In Texas, we're using some of the new rider mechanisms to provide similar financial flexibility and the ability to support the needs of our customers. We've reached a settlement for an incremental increase to our distribution investment rider of just over $5 million, effective at the start of the year. The Public Utility Commission in Texas approved the settlement last week. We also are nearing completion of the regulatory view of our requests for an incremental $13 million revenue requirement under a similar rider for transmission investment. We expect a proposal for a decision later this month and the commission consideration in March. 
Finally, we reached a milestone on December 29 when we received the final approval from FERC to end the System Agreement among Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas and Entergy New Orleans, the 3 operating companies that remain parties to the agreement.
This is an important step towards simplifying our regulatory structure and reducing risk and uncertainty for us and our customers. It will allow us to put greater focus on the distinct opportunities at each of our retail regulatory jurisdictions as well as our core operations without the distractions from the near constant interregional litigation associated with this agreement. 
Along with our plans for capital investment, we are carefully monitoring the effect of these investments on our customers' bills. Based on the most recent EAI data, our average rates are over 25% below the national average. Historically low natural gas prices also have helped lower customer bills, and are offsetting some increases in base rates. As a result, our customers will continue to benefit from some of the lowest rates in the country while also benefiting from a more modern and efficient electric system. 
Looking back at EWC in the fourth quarter, we work towards resolution on the future of each of our plants, advancing our strategy to both provide capital to invest in other opportunities and to reduce risk and volatility from this part of our business. 
We closed on the sale of our 583-megawatt Rhode Island CCGT on December 17. This plant was a good investment for us. It's sale now frees up resources we can use to support other opportunities. 
The New York ISO recently determined the retirement of FitzPatrick, when combined with several other facilities, will result in a resource adequacy shortfall in 2019. However, we expect there will be more cost-effective solutions to fill this need. And ISO New England determined that there is no reliability need associated with the Pilgrim retirement in June of 2019. As a result, we will move forward with plans to close both plants. As we've said before, these difficult, yet necessary, steps are not what we wanted.
On a positive note, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued the license amendments for Palisades, reflecting updated guidance, inspection and analysis on the reactor vessel head embrittlement. These amendments confirmed that the plant needs the appropriate criteria to run till the end of its extended license and will not be forced into an early shutdown. At Indian Point, we continue to pursue license renewal in each of our plants to resolve the Coastal Zone Management Act, and Clean Water Act requirements remains open. 
The NRC confirms that our timely application for renewal enabled the continued operation of the Indian Point, following the original expiration date of the unit's license this past December. Additionally, the NRC issued a draft update to the Indian Point Supplemental and Environmental Impact Statement, which reaffirm the NRC's previous conclusion that the environmental effects of Indian Point's continued operation are not an obstacle to license renewal. 
And lastly, Vermont Yankee announced that it will be ready to begin the transfer of spent fuel into dry cast starting in 2017, 2 years earlier than originally planned. We are seeking approval from the Vermont Public Service Board for Certificate of Public Good, so we can begin construction of the storage pad to complete the safe transfer to dry storage. 
Now it's time to look to the future. Last year's strategic accomplishments have ultimately set us up to undertake an equally ambitious list for 2016. You can read the list on Slide 3. Several of the items listed are related to closing out the regulatory agenda we began in 2015 and using the tools we have to execute on our capital investment plan. These regulatory items include the now approved distribution rider and the pending transmission rider filings in Texas and making our first forward-looking formula rate plan filings in Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as the second combined Entergy Louisiana FRP filing using a 2015 test year. 
Also on our to-do list are steps, which help continue to modernize and enhance our Utility system. As I said earlier, we've requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of the St. Charles power station. We will make selections in our request for proposals for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas long-term resources in the coming months. We will begin construction of the Lake Charles Transmission Project, as well as numerous other significant transmission projects. 
Lastly, we continue to move forward with the process for installing smart meters on our Utility system. Smart meters are a foundational investment in the grid modernization opportunity I spoke about at EEI. These types of investments are another way for us to lower cost and improve service for our customers. Some benefits of AMI include operational efficiencies, timely information provided to our customers, so they can better understand and control their usage and faster outage restoration and improved system reliability for our customers. 
The next step involves further engaging our regulators and other stakeholders to discuss this investment and its associated benefits, and we continue to evaluate other investments in the grid that can benefit our customers. 
The operating companies anticipate making regulatory filings where applicable for the smart meter investment between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017. A piece of the 3-year capital plan laid out in our slides today is earmarked for this initiative, and we will share more with you over time on AMI as well as what might be next. 
At EWC, we continue to make plans and preparations for transitioning the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim nuclear plants to the decommissioning phase. At Pilgrim, we will make a decision by midyear on whether to refuel the plant for another 2-year operating cycle. 
I'd like to take a moment to personally thank the more than 1,200 employees at both our Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants for staying focused on continued safe and secure operations. I want to acknowledge their professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition. After all the underlying objective that supports all of the initiatives on the to-do list is the imperative to get the fundamentals right. Without that, nothing else works. That means continuing to deliver safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers at the lowest reasonable costs. 
These actions, combined with our other ongoing initiatives, will contribute towards meeting our objectives in the interest of all 4 of our stakeholders. That is the execution of the journey we set out on 3 years ago. We have set clear objectives to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. For owners, deliver top quartile returns through steady and predicable Utility, Parent & Other earnings growth and dividend growth, while reducing risk, particularly in the volatile commodity-exposed generation business. 
For our customers, deliver top quartile customer satisfaction through anticipating customer needs and exceeding their expectations while keeping rates reasonable. 
For our employees, we're on the top quartile score for organizational health by providing a stable environment with a healthy culture that provides clear direction to our employees and attractive opportunities for career development, and for our communities, where all of us live, maintaining an active role in making things better. This includes helping to bring jobs through economic development, helping ensure we have a trained workforce available to fill those jobs, giving both our time and financial support and operating in a socially and environmentally responsible way. These objectives form the basis of our strategy: Investing in the utility to benefit customers while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predicable investment recovery, providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make these investments, and reducing volatility for our merchant businesses and freeing up resources to invest in other opportunities. This strategy has driven the plan for execution we played out on the 2016 to-do list. From objectives to strategy, all the way through execution, we've made great progress. We have a clear vision for what we still must do. We have the tools in place to do it. We will talk more about this journey at our Analyst Day on June 9. Please mark your calendars now, and we'll have more details as the day gets closer. With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

Today, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, followed by our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018. But before we get into details, the punchline is that our results and expectations remain in line with all that we have discussed with you. 
Now let's jump into 2015. Results for the quarter are summarized on Slide 4 of our presentation. Operational earnings, excluding special items, were $1.58 per share, up from $0.75 a year ago and in line with the expectations we shared last November. Most significant special items include EWC's noncash impairment of our Palisades unit and the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center. Operational earnings for the business increased due to tax items, partially offset by Utility charges, warm weather and low wholesale power prices. 
Looking at Utility, Parent & Other results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share increased quarter-over-quarter. The main driver was income tax as a result of the business combination for the 2 Louisiana operating companies, which was completed in October. This item contributed $1.50 to fourth quarter earnings after reserves to share $107 million with customers. The customer sharing is reflected as a reduction in net revenue. 
Unfavorable weather partially offset the tax items. 
Slide 6 shows our adjusted view of Utility, Parent & Other earnings, which excludes weather and normalizes for income tax items. The adjusted view was lower than the same period a year ago. However, as Leo mentioned, this quarter's result included 2 charges totaling $0.35 per share. Considering those charges, the underlying business was in line with our November expectations. 
Volume increased for both residential, weather-adjusted sales and industrial sales. Our residential growth was 1.6% and sales to industrial customers increased 0.6%, as shown on Slide 7. We continue to see gains for new and expansion projects, adding approximately 300 gigawatt hour or 2.7% to our industrial sales this quarter. However, volume from existing industrial customers declined, due primarily to weakness in the chlor-alkali factor and an extended outage for a key customer, which we mentioned last quarter. Recently, we have also seen weakness in the metals and wood product sectors. 
On the positive side, sales through existing petroleum refining customers increased on higher production due to continued favorable market conditions. 
EWC fourth quarter results are summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.16 in the current quarter, $0.23 lower than the fourth quarter in 2014. The most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet revenue was $44 per megawatt hour this quarter, down from $54 in 2014, excluding Vermont Yankee. Closure of VY contributed $0.05 to the decline. Conversely, the effects of last quarter's impairments reduced fuel, nonfuel O&M and depreciation expenses, which helped earnings $0.14. 
Income tax variance of $0.13 also contributed to the offset. 
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow this quarter, about $50 million lower than the same quarter in 2014. The biggest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC. 
Now I'll quickly go through full year results, summarized on Slide 10. Operational earnings for 2015 were $6 per share, up from $5.83 in 2014, once again in line with the expectations we shared last November. Higher earnings at Utility, Parent & Other drove the increase. 
As shown on Slide 11, Utility, Parent & Other operational earnings shares results were $4.97 in 2015, compared to $3.64 in the prior year, led primarily by the aforementioned income taxed items. 
On Slide 12, adjusted Utility, Parent & Other results came in at $3.08, excluding weather and normalizing for taxes, lower than in 2014. As of the charges, the fourth quarter adjusted EPS would have been $3.43, which was also in line with our previous expectations. 
Slide 13 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which declined year-over-year to $1.03 per share in 2015 from $2.19. Lower prices were the largest driver, accounting for $1.06 of the decline. Another $0.20 was due to Vermont Yankee, and the effects of the impairment provided a $0.14 offset. Full year operating cash flow shown on Slide 14 was just under $3.3 billion in 2015, around $600 million lower than the prior year. The most significant factors were about $300 million of Hurricane Isaac-related securitization funds received in 2014, as well as revenue from our EWC business. 
Now let me wrap up 2015 results. We are initiating 2016 operational earnings guidance. Details on our 2016 assumptions, as well as sensitivities are provided in the appendix of our presentation. Consolidated operational earnings per share guidance is $4.95 to $5.75 per share with a midpoint of $5.35 on Slide 15. We're also issuing an adjusted Utility, Parent & Other guidance range of $4.20 to $4.50 per share with $4.35 midpoint, consistent with our communications since last summer. Recall that our adjusted measure reflects normal weather and statutory taxes. 
The possibility exists for significant tax items this year as early as the second quarter, but there's too much uncertainty to put those possibilities into the guidance at this time. 
Starting with the Utility, Parent & Other just view, we expect $1.27 per share of growth. Rate actions and sales growth are the largest drivers, as well as lower nonfuel O&M and the effects of the 2015 Utility charges. 
Depreciation expense is also expected to increase by about $0.30, including Union. The Union acquisition is expected to contribute a little more than $0.20 to the bottom line in 2016. As you know, we have not closed that transaction yet, and 2016 earnings would be reduced about $0.02 for every month of delay. 
The Arkansas settlement agreement as filed would help Entergy Arkansas move much closer towards allowed return levels. We expect the Arkansas Public Service Commission to issue a decision soon. 
Our industrial sales growth in 2016 continues to be driven by identified new and expansion projects in our service territory, rather than our existing customer base. Approximately 2/3 of our new expansion projects are already in service to continue to reach steady low levels in 2016 and the remaining 1/3 comes from projects that are scheduled to come into service this year, most of which are in the final stages of construction or early stages of testing. 
Nevertheless, these new projects continue to have timing and ramp rate risks, which could impact results. 
Our industrial sales are also exposed to market and commodity risks associated with a broader economy. As a result of these risks, our overall industrial growth expectation of 2016 is now at 2.9%, and overall retail sales growth is at 1.9%. 
We see Utility, nonfuel O&M at about $2.5 billion or about $0.20 lower than 2015, due primarily to pension and OPEC costs, which are expected to decline about $0.29. This includes a slightly higher pension discount rate than we expected to EEI. The change in the discount rate offsets higher ANO Column 4 expenses, now projected to be $50 million in 2016, about flat year-over-year. 
We also anticipate lower expenses for fossil and nuclear in 2016, as well as higher expenses for the Union plant operations. 
Turning to EWC, its guidance midpoint is $1 per share, about the same as the 2015 results. Lower energy and capacity prices are expected to largely offset the effects of impairments recorded in 2015. Effects from the 2015 impairments, which affect multiple line items, are $0.49 per share year-over-year. 
Our guidance, based on year-end prices, assumes average energy and capacity revenue of $48 per megawatt hour. Despite our 86% hedge position, there is $0.25 per share downside of sensitivity to a $10 per megawatt hour drop in prices. The prices have been lower by about $4 since the beginning of the year with the warm winter weather. 
EWC's pension and OPEC expense will also decline about $0.10 year-over-year, offsetting higher Pilgrim Column 4 costs, and inflation effects bring net nonfuel O&M to a little less than $0.10 lower, along with decommissioning trust earnings about $0.10 lower in 2016. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter results, based on what we know today, we're expecting operational earnings generally in line with first quarter consensus of around $1.10 per share. This considers milder weather experience so far this year, including $0.07 of negative effect already in January. And we don't currently anticipate any significant tax items in the first quarter. 
Moving to our longer-term views, Slide 16 shows our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share outlook, which is unchanged since EEI. The foundation for our objective to achieve steady and predictable Utility, Parent & Other growth is rate base growth from the Utility investment plan. The 2016 through 2018 capital plan is about $1.1 billion higher than the preliminary estimates provided at EEI, but primarily because the Union acquisition was delayed into 2016. 
As Leo discussed, our capital outlook is also supported by regulatory mechanisms, which provide increased financial flexibility to execute on capital plans, and by longer-term retail sales growth, which can help mitigate rate effects for our customers. We also see continued O&M improvement as the assumed pension discount rate increases slowly overtime and ANO Column 4 spending rolls off. There could be some level of continued spending to maintain ANO performance improvement upon Column 4 exit or additional costs as a result of the NRC's inspection. We expect any prudently incurred incremental cost to be recoverable. 
The near-term changes to our sales growth for 2016 do not have an impact on our long-term 4% to 5% annual industrial growth expectations through 2018. We continue to see large industrial products coming  online to drive the growth. Overall, our annual retail sales growth is still expected to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which implies residential and commercial as slightly less than 1%. 
Finally, it is important to remember that our capital plan is driven more by our need to modernize our aging infrastructure and maintain reliability and less by our need to support load growth. As a result, our strategic objectives and investment thesis, dividend growth and resulting earnings outlook remain on track. 
Slide 17 provides our EWC outlook for EBITDA with separate estimates for the nuclear plants that are closed or planned to be closed. Current forecast is based on market prices as of year-end. As I mentioned, market prices have declined since that time. One other thing that we closely monitor is our cash and credit position. 
Slide 18 summarizes our cash flow and credit metrics. Efforts focused on improving cash flow and de-risking the business create both value and stability. Our goal is to remain solidly in the investment grade credit rating range for all our rated entities, while we support the growth of the rest of the business. 
Now on the slide, but certainly to remain to the credit position, is our pension liability. Despite a slight negative return on our pension assets in 2015, we were able to improve our funded status by about $250 million. Although many factors impact that number, the reality is that we continue to take sustainable steps to manage our pension obligation in a methodical way. This includes program changes, liability management, efforts and investments in the $800 million over the past 2 years. Over the next 3 years, we expect to contribute over $1.1 billion to our pension trust, including almost $400 million in 2016. 
Before closing, I'd like to acknowledge that David Borde is with us today on the earnings call. We recently announced that David will assume Paula Waters' role as Vice President of Investor Relations in mid-March. You'll have the opportunity to meet David on the road in the coming weeks. David's background on Wall Street, both as a lawyer and an investment banker, makes him as strong fit for the Investor Relations role. He also worked as part of Entergy's corporate development group before becoming a key team member, supporting Theo and the Utility strategy through his role as Director in the utilities and the business partners group. David will continue to pursue the standards of excellence we have described to achieve in our disclosure and our relations with all of you. 
At the same time, Paula is not going far. She has been given new responsibilities within Utility, where she will oversee top line growth strategies, including economic development and revenue forecasting in support of the 5 Utility operating companies. We appreciate Paula's remarkable tenure in Investor Relations as she has been instrumental in helping us clarify our discussions and strengthening our relationships with you, the analyst community. Thank you, Paula. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

I think from our perspective, we'd rank that confidence higher, a little higher than we had say few years ago at the analyst meeting because primary, a lot of the project have advanced relative to that point in time, and also we've gotten a better line of sight on what's really happening from an economic perspective as it relates to what you're seeing with commodity markets. As we talked about at EEI, as you look '15 through '18, basically 95% of that growth of what we call new and expansion projects were related to projects that weren't in advanced stages. And we continue to see that to be the case. That's not to say that we see some projects, smaller projects, maybe falloff as we have gone forward. And if you also recall at EEI, that 95%, about 70% was made up of basically a handful of large projects that were in advanced stages, and those projects, primarily in steel, had an ethene cracker. We did have an LNG project. We also have projects in the ammonia area as well as methanol. So it was spread across a lot of various segments. As we continue to get closer and as we move closer in time to the expected construction, data completion dates for these projects, clearly, we get more visibility around where those projects are, just by the sheer passage of time. I think the other thing that we have gotten more visibility around is what's going on with our existing customers and got more granularity as to what's happening in that particular area, and we don't really see much growth when we talk about the 4% to 5% coming from our existing customer base. But as we've talked about in the past, our existing customers are large industrial customers who are on fixed rate -- fixed demands type contracts and so, while we may see volumetric fluctuations, we really don't see conflicting fluctuations in revenue when you talk about downside situations. So I think our confidence is high. I mean, clearly, as Drew said in the script, there are still extra essential factors that can affect what we're seeing. But we monitor this on a fairly regular basis, and we need to try to get as much intelligence around it as we possibly can, both from a customer perspective, as well as a macroeconomic perspective."

I mean, when we think about growth and kind of the nonindustrial sector for '16, first, I'd start by saying if you look at the quarterly GSP across the Gulf South region, we see numbers probably anywhere from 2.5% to 4% in the '16, '17 timeframe.

Also I think if you look at what we've experienced, even in '15, for the companies within that region, we have residential sales growth ranging from 1.5% to about 3.5% on a weather-adjusted basis. The commercial sales growth basically in the 1% to 2% on a weather-adjusted basis in that area. And so as we look forward, we see, for example, on the commercial side, major projects that happened in '15 that will have a full year effect in '16. That contribute to what we view as a fairly reasonable sales growth expectation in the commercial side. In the residential area, we do -- are seeing pockets of what we call maybe the multiplier effect related to the industrial growth that we see again in that Gulf South, Gulf Coast regional area. And I'd also say that one thing that we could advantage of in 2016 is another day of kilowatt hour sales that have some small impact on our expectation in 2016 as well. So around 1%, which is where we are when you adjust -- when you take out the total growth and the impact of industrial. Again, the macroeconomic effects, we see -- or impacts we could see at the industrial level, we could see at the residential and commercial. But we, as I said in response to Dan's question, we've done a lot of work around updating our expectations relative to that. And at this point, we feel fairly comfortable with where we are."

So a quick question on the capital plan and your point that it's the aging infrastructure that drives the growth and the CapEx, not as much the load growth. But I'm assuming at some point, you do need load growth to kind of maintain your competitive rates and keep that rate and attract more, I guess, CapEx and more load into the region. So what is the minimum load growth that you look at from an industrial perspective, given the decline in load growth at least for 2016. How would you see the load growth out in the future? And is there a minimum level that you would track to say you need that kind of load at least in terms of load growth to support the CapEx plan while keeping the rates in check?"

One thing to keep in mind is, as you look at that capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies, improved -- the heat rate, the cost efficiency, t",849,"So Praful, that's a good question. One thing to keep in mind is, as you look at that capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies, improved -- the heat rate, the cost efficiency, the environmental output of the new plants as those field plants get older and more costly. So as time progresses, certainly, we have the ability to benefit our customers with a more reliable, more environmentally friendly and lower production cost unit. And so we're doing that on a time, just like anyone would. It just so happens that this kind of seems to happen in big chunks in terms of when the facilities are required. So we're in the process of doing that. Recall that we've never been long generation also. So we're short -- we anticipate being short generation out into the middle of the next decade, even with if we were to have significantly lower growth. So the need for the generation will continue to exist and what we've mentioned before is, we have some flexibility around the timing as it relates to the CTs, we have the deactivations of the units and, certainly, PPA's that roll off that are all part of the mix. So it's a combination of the need, but it's also us making sure we have a risk mitigation strategy for the company and for its customers associated with how we put that in place. So I know there is no -- at this industrial load growth number that we would give you that we say we no longer need this investment. But the fact of the matter is we would continue to be short with the ability to be in MISO and utilize the market over time as we go out there. And we really don't see that changing under too many scenarios. The transmission investment is driven in large part by changing reliability requirements, similar type of activity as it relates to new technologies and the ability to improve the operations, so the system as we go forward, plus again, the age of the infrastructure requires some upgrading as well. As does our entry into MISO provide us with the opportunity to make deliverability of assets that before we couldn't into the market going forward as well. So in the transmission that we're doing from a reliability standpoint, a lot of that like the Lake Charles project, a lot of the load that we're going to serve there is already there, so it's beefing up of the reliability, improving the infrastructure plus load growth that we already see under deconstruction. So that's pretty solid as well under a variety of load growth scenarios. And then as we talked about before, we're also embarking on the AMI side of things and as we go forward, there could be other things that would certainly show up, that could either replace things that may or may not fall out or upwards than that capital growth going forward on the distribution side, which is going to become more and more important again in the -- to benefit our customers. So I guess the bottom line here is there is an opportunity for us to continue to invest this capital because of structure is and where the state of the technology is. And we're also managing it in a real risk mitigation kind of strategy, again not getting long on the generation side, not getting out of our skews on the transmission side. And I'd like to make sure that we are well within the balance of anything that might happen on a load growth point of view. But you are right. The main benefits that we have from load growth are that it continues to provide us with that competitive advantage, whereas I mentioned in my script, we're today over 25% below the national average in our rates. That contributes to our ability to attract new business into the region, so that we have the capability to do that more. And so things like the Continental Tire example that I mentioned and all the stuff that's under construction that Leo mentioned, all of those, in addition to us managing our cost levels, the decline in natural gas prices, all of that go to contribute to that, rate advantage continuing and, hopefully, growing over time. And so, you can't really say I want load growth to the capital. It's very robust over a variety of load growth scenarios, but we have to be mindful of the risk mitigation strategies that we would in place when we build those new plants or those CTs, but also the other cost ending that we can do, as it relates to our normal O&M fuel costs and production costs as we've put these new plans in place, for example, that help us maintain that advantage. That's kind of -- it's more complicated than just one number, I guess, would be the answer. But it's pretty robust across a variety of load growth scenarios."

We've spent a lot of time with all those jurisdictions including Arkansas, sitting down with them are jurisdictional CEOs who have done a wonderful job, there are regulatory folks who have done a wonderful job, feels done a wonderful job of making sure that we sit down and find common ground with all of them around bettering the economy of the state. And Charles, I started out with the 4 stakeholders and our objectives for them around first quartile TSR, first quartile customer satisfaction, et cetera. We bring jobs to the state. We do good for the company. We could do good for the community. We could do good for our employees. It's great for the political environment as well. So all we've done is we sat down and discussed that with our regulators, as well as the politicians in our regions to describe to them our desire to participate in that with them and help them achieve their objectives. And so what we've crafted in Texas with riders, in Arkansas with the forward-looking FRP, with Mississippi with the forward features of FRP, the way assets are recovered in Louisiana, New Orleans, et cetera. What we've accomplished with them is that common ground about how giving us the financial flexibility to make you all comfortable with the investments that we have through the regulatory process, helps us attract the Big River Steels, the Sasols of the world, the Continental Tires of the world, to come to our region, to buy power from us, to help us invest in the infrastructure and then create tens of thousands of jobs.

Today, we're reporting fourth quarter operational earnings per share of $1.58, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. It was a good quarter overall, although developments related to resolving lingering risks and uncertainties resulted in a few nonrecurring expenses. Namely, we had 2 regulatory charges in Utility related to longstanding matters and we've reported 2 additional asset impairments, reflecting in the changes in strategic direction for the EWC business. 
With those things now mostly behind us, we've initiated 2016 guidance with the midpoint in line with our expectations. We also affirmed our 2017 and 2018 Utility, Parent & Other financial outlook. 2015 was a pivotal year for us. We accomplished much of what we set out to do, working in the interests of all 4 of our stakeholders. For our customers, we began making investments in our long-term capital plan to continue modernizing our infrastructure and maintain a reliable and efficient system. Meanwhile, we control the overall cost on our customer bills and obtained new legislation and regulatory actions. These accomplishments facilitate our ability to continue improving our service to customers. 
Our employees, we continue to purchase -- to pursue our organizational health initiative, soliciting feedback from our workforce and using it to strengthen our culture and enhance our organization. 
For our communities, we continued our focus on education, putting particular emphasis on workforce development. We began a $5 million 5-year workforce development initiative in partnership with the communities we serve. The first round of grants would be announced soon. We also contributed approximately $3 million throughout 2015 in support of education through organizations such as Teach for America, STEM NOLA, Jobs for America's Graduates and [indiscernible] among others. 
Our employees echoed our commitment, giving more than 95,000 hours of their time to support education and other causes. 
Combined with our work in other areas like assistance to low-income families, these contributions are accomplishing several objectives: we are creating economic activity when trained and educated people enter the workforce; we are creating valuable resources and a competitive advantage for our region, helping to attract new businesses; our efforts work for us as we need new skilled employees; and perhaps most importantly, our efforts provide an opportunity to those that might not otherwise have one, so that the cycle of poverty can be eliminated for a family for generations to come. 
For our owners, we successfully executed on our strategy designed to provide long-term growth and stability, and therefore, increased our dividend by 2.4%, the first increase in more than 5 years. We'll continue working towards our objective of steady, predictable dividend growth. We also strengthened our credit profile, as recognized by the major rating agencies, with several positive changes in the outlooks for our ratings, along with the rating upgrade for Entergy New Orleans by Moody's. 
Nevertheless, in some ways, 2015 was a year of challenges and evolution. Our total shareholder return for 2015 was disappointing. However, our returns since September 30 have placed us second overall among our 20 utility peers. Your positive reaction to successes and other actions since the third quarter of 2015 validates the momentum we see as we move into 2016. 
At EWC, we took steps to reduce volatility and gain clarity on the future of the business. Closing Pilgrim and FitzPatrick was not the path we wanted to take. After pursuing many alternatives, they ultimately were the only options remaining for us. We know they are tough decisions for those involved. And we are committed to supporting our employees who work at these plants and their communities throughout this difficult transition. 
I'll take a moment now to expand more on some of our fourth quarter 2015 accomplishments, beginning with the Utility. I've mentioned the necessity to continue to modernize our infrastructure and maintain a reliable system. To this end, our purchase of Union Power Station has received the necessarily retail regulatory approvals. One last approval was pending from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Upon closing, the purchase of this plant will provide lower cost, reliable generation to our customers for many years to come. 2015 also saw the start of a regulatory process for the St. Charles generation project, a 980-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plant to be constructed in Mound, Louisiana. We've requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of this new modern plant, which will provide economic and reliable power for many years. The targeted in-service date is June of 2019. 
In addition to approval of more than $700 million of transmission investments in all 4 states of our service territory, as part of the mid-continent independent system operator, or MISO, MTEP 15 process, we initiated one of the largest transmission projects in our history. This project includes 2 new substations, expansion of 2 existing substations and 25 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines around the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. It will both enhance reliability for existing customers in that area, as well as support new load in this growing region of Louisiana. Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the Certificate of Public Need and Necessity at its business and executive session in December. We expect construction to begin in the first quarter of 2016. 
Our regulatory frameworks are now better aligned to facilitate future investments to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our system to benefit our customers. We're seeing the results of this improved framework and the settlement of our Arkansas rate case. The settlement reflects a net $133 million base rate increase and a 9.75% authorized return on equity, effective at the end of February. It also sets the framework for the formula rate plan with a future test year in the coming years. The Arkansas Public Service Commission is expected to act on the settlement and issue an order later this month. 
With this new regulatory structure, we will have increased financial flexibility and ability to execute on capital investments, in response to our customers' needs. Affirming this view, Moody's revised EAI's outlook to positive in April, following the adoption of the legislation allowing for a forward test year FRP and the filing of the rate case to use the new FRP. 
Moreover, the new regulatory structure will help Entergy Arkansas support economic expansion, creating jobs for our customers in these communities and spreading fixed costs over more sales and helping to maintain a rate advantage. We will be able to provide similar benefits to our customers in Mississippi as Entergy Mississippi's first FRP with forward-looking features was approved earlier in 2015. In addition, we've been partnering with Mississippi state officials to help bring 2,500 jobs to Hinds County to a $1.45 billion tire plant in our service territory. Mississippi lawmakers approved an incentive package for Continental Tires, one of the top 5 worldwide automotive suppliers, to build a new facility near Clinton. This announcement further demonstrates how Mississippi is a premier location for automotive production, as they join Nissan and Toyota in the state. 
In Texas, we're using some of the new rider mechanisms to provide similar financial flexibility and the ability to support the needs of our customers. We've reached a settlement for an incremental increase to our distribution investment rider of just over $5 million, effective at the start of the year. The Public Utility Commission in Texas approved the settlement last week. We also are nearing completion of the regulatory view of our requests for an incremental $13 million revenue requirement under a similar rider for transmission investment. We expect a proposal for a decision later this month and the commission consideration in March. 
Finally, we reached a milestone on December 29 when we received the final approval from FERC to end the System Agreement among Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas and Entergy New Orleans, the 3 operating companies that remain parties to the agreement.
This is an important step towards simplifying our regulatory structure and reducing risk and uncertainty for us and our customers. It will allow us to put greater focus on the distinct opportunities at each of our retail regulatory jurisdictions as well as our core operations without the distractions from the near constant interregional litigation associated with this agreement. 
Along with our plans for capital investment, we are carefully monitoring the effect of these investments on our customers' bills. Based on the most recent EAI data, our average rates are over 25% below the national average. Historically low natural gas prices also have helped lower customer bills, and are offsetting some increases in base rates. As a result, our customers will continue to benefit from some of the lowest rates in the country while also benefiting from a more modern and efficient electric system. 
Looking back at EWC in the fourth quarter, we've work towards resolution on the future of each of our plants, advancing our strategy to both provide capital to invest in other opportunities and to reduce risk and volatility from this part of our business. 
We closed on the sale of our 583-megawatt Rhode Island CCGT on December 17. This plant was a good investment for us. It's sale now frees up resources we can use to support other opportunities. 
The New York ISO recently determined the retirement of FitzPatrick, when combined with several other facilities, will result in a resource adequacy shortfall in 2019. However, we expect there will be more cost-effective solutions to fill this need. And ISO New England determined that there is no reliability need associated with the Pilgrim retirement in June of 2019. As a result, we will move forward with plans to close both plants. As we've said before, these difficult, yet necessary, steps are not what we wanted.
On a positive note, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued the license amendments for Palisades, reflecting updated guidance, inspection and analysis on the reactor vessel head embrittlement. These amendments confirmed that the plant meets the appropriate criteria to run till the end of its extended license, and will not be forced into an early shutdown. At Indian Point, we continue to pursue license renewal in each of our plants to resolve the Coastal Zone Management Act, and Clean Water Act requirements remains open. 
The NRC confirms that our timely application for renewal enabled the continued operation of the Indian Point, following the original expiration date of the unit's license this past December. Additionally, the NRC issued a draft update to the Indian Point Supplemental and Environmental Impact Statement, which reaffirmed the NRC's previous conclusion that the environmental effects of Indian Point's continued operation are not an obstacle to license renewal. 
And lastly, Vermont Yankee announced that it will be ready to begin the transfer of spent fuel into dry cast starting in 2017, 2 years earlier than originally planned. We are seeking approval from the Vermont Public Service Board for Certificate of Public Good, so we can begin construction of the storage pad to complete the safe transfer into dry storage. 
Now it's time to look to the future. Last year's strategic accomplishments have ultimately set us up to undertake an equally ambitious list for 2016. You can read the list on Slide 3. Several of the items listed are related to closing out the regulatory agenda we began in 2015 and using the tools we have to execute on our capital investment plan. These regulatory items include: the now approved distribution rider and the pending transmission rider filings in Texas, and making our first forward-looking formula rate plan filings in Arkansas and Mississippi; as well as the second combined Entergy Louisiana FRP filing using a 2015 test year. 
Also on our to-do list are steps which help continue to modernize and enhance our Utility system. As I said earlier, we've requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of the St. Charles power station. We will make selections in our request for proposals for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas long-term resources in the coming months. We will begin construction of the Lake Charles Transmission Project, as well as numerous other significant transmission projects. 
Lastly, we continue to move forward with the process for installing smart meters on our Utility system. Smart meters are a foundational investment in the grid modernization opportunity I spoke about at EEI. These types of investments are another way for us to lower cost and improve service for our customers. Some benefits of AMI include operational efficiencies, timely information provided to our customers, so they can better understand and control their usage and faster outage restoration and improved system reliability for our customers. 
The next step involves further engaging our regulators and other stakeholders to discuss this investment and its associated benefits, and we continue to evaluate other investments in the grid that can benefit our customers. 
The operating companies anticipate making regulatory filings where applicable for the smart meter investment between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017. A piece of the 3-year capital plan laid out in our slides today is earmarked for this initiative, and we will share more with you over time on AMI as well as what might be next. 
At EWC, we continue to make plans and preparations for transitioning the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim nuclear plants to the decommissioning phase. At Pilgrim, we will make a decision by midyear on whether to refuel the plant for another 2-year operating cycle. 
I'd like to take a moment to personally thank the more than 1,200 employees at both our Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants for staying focused on continued safe and secure operations. I want to acknowledge their professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition. After all the underlying objective that supports all of the initiatives on the to-do list is the imperative to get the fundamentals right. Without that, nothing else works. That means continuing to deliver safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers at the lowest reasonable costs. 
These actions, combined with our other ongoing initiatives, will contribute towards meeting our objectives in the interest of all 4 of our stakeholders. That is the execution of the journey we set out on 3 years ago. We have set clear objectives to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. For owners, deliver top quartile returns through steady and predicable Utility, Parent & Other earnings growth and dividend growth, while reducing risk, particularly in the volatile commodity-exposed generation business. 
For our customers, deliver top quartile customer satisfaction through anticipating customer needs and exceeding their expectations while keeping rates reasonable. 
For our employees, we're on the top quartile score for organizational health by providing a stable environment with a healthy culture that provides clear direction to our employees and attractive opportunities for career development, and for our communities, where all of us live, maintaining an active role in making things better. This includes helping to bring jobs through economic development, helping ensure we have a trained workforce available to fill those jobs, giving both our time and financial support and operating in a socially and environmentally responsible way. These objectives form the basis of our strategy: investing in the utility to benefit customers while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predicable investment recovery; providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make these investments; and reducing volatility for our merchant businesses and freeing up resources to invest in other opportunities. This strategy has driven the plan for execution we played out on the 2016 to-do list. From objectives to strategy, all the way through execution, we've made great progress. We have a clear vision for what we still must do. We have the tools in place to do it. We will talk more about this journey at our Analyst Day on June 9. Please mark your calendars now, and we'll have more details as the day gets closer. With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

Today, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, followed by our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018. But before we get into details, the punchline is that our results and expectations remain",2095,"Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, followed by our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018. But before we get into details, the punchline is that our results and expectations remain in line with all that we have discussed with you. 
Now let's jump into 2015. Results for the quarter are summarized on Slide 4 of our presentation. Operational earnings, excluding special items, were $1.58 per share, up from $0.75 a year ago and in line with the expectations we shared last November. Most significant special items include EWC's noncash impairment of our Palisades unit and the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center. Operational earnings for the business increased due to tax items, partially offset by Utility charges, warm weather and low wholesale power prices. 
Looking at Utility, Parent & Other results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share increased quarter-over-quarter. The main driver was income tax as a result of the business combination for the 2 Louisiana operating companies, which was completed in October. This item contributed $1.50 to fourth quarter earnings after reserves to share $107 million with customers. The customer sharing is reflected as a reduction in net revenue. 
Unfavorable weather partially offset the tax items. 
Slide 6 shows our adjusted view of Utility, Parent & Other earnings, which excludes weather and normalizes for income tax items. The adjusted view was lower than the same period a year ago. However, as Leo mentioned, this quarter's result included 2 charges totaling $0.35 per share. Considering those charges, the underlying business was in line with our November expectations. 
Volume increased for both residential, weather-adjusted sales and industrial sales. Our residential growth was 1.6% and sales to industrial customers increased 0.6%, as shown on Slide 7. We continue to see gains for new and expansion projects, adding approximately 300 gigawatt hour or 2.7% to our industrial sales this quarter. However, volume from existing industrial customers declined, due primarily to weakness in the chlor-alkali factor and an extended outage for a key customer, which we mentioned last quarter. Recently, we have also seen weakness in the metals and wood product sectors. 
On the positive side, sales through existing petroleum refining customers increased on higher production due to continued favorable market conditions. 
EWC fourth quarter results are summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.16 in the current quarter, $0.23 lower than the fourth quarter in 2014. The most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet revenue was $44 per megawatt hour this quarter, down from $54 in 2014, excluding Vermont Yankee. Closure of VY contributed $0.05 to the decline. Conversely, the effects of last quarter's impairments reduced fuel, nonfuel O&M and depreciation expenses, which helped earnings $0.14. 
Income tax variance of $0.13 also contributed to the offset. 
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow this quarter, about $50 million lower than the same quarter in 2014. The biggest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC. 
Now I'll quickly go through full year results, summarized on Slide 10. Operational earnings for 2015 were $6 per share, up from $5.83 in 2014, once again in line with the expectations we shared last November. Higher earnings at Utility, Parent & Other drove the increase. 
As shown on Slide 11, Utility, Parent & Other operational earnings shares results were $4.97 in 2015, compared to $3.64 in the prior year, led primarily by the aforementioned income taxed items. 
On Slide 12, adjusted Utility, Parent & Other results came in at $3.08, excluding weather and normalizing for taxes, lower than in 2014. As of the charges, the fourth quarter adjusted EPS would have been $3.43, which was also in line with our previous expectations. 
Slide 13 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which declined year-over-year to $1.03 per share in 2015 from $2.19. Lower prices were the largest driver, accounting for $1.06 of the decline. Another $0.20 was due to Vermont Yankee, and the effects of the impairment provided a $0.14 offset. Full year operating cash flow shown on Slide 14 was just under $3.3 billion in 2015, around $600 million lower than the prior year. The most significant factors were about $300 million of Hurricane Isaac-related securitization funds received in 2014, as well as revenue from our EWC business. 
Now that we've wrapped up 2015 results, we are initiating 2016 operational earnings guidance. Details on our 2016 assumptions, as well as sensitivities are provided in the appendix of our presentation. Consolidated operational earnings per share guidance is $4.95 to $5.75 per share with a midpoint of $5.35 on Slide 15. We're also issuing an adjusted Utility, Parent & Other guidance range of $4.20 to $4.50 per share with $4.35 midpoint, consistent with our communications since last summer. Recall that our adjusted measure reflects normal weather and statutory taxes. 
The possibility exists for significant tax items this year as early as the second quarter, but there's too much uncertainty to put those possibilities into the guidance at this time. 
Starting with the Utility, Parent & Other just view, we expect $1.27 per share of growth. Rate actions and sales growth are the largest drivers, as well as lower nonfuel O&M and the effects of the 2015 Utility charges. 
Depreciation expense is also expected to increase by about $0.30, including Union. The Union acquisition is expected to contribute a little more than $0.20 to the bottom line in 2016. As you know, we have not closed that transaction yet, and 2016 earnings would be reduced about $0.02 for every month of delay. 
The Arkansas settlement agreement as filed would help Entergy Arkansas move much closer towards allowed return levels. We expect the Arkansas Public Service Commission to issue a decision soon. 
Our industrial sales growth in 2016 continues to be driven by identified new and expansion projects in our service territory, rather than our existing customer base. Approximately 2/3 of our new expansion projects are already in service to continue to reach steady load levels in 2016 and the remaining 1/3 comes from projects that are scheduled to come into service this year, most of which are in the final stages of construction or early stages of testing. 
Nevertheless, these new projects continue to have timing and ramp rate risks, which could impact results. 
Our industrial sales are also exposed to market and commodity risks associated with a broader economy. As a result of these risks, our overall industrial growth expectation of 2016 is now at 2.9%, and overall retail sales growth is at 1.9%. 
We see Utility, nonfuel O&M at about $2.5 billion or about $0.20 lower than 2015, due primarily to pension and OPEC costs, which are expected to decline about $0.29. This includes a slightly higher pension discount rate than we expected to EEI. The change in the discount rate offsets higher ANO Column 4 expenses, now projected to be $50 million in 2016, about flat year-over-year. 
We also anticipate lower expenses for fossil and nuclear in 2016, as well as higher expenses for the Union plant operations. 
Turning to EWC, its guidance midpoint is $1 per share, about the same as the 2015 results. Lower energy and capacity prices are expected to largely offset the effects of impairments recorded in 2015. Effects from the 2015 impairments, which affect multiple line items, are $0.49 per share year-over-year. 
Our guidance, based on year-end prices, assumes average energy and capacity revenue of $48 per megawatt hour. Despite our 86% hedge position, there is $0.25 per share downside of sensitivity to a $10 per megawatt hour drop in prices. The prices have been lower by about $4 since the beginning of the year with the warm winter weather. 
EWC's pension and OPEC expense will also decline about $0.10 year-over-year, offsetting higher Pilgrim Column 4 costs, and inflation effects bring net nonfuel O&M to a little less than $0.10 lower, along with decommissioning trust earnings about $0.10 lower in 2016. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter results, based on what we know today, we're expecting operational earnings generally in line with first quarter consensus of around $1.10 per share. This considers milder weather experience so far this year, including $0.07 of negative effect already in January. And we don't currently anticipate any significant tax items in the first quarter. 
Moving to our longer-term views, Slide 16 shows our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share outlook, which is unchanged since EEI. The foundation for our objective to achieve steady and predictable Utility, Parent & Other growth is rate base growth from the Utility investment plan. The 2016 through 2018 capital plan is about $1.1 billion higher than the preliminary estimates provided at EEI, but primarily because the Union acquisition was delayed into 2016. 
As Leo discussed, our capital outlook is also supported by regulatory mechanisms, which provide increased financial flexibility to execute on capital plans, and by longer-term retail sales growth, which can help mitigate rate effects for our customers. We also see continued O&M improvement as the assumed pension discount rate increases slowly overtime and ANO Column 4 spending rolls off. There could be some level of continued spending to maintain ANO performance improvement upon Column 4 exit or additional costs as a result of the NRC's inspection. We expect any prudently incurred incremental cost to be recoverable. 
The near-term changes to our sales growth for 2016 do not have an impact on our long-term 4% to 5% annual industrial growth expectations through 2018. We continue to see large industrial products coming  online to drive the growth. Overall, our annual retail sales growth is still expected to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which implies residential and commercial as slightly less than 1%. 
Finally, it is important to remember that our capital plan is driven more by our need to modernize our aging infrastructure and maintain reliability and less by our need to support load growth. As a result, our strategic objectives and investment thesis, dividend growth and resulting earnings outlook remain on track. 
Slide 17 provides our EWC outlook for EBITDA with separate estimates for the nuclear plants that are closed or planned to be closed. Current forecast is based on market prices as of year-end. As I mentioned, market prices have declined since that time. One other thing that we closely monitor is our cash and credit position. 
Slide 18 summarizes our cash flow and credit metrics. Efforts focused on improving cash flow and de-risking the business create both value and stability. Our goal is to remain solidly in the investment grade credit rating range for all our rated entities, while we support the growth of the rest of the business. 
Now on the slide, but certainly germane to the credit position, is our pension liability. Despite a slight negative return on our pension assets in 2015, we were able to improve our funded status by about $250 million. Although many factors impact that number, the reality is that we continue to take sustainable steps to manage our pension obligation in a methodical way. This includes: program changes, liability management, efforts and investments in the $800 million over the past 2 years; over the next 3 years, we expect to contribute over $1.1 billion to our pension trust, including almost $400 million in 2016. 
Before closing, I'd like to acknowledge that David Borde is with us today on the earnings call. We recently announced that David will assume Paula Waters' role as Vice President of Investor Relations in mid-March. You'll have the opportunity to meet David on the road in the coming weeks. David's background on Wall Street, both as a lawyer and an investment banker, makes him as strong fit for the Investor Relations role. He also worked as part of Entergy's corporate development group before becoming a key team member, supporting Theo and the Utility strategy through his role as Director in the utilities and the business partners group. David will continue to pursue the standards of excellence we have described to achieve in our disclosure and our relations with all of you. 
At the same time, Paula is not going far. She has been given new responsibilities within Utility, where she will oversee top line growth strategies, including economic development and revenue forecasting in support of the 5 Utility operating companies. We appreciate Paula's remarkable tenure in Investor Relations as she has been instrumental in helping us clarify our discussions and strengthening our relationships with you, the analyst community. Thank you, Paula. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

I think from our perspective, we'd rank that confidence higher, a little higher than we had say few years ago at the analyst meeting because primary, a lot of the project have advanced relative to that point in time, and also we've gotten a better line of sight on what's really happening from an economic perspective as it relates to what you're seeing with commodity markets. As we talked about at EEI, as you look '15 through '18, basically 95% of that growth of what we call New and Expansion Projects were related to projects that weren't in advanced stages. And we continue to see that to be the case. That's not to say that we see some projects, smaller projects, maybe falloff as we have gone forward. And if you also recall at EEI, that 95%, about 70% was made up of basically a handful of large projects that were in advanced stages, and those projects were primarily in steel, had an ethene cracker. We did have an LNG project. We also have projects in the ammonia area as well as methanol. So it was spread across a lot of various segments. As we continue to get closer and as we move closer in time to the expected construction, data completion dates for these projects, clearly, we get more visibility around where those projects are, just by the sheer passage of time. I think the other thing that we have gotten more visibility around is what's going on with our existing customers and got more granularity as to what's happening in that particular area, and we don't really see much growth when we talk about the 4% to 5% coming from our existing customer base. But as we've talked about in the past, our existing customers are large industrial customers who are on fixed rate -- fixed demands type contracts and so, while we may see volumetric fluctuations, we really don't see conflicting fluctuations in revenue when you talk about downside situations. So I think our confidence is high. I mean, clearly, as Drew said in the script, there are still extra essential factors that can affect what we're seeing. But we monitor this on a fairly regular basis, and we need to try to get as much intelligence around it as we possibly can, both from a customer perspective, as well as a macroeconomic perspective."

Also I think if you look at what we've experienced, even in '15, for the companies within that region, we have residential sales growth ranging from 1.5% to about 3.5% on a weather-adjusted basis. The commercial sales growth basically in the 1% to 2% on a weather-adjusted basis in that area. And so as we look forward, we see, for example, on the commercial side, major projects that happened in '15 that have a full year effect in '16, that contribute to what we view as a fairly reasonable sales growth expectation in the commercial side. In the residential area, we do -- are seeing pockets of what we call maybe the multiplier effect related to the industrial growth that we see again in that Gulf South, Gulf Coast regional area. And I'd also say that one thing that we took advantage of in 2015 is another day of kilowatt hour sales that have some small impact on our expectation in 2016 as well. So around 1%, which is where we are when you adjust -- when you take out the total growth and the impact of industrial. Again, the macroeconomic effects, we see -- or impacts we could see at the industrial level, we could see at the residential and commercial. But we, as I said in response to Dan's question, we've done a lot of work around updating our expectations relative to that. And at this point, we feel fairly comfortable with where we are."

So a quick question on the capital plan and your point that it's the aging infrastructure that drives the growth and the CapEx, not as much the load growth. But I'm assuming at some point, you do need load growth to kind of maintain your competitive rates and keep that rate and attract more, I guess, CapEx and more load into the region. So what is the minimum load growth that you look at from an industrial perspective? Given the decline in load growth at least for 2016, how would you see the load growth out in the future? And is there a minimum level that you would track to say you need that kind of load at least in terms of load growth to support the CapEx plan while keeping the rates in check?"

One thing to keep in mind is, as you look at that capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies improve the heat rate, the cost efficiency, the en",848,"So Praful, that's a good question. One thing to keep in mind is, as you look at that capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies improve the heat rate, the cost efficiency, the environmental output of the new plants as those field plants get older and more costly. So as time progresses, certainly, we have the ability to benefit our customers with a more reliable, more environmentally friendly and lower production cost unit. And so we're doing that on a time, just like anyone would. It just so happens that this kind of seems to happen in big chunks in terms of when facilities are required. So we're in the process of doing that. Recall that we've never been long generation also. So we're short -- we anticipate being short generation out into the middle of the next decade, even with if we were to have significantly lower growth. So the need for the generation will continue to exist and what we've mentioned before is, we have some flexibility around the timing as it relates to the CTs, we have the deactivations of the units and, certainly, PPA's that roll off that are all part of the mix. So it's a combination of the need, but it's also us making sure we have a risk mitigation strategy for the company and for its customers associated with how we put that in place. So I know there is no -- at this industrial load growth number that we would give you that we say we no longer need this investment. But the fact of the matter is we would continue to be short with the ability to be in MISO and utilize the market over time as we go out there. And we really don't see that changing under too many scenarios. The transmission investment is driven in large part by changing reliability requirements, similar type of activity as it relates to new technologies and the ability to improve the operations, so the system as we go forward plus, again, the age of the infrastructure requires some upgrading as well. As does our entry into MISO provide us with the opportunity to make deliverability of assets that before we couldn't into the market going forward as well. So in the transmission that we're doing from a reliability standpoint, a lot of that like the Lake Charles project, a lot of the load that we're going to serve there is already there, so it's a beefing up of in reliability, improving the infrastructure plus load growth that we already see under deconstruction. So that's pretty solid as well under a variety of load growth scenarios. And then as we talked about before, we're also embarking on the AMI side of things and as we go forward, there could be other things that would certainly show up, that could either replace things that may or may not fall out or upwards in that capital growth going forward on the distribution side, which is going to become more and more important, again, in the -- to benefit our customers. So I guess the bottom line here is there is an opportunity for us to continue to invest this capital because of structure is and where the state of the technology is. And we're also managing it in a real risk mitigation kind of strategy, again not getting long on the generation side, not getting out of our skews on the transmission side and the like to make sure that we are well within the bounds of anything that might happen on a load growth point of view. But you are right. The main benefits that we have from load growth are that it continues to provide us with that competitive advantage; whereas I mentioned in my script, we're today over 25% below the national average in our rates. That contributes to our ability to attract new business into the region, so that we have the capability to do that more. And so things like the Continental Tire example that I mentioned and all the stuff that's under construction that Leo mentioned, all of those, in addition to us managing our cost levels, the decline in natural gas prices, all of that go to contribute to that, rate advantage continuing and, hopefully, growing over time. And so, you can't really say I want load growth to the capital. It's very robust over a variety of load growth scenarios, but we have to be mindful of the risk mitigation strategies that we would in place when we build those new plants or those CTs, but also the other cost ending that we can do, as it relates to our normal O&M fuel costs and production costs as we've put these new plans in place, for example, that help us maintain that advantage. That's kind of -- it's more complicated than just one number, I guess, would be the answer. But it's pretty robust across a variety of load growth scenarios."

We're all interested in growing the economies with the jurisdictions in the states, in which we operate, and same with the city of New Orleans. We've spent a lot of time with all those jurisdictions including Arkansas, sitting down with them are jurisdictional CEOs who have done a wonderful job, there are regulatory folks who have done a wonderful job, Theo's done a wonderful job of making sure that we sit down and find common ground with all of them around bettering the economy of the state. And Charles, I started out with the 4 stakeholders and our objectives for them around first quartile TSR, first quartile customer satisfaction, et cetera. We bring jobs to the state. We do good for the company. We could do good for the community. We could do good for our employees. It's great for the political environment as well. So all we've done is we sat down and discussed that with our regulators, as well as the politicians in our regions to describe to them our desire to participate in that with them and help them achieve their objectives. And so what we've crafted in Texas with riders, in Arkansas with the forward-looking FRP, with Mississippi with the forward features of FRP, the way assets are recovered in Louisiana, New Orleans, et cetera. What we've accomplished with them is that common ground about how giving us the financial flexibility to make you all comfortable with the investments that we have through the regulatory process, helps us attract the Big River Steels, the Sasols of the world, the Continental Tires of the world, to come to our region, to buy power from us, to help us invest in the infrastructure and then create tens of thousands of jobs. We're working on this together to be able to do that. So I wouldn't say that anybody won the day in Arkansas other than the State of Arkansas. And we participated in that in a small way and they worked together with us to create something that allowed us to do that. And I would say that it's no different than the workforce development program that I mentioned in my script. We're spending $5 million over the next 5 years to help train people to work at those plants that we've helped detract. And that's good for all 4 of our stakeholders as well, as we do that. So it really has been the last few years of extraordinary collaboration, four site-buyer [ph] regulators and us listening to them as much as them listening to us."

Today, we're reporting fourth quarter operational earnings per share of $1.58, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. It was a good quarter overall, although developments related to resolving lingering risks and uncertainties resulted in a few nonrecurring expenses. Namely, we had 2 regulatory charges in Utility related to longstanding matters and we've reported 2 additional asset impairments, reflecting in the changes in strategic direction for the EWC business. 
With those things now mostly behind us, we've initiated 2016 guidance with the midpoint in line with our expectations. We also affirmed our 2017 and 2018 Utility, Parent & Other financial outlook. 2015 was a pivotal year for us. We accomplished much of what we set out to do, working in the interests of all 4 of our stakeholders. For our customers, we began making investments in our long-term capital plan to continue modernizing our infrastructure and maintain a reliable and efficient system. Meanwhile, we control the overall cost on our customer bills and obtained new legislation and regulatory actions. These accomplishments facilitate our ability to continue improving our service to customers. 
Our employees, we continue to purchase -- to pursue our organizational health initiative, soliciting feedback from our workforce and using it to strengthen our culture and enhance our organization. 
For our communities, we continued our focus on education, putting particular emphasis on workforce development. We began a $5 million 5-year workforce development initiative in partnership with the communities we serve. The first round of grants would be announced soon. We also contributed approximately $3 million throughout 2015 in support of education through organizations such as Teach for America, STEM NOLA, Jobs for America's Graduates and [indiscernible] among others. 
Our employees echoed our commitment, giving more than 95,000 hours of their time to support education and other causes. 
Combined with our work in other areas like assistance to low-income families, these contributions are accomplishing several objectives: we are creating economic activity when trained and educated people enter the workforce; we are creating valuable resources and a competitive advantage for our region, helping to attract new businesses; our efforts work for us as we need new skilled employees; and perhaps most importantly, our efforts provide an opportunity to those that might not otherwise have one, so that the cycle of poverty can be eliminated for a family for generations to come. 
For our owners, we successfully executed on our strategy designed to provide long-term growth and stability, and therefore, increased our dividend by 2.4%, the first increase in more than 5 years. We'll continue working towards our objective of steady, predictable dividend growth. We also strengthened our credit profile, as recognized by the major rating agencies, with several positive changes in the outlooks for our ratings, along with the rating upgrade for Entergy New Orleans by Moody's. 
Nevertheless, in some ways, 2015 was a year of challenges and evolution. Our total shareholder return for 2015 was disappointing. However, our returns since September 30 have placed us second overall among our 20 utility peers. Your positive reaction to successes and other actions since the third quarter of 2015 validates the momentum we see as we move into 2016. 
At EWC, we took steps to reduce volatility and gain clarity on the future of the business. Closing Pilgrim and FitzPatrick was not the path we wanted to take. After pursuing many alternatives, they ultimately were the only options remaining for us. We know they are tough decisions for those involved. And we are committed to supporting our employees who work at these plants and their communities throughout this difficult transition. 
I'll take a moment now to expand more on some of our fourth quarter 2015 accomplishments, beginning with the Utility. I've mentioned the necessity to continue to modernize our infrastructure and maintain a reliable system. To this end, our purchase of Union Power Station has received the necessarily retail regulatory approvals. One last approval was pending from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Upon closing, the purchase of this plant will provide lower cost, reliable generation to our customers for many years to come. 2015 also saw the start of a regulatory process for the St. Charles generation project, a 980-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plant to be constructed in Mound, Louisiana. We've requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of this new modern plant, which will provide economic and reliable power for many years. The targeted in-service date is June of 2019. 
In addition to approval of more than $700 million of transmission investments in all 4 states of our service territory, as part of the mid-continent independent system operator, or MISO, MTEP 15 process, we initiated one of the largest transmission projects in our history. This project includes 2 new substations, expansion of 2 existing substations and 25 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines around the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. It will both enhance reliability for existing customers in that area, as well as support new load in this growing region of Louisiana. Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the Certificate of Public Need and Necessity at its business and executive session in December. We expect construction to begin in the first quarter of 2016. 
Our regulatory frameworks are now better aligned to facilitate future investments to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our system to benefit our customers. We're seeing the results of this improved framework and the settlement of our Arkansas rate case. The settlement reflects a net $133 million base rate increase and a 9.75% authorized return on equity, effective at the end of February. It also sets the framework for the formula rate plan with a future test year in the coming years. The Arkansas Public Service Commission is expected to act on the settlement and issue an order later this month. 
With this new regulatory structure, we will have increased financial flexibility and ability to execute on capital investments, in response to our customers' needs. Affirming this view, Moody's revised EAI's outlook to positive in April, following the adoption of the legislation allowing for a forward test year FRP and the filing of the rate case to use the new FRP. 
Moreover, the new regulatory structure will help Entergy Arkansas support economic expansion, creating jobs for our customers in these communities and spreading fixed costs over more sales and helping to maintain a rate advantage. We will be able to provide similar benefits to our customers in Mississippi as Entergy Mississippi's first FRP with forward-looking features was approved earlier in 2015. In addition, we've been partnering with Mississippi state officials to help bring 2,500 jobs to Hinds County to a $1.45 billion tire plant in our service territory. Mississippi lawmakers approved an incentive package for Continental Tires, one of the top 5 worldwide automotive suppliers, to build a new facility near Clinton. This announcement further demonstrates how Mississippi is a premier location for automotive production, as they join Nissan and Toyota in the state. 
In Texas, we're using some of the new rider mechanisms to provide similar financial flexibility and the ability to support the needs of our customers. We've reached a settlement for an incremental increase to our distribution investment rider of just over $5 million, effective at the start of the year. The Public Utility Commission in Texas approved the settlement last week. We also are nearing completion of the regulatory view of our requests for an incremental $13 million revenue requirement under a similar rider for transmission investment. We expect a proposal for a decision later this month and the commission consideration in March. 
Finally, we reached a milestone on December 29 when we received the final approval from FERC to end the System Agreement among Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas and Entergy New Orleans, the 3 operating companies that remain parties to the agreement.
This is an important step towards simplifying our regulatory structure and reducing risk and uncertainty for us and our customers. It will allow us to put greater focus on the distinct opportunities at each of our retail regulatory jurisdictions as well as our core operations without the distractions from the near constant interregional litigation associated with this agreement. 
Along with our plans for capital investment, we are carefully monitoring the effect of these investments on our customers' bills. Based on the most recent EAI data, our average rates are over 25% below the national average. Historically low natural gas prices also have helped lower customer bills, and are offsetting some increases in base rates. As a result, our customers will continue to benefit from some of the lowest rates in the country while also benefiting from a more modern and efficient electric system. 
Looking back at EWC in the fourth quarter, we've work towards resolution on the future of each of our plants, advancing our strategy to both provide capital to invest in other opportunities and to reduce risk and volatility from this part of our business. 
We closed on the sale of our 583-megawatt Rhode Island CCGT on December 17. This plant was a good investment for us. It's sale now frees up resources we can use to support other opportunities. 
The New York ISO recently determined the retirement of FitzPatrick, when combined with several other facilities, will result in a resource adequacy shortfall in 2019. However, we expect there will be more cost-effective solutions to fill this need. And ISO New England determined that there is no reliability need associated with the Pilgrim retirement in June of 2019. As a result, we will move forward with plans to close both plants. As we've said before, these difficult, yet necessary, steps are not what we wanted.
On a positive note, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued the license amendments for Palisades, reflecting updated guidance, inspection and analysis on the reactor vessel head embrittlement. These amendments confirmed that the plant meets the appropriate criteria to run till the end of its extended license, and will not be forced into an early shutdown. At Indian Point, we continue to pursue license renewal in each of our plants to resolve the Coastal Zone Management Act, and Clean Water Act requirements remains open. 
The NRC confirms that our timely application for renewal enabled the continued operation of the Indian Point, following the original expiration date of the unit's license this past December. Additionally, the NRC issued a draft update to the Indian Point Supplemental and Environmental Impact Statement, which reaffirmed the NRC's previous conclusion that the environmental effects of Indian Point's continued operation are not an obstacle to license renewal. 
And lastly, Vermont Yankee announced that it will be ready to begin the transfer of spent fuel into dry cast starting in 2017, 2 years earlier than originally planned. We are seeking approval from the Vermont Public Service Board for Certificate of Public Good, so we can begin construction of the storage pad to complete the safe transfer into dry storage. 
Now it's time to look to the future. Last year's strategic accomplishments have ultimately set us up to undertake an equally ambitious list for 2016. You can read the list on Slide 3. Several of the items listed are related to closing out the regulatory agenda we began in 2015 and using the tools we have to execute on our capital investment plan. These regulatory items include: the now approved distribution rider and the pending transmission rider filings in Texas, and making our first forward-looking formula rate plan filings in Arkansas and Mississippi; as well as the second combined Entergy Louisiana FRP filing using a 2015 test year. 
Also on our to-do list are steps which help continue to modernize and enhance our Utility system. As I said earlier, we've requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of the St. Charles power station. We will make selections in our request for proposals for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas long-term resources in the coming months. We will begin construction of the Lake Charles Transmission Project, as well as numerous other significant transmission projects. 
Lastly, we continue to move forward with the process for installing smart meters on our Utility system. Smart meters are a foundational investment in the grid modernization opportunity I spoke about at EEI. These types of investments are another way for us to lower cost and improve service for our customers. Some benefits of AMI include operational efficiencies, timely information provided to our customers, so they can better understand and control their usage and faster outage restoration and improved system reliability for our customers. 
The next step involves further engaging our regulators and other stakeholders to discuss this investment and its associated benefits, and we continue to evaluate other investments in the grid that can benefit our customers. 
The operating companies anticipate making regulatory filings where applicable for the smart meter investment between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017. A piece of the 3-year capital plan laid out in our slides today is earmarked for this initiative, and we will share more with you over time on AMI as well as what might be next. 
At EWC, we continue to make plans and preparations for transitioning the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim nuclear plants to the decommissioning phase. At Pilgrim, we will make a decision by midyear on whether to refuel the plant for another 2-year operating cycle. 
I'd like to take a moment to personally thank the more than 1,200 employees at both our Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants for staying focused on continued safe and secure operations. I want to acknowledge their professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition. After all the underlying objective that supports all of the initiatives on the to-do list is the imperative to get the fundamentals right. Without that, nothing else works. That means continuing to deliver safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers at the lowest reasonable costs. 
These actions, combined with our other ongoing initiatives, will contribute towards meeting our objectives in the interest of all 4 of our stakeholders. That is the execution of the journey we set out on 3 years ago. We have set clear objectives to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. For owners, deliver top quartile returns through steady and predicable Utility, Parent & Other earnings growth and dividend growth, while reducing risk, particularly in the volatile commodity-exposed generation business. 
For our customers, deliver top quartile customer satisfaction through anticipating customer needs and exceeding their expectations while keeping rates reasonable. 
For our employees, we're on the top quartile score for organizational health by providing a stable environment with a healthy culture that provides clear direction to our employees and attractive opportunities for career development, and for our communities, where all of us live, maintaining an active role in making things better. This includes helping to bring jobs through economic development, helping ensure we have a trained workforce available to fill those jobs, giving both our time and financial support and operating in a socially and environmentally responsible way. These objectives form the basis of our strategy: investing in the utility to benefit customers while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predicable investment recovery; providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make these investments; and reducing volatility for our merchant businesses and freeing up resources to invest in other opportunities. This strategy has driven the plan for execution we played out on the 2016 to-do list. From objectives to strategy, all the way through execution, we've made great progress. We have a clear vision for what we still must do. We have the tools in place to do it. We will talk more about this journey at our Analyst Day on June 9. Please mark your calendars now, and we'll have more details as the day gets closer. With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

Today, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, followed by our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018. But before we get into details, the punchline is that our results and expectations remain",2095,"Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, followed by our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018. But before we get into details, the punchline is that our results and expectations remain in line with all that we have discussed with you. 
Now let's jump into 2015. Results for the quarter are summarized on Slide 4 of our presentation. Operational earnings, excluding special items, were $1.58 per share, up from $0.75 a year ago and in line with the expectations we shared last November. Most significant special items include EWC's noncash impairment of our Palisades unit and the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center. Operational earnings for the business increased due to tax items, partially offset by Utility charges, warm weather and low wholesale power prices. 
Looking at Utility, Parent & Other results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share increased quarter-over-quarter. The main driver was income tax as a result of the business combination for the 2 Louisiana operating companies, which was completed in October. This item contributed $1.50 to fourth quarter earnings after reserves to share $107 million with customers. The customer sharing is reflected as a reduction in net revenue. 
Unfavorable weather partially offset the tax items. 
Slide 6 shows our adjusted view of Utility, Parent & Other earnings, which excludes weather and normalizes for income tax items. The adjusted view was lower than the same period a year ago. However, as Leo mentioned, this quarter's result included 2 charges totaling $0.35 per share. Considering those charges, the underlying business was in line with our November expectations. 
Volume increased for both residential, weather-adjusted sales and industrial sales. Our residential growth was 1.6% and sales to industrial customers increased 0.6%, as shown on Slide 7. We continue to see gains for new and expansion projects, adding approximately 300 gigawatt hour or 2.7% to our industrial sales this quarter. However, volume from existing industrial customers declined, due primarily to weakness in the chlor-alkali factor and an extended outage for a key customer, which we mentioned last quarter. Recently, we have also seen weakness in the metals and wood product sectors. 
On the positive side, sales through existing petroleum refining customers increased on higher production due to continued favorable market conditions. 
EWC fourth quarter results are summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.16 in the current quarter, $0.23 lower than the fourth quarter in 2014. The most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet revenue was $44 per megawatt hour this quarter, down from $54 in 2014, excluding Vermont Yankee. Closure of VY contributed $0.05 to the decline. Conversely, the effects of last quarter's impairments reduced fuel, nonfuel O&M and depreciation expenses, which helped earnings $0.14. 
Income tax variance of $0.13 also contributed to the offset. 
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow this quarter, about $50 million lower than the same quarter in 2014. The biggest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC. 
Now I'll quickly go through full year results, summarized on Slide 10. Operational earnings for 2015 were $6 per share, up from $5.83 in 2014, once again in line with the expectations we shared last November. Higher earnings at Utility, Parent & Other drove the increase. 
As shown on Slide 11, Utility, Parent & Other operational earnings shares results were $4.97 in 2015, compared to $3.64 in the prior year, led primarily by the aforementioned income taxed items. 
On Slide 12, adjusted Utility, Parent & Other results came in at $3.08, excluding weather and normalizing for taxes, lower than in 2014. As of the charges, the fourth quarter adjusted EPS would have been $3.43, which was also in line with our previous expectations. 
Slide 13 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which declined year-over-year to $1.03 per share in 2015 from $2.19. Lower prices were the largest driver, accounting for $1.06 of the decline. Another $0.20 was due to Vermont Yankee, and the effects of the impairment provided a $0.14 offset. Full year operating cash flow shown on Slide 14 was just under $3.3 billion in 2015, around $600 million lower than the prior year. The most significant factors were about $300 million of Hurricane Isaac-related securitization funds received in 2014, as well as revenue from our EWC business. 
Now that we've wrapped up 2015 results, we are initiating 2016 operational earnings guidance. Details on our 2016 assumptions, as well as sensitivities are provided in the appendix of our presentation. Consolidated operational earnings per share guidance is $4.95 to $5.75 per share with a midpoint of $5.35 on Slide 15. We're also issuing an adjusted Utility, Parent & Other guidance range of $4.20 to $4.50 per share with $4.35 midpoint, consistent with our communications since last summer. Recall that our adjusted measure reflects normal weather and statutory taxes. 
The possibility exists for significant tax items this year as early as the second quarter, but there's too much uncertainty to put those possibilities into the guidance at this time. 
Starting with the Utility, Parent & Other just view, we expect $1.27 per share of growth. Rate actions and sales growth are the largest drivers, as well as lower nonfuel O&M and the effects of the 2015 Utility charges. 
Depreciation expense is also expected to increase by about $0.30, including Union. The Union acquisition is expected to contribute a little more than $0.20 to the bottom line in 2016. As you know, we have not closed that transaction yet, and 2016 earnings would be reduced about $0.02 for every month of delay. 
The Arkansas settlement agreement as filed would help Entergy Arkansas move much closer towards allowed return levels. We expect the Arkansas Public Service Commission to issue a decision soon. 
Our industrial sales growth in 2016 continues to be driven by identified new and expansion projects in our service territory, rather than our existing customer base. Approximately 2/3 of our new expansion projects are already in service to continue to reach steady load levels in 2016 and the remaining 1/3 comes from projects that are scheduled to come into service this year, most of which are in the final stages of construction or early stages of testing. 
Nevertheless, these new projects continue to have timing and ramp rate risks, which could impact results. 
Our industrial sales are also exposed to market and commodity risks associated with a broader economy. As a result of these risks, our overall industrial growth expectation of 2016 is now at 2.9%, and overall retail sales growth is at 1.9%. 
We see Utility, nonfuel O&M at about $2.5 billion or about $0.20 lower than 2015, due primarily to pension and OPEC costs, which are expected to decline about $0.29. This includes a slightly higher pension discount rate than we expected to EEI. The change in the discount rate offsets higher ANO Column 4 expenses, now projected to be $50 million in 2016, about flat year-over-year. 
We also anticipate lower expenses for fossil and nuclear in 2016, as well as higher expenses for the Union plant operations. 
Turning to EWC, its guidance midpoint is $1 per share, about the same as the 2015 results. Lower energy and capacity prices are expected to largely offset the effects of impairments recorded in 2015. Effects from the 2015 impairments, which affect multiple line items, are $0.49 per share year-over-year. 
Our guidance, based on year-end prices, assumes average energy and capacity revenue of $48 per megawatt hour. Despite our 86% hedge position, there is $0.25 per share downside of sensitivity to a $10 per megawatt hour drop in prices. The prices have been lower by about $4 since the beginning of the year with the warm winter weather. 
EWC's pension and OPEC expense will also decline about $0.10 year-over-year, offsetting higher Pilgrim Column 4 costs, and inflation effects bring net nonfuel O&M to a little less than $0.10 lower, along with decommissioning trust earnings about $0.10 lower in 2016. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter results, based on what we know today, we're expecting operational earnings generally in line with first quarter consensus of around $1.10 per share. This considers milder weather experience so far this year, including $0.07 of negative effect already in January. And we don't currently anticipate any significant tax items in the first quarter. 
Moving to our longer-term views, Slide 16 shows our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share outlook, which is unchanged since EEI. The foundation for our objective to achieve steady and predictable Utility, Parent & Other growth is rate base growth from the Utility investment plan. The 2016 through 2018 capital plan is about $1.1 billion higher than the preliminary estimates provided at EEI, but primarily because the Union acquisition was delayed into 2016. 
As Leo discussed, our capital outlook is also supported by regulatory mechanisms, which provide increased financial flexibility to execute on capital plans, and by longer-term retail sales growth, which can help mitigate rate effects for our customers. We also see continued O&M improvement as the assumed pension discount rate increases slowly overtime and ANO Column 4 spending rolls off. There could be some level of continued spending to maintain ANO performance improvement upon Column 4 exit or additional costs as a result of the NRC's inspection. We expect any prudently incurred incremental cost to be recoverable. 
The near-term changes to our sales growth for 2016 do not have an impact on our long-term 4% to 5% annual industrial growth expectations through 2018. We continue to see large industrial products coming  online to drive the growth. Overall, our annual retail sales growth is still expected to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which implies residential and commercial as slightly less than 1%. 
Finally, it is important to remember that our capital plan is driven more by our need to modernize our aging infrastructure and maintain reliability and less by our need to support load growth. As a result, our strategic objectives and investment thesis, dividend growth and resulting earnings outlook remain on track. 
Slide 17 provides our EWC outlook for EBITDA with separate estimates for the nuclear plants that are closed or planned to be closed. Current forecast is based on market prices as of year-end. As I mentioned, market prices have declined since that time. One other thing that we closely monitor is our cash and credit position. 
Slide 18 summarizes our cash flow and credit metrics. Efforts focused on improving cash flow and de-risking the business create both value and stability. Our goal is to remain solidly in the investment grade credit rating range for all our rated entities, while we support the growth of the rest of the business. 
Now on the slide, but certainly germane to the credit position, is our pension liability. Despite a slight negative return on our pension assets in 2015, we were able to improve our funded status by about $250 million. Although many factors impact that number, the reality is that we continue to take sustainable steps to manage our pension obligation in a methodical way. This includes: program changes, liability management, efforts and investments in the $800 million over the past 2 years; over the next 3 years, we expect to contribute over $1.1 billion to our pension trust, including almost $400 million in 2016. 
Before closing, I'd like to acknowledge that David Borde is with us today on the earnings call. We recently announced that David will assume Paula Waters' role as Vice President of Investor Relations in mid-March. You'll have the opportunity to meet David on the road in the coming weeks. David's background on Wall Street, both as a lawyer and an investment banker, makes him as strong fit for the Investor Relations role. He also worked as part of Entergy's corporate development group before becoming a key team member, supporting Theo and the Utility strategy through his role as Director in the utilities and the business partners group. David will continue to pursue the standards of excellence we have described to achieve in our disclosure and our relations with all of you. 
At the same time, Paula is not going far. She has been given new responsibilities within Utility, where she will oversee top line growth strategies, including economic development and revenue forecasting in support of the 5 Utility operating companies. We appreciate Paula's remarkable tenure in Investor Relations as she has been instrumental in helping us clarify our discussions and strengthening our relationships with you, the analyst community. Thank you, Paula. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

I think from our perspective, we'd rank that confidence higher, a little higher than we had say few years ago at the analyst meeting because primary, a lot of the project have advanced relative to that point in time, and also we've gotten a better line of sight on what's really happening from an economic perspective as it relates to what you're seeing with commodity markets. As we talked about at EEI, as you look '15 through '18, basically 95% of that growth of what we call New and Expansion Projects were related to projects that weren't in advanced stages. And we continue to see that to be the case. That's not to say that we see some projects, smaller projects, maybe falloff as we have gone forward. And if you also recall at EEI, that 95%, about 70% was made up of basically a handful of large projects that were in advanced stages, and those projects were primarily in steel, had an ethane cracker. We did have an LNG project. We also have projects in the ammonia area as well as methanol. So it was spread across a lot of various segments. As we continue to get closer and as we move closer in time to the expected construction, data completion dates for these projects, clearly, we get more visibility around where those projects are, just by the sheer passage of time. I think the other thing that we have gotten more visibility around is what's going on with our existing customers and got more granularity as to what's happening in that particular area, and we don't really see much growth when we talk about the 4% to 5% coming from our existing customer base. But as we've talked about in the past, our existing customers are large industrial customers who are on fixed rate -- fixed demands type contracts and so, while we may see volumetric fluctuations, we really don't see conflicting fluctuations in revenue when you talk about downside situations. So I think our confidence is high. I mean, clearly, as Drew said in the script, there are still extra essential factors that can affect what we're seeing. But we monitor this on a fairly regular basis, and we need to try to get as much intelligence around it as we possibly can, both from a customer perspective, as well as a macroeconomic perspective."

I mean, when we think about growth and kind of the nonindustrial sector for '16, first, I'd start by saying if you look at the quarterly GSP across the Gulf South region, we see numbers probably anywhere from 2.5% to 4% in the '16, '17 timeframe.

Also I think if you look at what we've experienced, even in '15, for the companies within that region, we have residential sales growth ranging from 1.5% to about 3.5% on a weather-adjusted basis. The commercial sales growth basically in the 1% to 2% on a weather-adjusted basis in that area. And so as we look forward, we see, for example, on the commercial side, major projects that happened in '15 that have a full year effect in '16, that contribute to what we view as a fairly reasonable sales growth expectation in the commercial side. In the residential area, we do -- are seeing pockets of what we call maybe the multiplier effect related to the industrial growth that we see again in that Gulf South, Gulf Coast regional area. And I'd also say that one thing that we took advantage of in 2015 is another day of kilowatt hour sales that have some small impact on our expectation in 2016 as well. So around 1%, which is where we are when you adjust -- when you take out the total growth and the impact of industrial. Again, the macroeconomic effects, we see -- or impacts we could see at the industrial level, we could see at the residential and commercial. But we, as I said in response to Dan's question, we've done a lot of work around updating our expectations relative to that. And at this point, we feel fairly comfortable with where we are."

But I'm assuming at some point, you do need load growth to kind of maintain your competitive rates and keep that rate and attract more, I guess, CapEx and more load into the region. So what is the minimum load growth that you look at from an industrial perspective? Given the decline in load growth at least for 2016, how would you see the load growth out in the future? And is there a minimum level that you would track to say you need that kind of load at least in terms of load growth to support the CapEx plan while keeping the rates in check?"

One thing to keep in mind is, as you look at that capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies improve the heat rate, the cost efficiency, the en",848,"So Praful, that's a good question. One thing to keep in mind is, as you look at that capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies improve the heat rate, the cost efficiency, the environmental output of the new plants as those field plants get older and more costly. So as time progresses, certainly, we have the ability to benefit our customers with a more reliable, more environmentally friendly and lower production cost unit. And so we're doing that on a time, just like anyone would. It just so happens that this kind of seems to happen in big chunks in terms of when facilities are required. So we're in the process of doing that. Recall that we've never been long generation also. So we're short -- we anticipate being short generation out into the middle of the next decade, even with if we were to have significantly lower growth. So the need for the generation will continue to exist and what we've mentioned before is, we have some flexibility around the timing as it relates to the CTs, we have the deactivations of the units and, certainly, PPA's that roll off that are all part of the mix. So it's a combination of the need, but it's also us making sure we have a risk mitigation strategy for the company and for its customers associated with how we put that in place. So I know there is no -- at this industrial load growth number that we would give you that we say we no longer need this investment. But the fact of the matter is we would continue to be short with the ability to be in MISO and utilize the market over time as we go out there. And we really don't see that changing under too many scenarios. The transmission investment is driven in large part by changing reliability requirements, similar type of activity as it relates to new technologies and the ability to improve the operations, so the system as we go forward plus, again, the age of the infrastructure requires some upgrading as well. As does our entry into MISO provide us with the opportunity to make deliverability of assets that before we couldn't into the market going forward as well. So in the transmission that we're doing from a reliability standpoint, a lot of that like the Lake Charles project, a lot of the load that we're going to serve there is already there, so it's a beefing up of in reliability, improving the infrastructure plus load growth that we already see under deconstruction. So that's pretty solid as well under a variety of load growth scenarios. And then as we talked about before, we're also embarking on the AMI side of things and as we go forward, there could be other things that would certainly show up, that could either replace things that may or may not fall out or upwards in that capital growth going forward on the distribution side, which is going to become more and more important, again, in the -- to benefit our customers. So I guess the bottom line here is there is an opportunity for us to continue to invest this capital because of structure is and where the state of the technology is. And we're also managing it in a real risk mitigation kind of strategy, again not getting long on the generation side, not getting out of our skews on the transmission side and the like to make sure that we are well within the bounds of anything that might happen on a load growth point of view. But you are right. The main benefits that we have from load growth are that it continues to provide us with that competitive advantage; whereas I mentioned in my script, we're today over 25% below the national average in our rates. That contributes to our ability to attract new business into the region, so that we have the capability to do that more. And so things like the Continental Tire example that I mentioned and all the stuff that's under construction that Leo mentioned, all of those, in addition to us managing our cost levels, the decline in natural gas prices, all of that go to contribute to that, rate advantage continuing and, hopefully, growing over time. And so, you can't really say I want load growth to the capital. It's very robust over a variety of load growth scenarios, but we have to be mindful of the risk mitigation strategies that we would in place when we build those new plants or those CTs, but also the other cost ending that we can do, as it relates to our normal O&M fuel costs and production costs as we've put these new plans in place, for example, that help us maintain that advantage. That's kind of -- it's more complicated than just one number, I guess, would be the answer. But it's pretty robust across a variety of load growth scenarios."

We've spent a lot of time with all those jurisdictions including Arkansas, sitting down with them are jurisdictional CEOs who have done a wonderful job, there are regulatory folks who have done a wonderful job, Theo's done a wonderful job of making sure that we sit down and find common ground with all of them around bettering the economy of the state. And Charles, I started out with the 4 stakeholders and our objectives for them around first quartile TSR, first quartile customer satisfaction, et cetera. We bring jobs to the state. We do good for the company. We could do good for the community. We could do good for our employees. It's great for the political environment as well. So all we've done is we sat down and discussed that with our regulators, as well as the politicians in our regions to describe to them our desire to participate in that with them and help them achieve their objectives. And so what we've crafted in Texas with riders, in Arkansas with the forward-looking FRP, with Mississippi with the forward features of FRP, the way assets are recovered in Louisiana, New Orleans, et cetera. What we've accomplished with them is that common ground about how giving us the financial flexibility to make you all comfortable with the investments that we have through the regulatory process, helps us attract the Big River Steels, the Sasols of the world, the Continental Tires of the world, to come to our region, to buy power from us, to help us invest in the infrastructure and then create tens of thousands of jobs. We're working on this together to be able to do that. So I wouldn't say that anybody won the day in Arkansas other than the State of Arkansas. And we participated in that in a small way and they worked together with us to create something that allowed us to do that. And I would say that it's no different than the workforce development program that I mentioned in my script. We're spending $5 million over the next 5 years to help train people to work at those plants that we've helped detract. And that's good for all 4 of our stakeholders as well, as we do that. So it really has been the last few years of extraordinary collaboration, four site-buyer [ph] regulators and us listening to them as much as them listening to us."

We accomplish what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station; finalized our Arkansas rate case; received a final order in our distribution cost recover factor filing in Texas; filed our first FRP with forward-looking features in Mississippi; completed the ANO NRC inspection; received confirmation from the New York ISO that the shutdown of Fitzpatrick will not affect reliability in the region; saw over 6% industrial sales growth versus last year; and today, we are reporting first quarter operational earnings per share of a $1.35, above what we expected.
While that's a good start, we're also aware that it's early in the year and we face challenges ahead. But we're confident that we can manage these and deliver on our earnings commitments for the year as well as our adjusted Utility, Parent And Other long-term outlook. Our results for this quarter or the outcome of the strategy we've been pursuing for some time to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders in 2016 and beyond. At the utility, investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, which provides the financial flexibility we need to make these investments.
And at EWC, continuing to reduce our footprint to limit exposure from assets not supported by the market. We have already materially reduced our size, risk and volatility through the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center and the shut down of Vermont Yankee. This trend will accelerate as Pilgrim and Fitzpatrick come off line. We will continue to saf operations, regulatory compliance and commercial diligence at all sites.
If you turn your attention to our to-do list on Slide 3. On March 3, we closed the acquisition of the Union Power Station. This acquisition is both an important driver in achieving our 2016 earnings expectation, and also one more important step in our broader plan to modernize our fleet and provide a lower cost reliable generation for our customers. Recovery of the cost of this investment in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans effectively began simultaneously with the transactions close, thanks to a collaborative agreement between our team, our regulators and other participants who recognized the benefits of this investment for our customers.
Another important component of our supply plan is building the St. Charles power station. Hearing at the LPSC began April 18 and is expected to conclude today. Thus we expect that the LPSC will be able to take up the certification decision in August. This is an important investment to serve our customers in the Louisiana, and is an example of the infrastructure development that we're undertaking to position the utility for the future.
Beyond generation, we also continue to make significant progress on providing benefits through our transmission investments. We officially kicked off Louisiana late transmission project with a wire cutting ceremony in March. Once completed, this $159 million project will support continued reliability and service to our rapidly growing area in our service territory. On the regulatory front, we've also made progress towards better aligning the timing of our investments with the needs of our customers going forward. This is will improve access to the capital needed to make the investments required to enhance the reliability and capability of our system and provide a lower cost more environmentally-friendly resources of generation for the benefit of our customers.
This ultimately supports economic development on our service territory, which strengthens communities, create jobs and brings more financial stability to the regions we support. This quarter, we filed or concluded several major proceedings. First, we received the final order our Arkansas rate case and rate adjustments began effective on February 24. We will make our first rate plan filing in July under the new framework using a future test year, which will bring more and strength to Arkansas financial profile. This new regulatory structure is the result of collaboration among a broad group of stakeholders and will help us be a stronger partner to attract jobs and economic expansion to Arkansas. Last month, Moody's acknowledged this view with an upgrade to Entergy Arkansas' long-term rating. Entergy Mississippi also began to utilize it's new formula rate plan with forward-looking features, made its first filing on March 15. The filing reflects an anticipated earned ROE for the 2016 test year, that is below the FRP bandwidth, indicating a $32.6 million rate increased to a point within the FRP bandwidth that reflects a 9.96% earned ROE.
A final order on that filing is expected before the end of the second quarter with the resulting rate adjustment to become an effective around midyear.
And in February, the administrative law judge issued a proposal for a decision that the Public Utility Commission of Texas on our transition cost recovery filing. Based on the proposal for decision, we estimate $10 million to $11 million annual recovery on transmissions spend incremental to base rates. Use of this rider along with the distribution cost rider we've been utilizing since January of 2016, will bring us greater financial flexibility to support the needs of our customers in Texas.
Louisiana commission also recently opened 2 generic dockets on income tax and corporate structure questions. The dockets were initiated in response to specific commissioner concerns regarding the transaction and the implications of that transaction structure on taxes and rate making. While the dockets were generic that effect all LPSC jurisdiction utilities, we believe that the scope of the documents will be narrowly focused on those types of structures that gave rise to the dockets and not on broader policy issues like tax normalization or tax-related matters previously approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Furthermore, we've worked constructively and transparently with the LPSC on tax-related matters. The LPSC is familiar with our tax provision, which have resulted in significant benefits to our customers.
The commission has 2 items regarding the transaction on its business and executive session agenda on April 28, and we're hopeful that it will take that opportunity to clarify the scope of these dockets. We do not expect significant effects for ELL as a result of these dockets.
Finally, we carefully monitored the effects of investments and rate actions on our customer builds, which today remain on average 20% to 25% below the national average. In fact, our average residential rates remain below $0.10 per kilowatt hour.
Looking forward, we continue to explore solutions that will meet our customers changing expectations in the evolving landscape of the utility industry. By introducing new technologies and renewable energy resources, we can build a cleaner, more resilient and affordable and provides innovative opportunities in the way we interact to generate power for the benefit of all of our customers.
We're active on the front with solar power programs in Mississippi, New Orleans and Arkansas. Entergy Mississippi has completed 3 solar installations in 3 different locations, each capable of generating 500 kilowatts. Entergy New Orleans has begun construction of the 1 megawatt solar generation project with state-of-the-art battery storage Technology. And Entergy Arkansas has entered into a power purchase agreement with facilitate construction of 81-megawatt solar generating facility, which could be online as early as 2018.
These are the first steps towards assessing feasibility of utility scale solar generation, a resource that provides one way to help meet our voluntary commitment to stabilize our carbon dioxide emissions and reduce our environmental footprint.
At the same time, in 2015, our existing generating fleet continue to produce electricity at one of the lowest carbon dioxide emission rates in the United States. We are building on this pilot programs and we've initiated 3 new request for proposals for renewable side generation resources to help meet long-term resource planning objectives in our service territory. These RFPs are seeking up to 200 megawatts of capacity for Louisiana, 100 megawatts for Arkansas and 20 megawatts for New Orleans. The on-pilot programs would also created a commercial development and innovation team dedicated to evaluating and integrating other new technologies in our operating model. That team focuses on addressing customer needs and expectations through product and service innovation, technology deployment and alternative service models and will also research and develop the enabling technologies that enhance the distribution grid and provide a higher service and reliability for all of our customers.
For example, as I mentioned last quarter, we are moving forward with the process to install advanced meters in our distribution system. At our Analyst Day in June, we will give you more details next steps for deployments of advanced meters and similar to our approach for our supply plan back in 2014, we'll provide initial stroke around broader plans for other potential grid modernization efforts to be followed with more details over time.
I would take a moment now to talk about initiatives to improve our nuclear operations.
First of all, our plants are safe. If they weren't, they would not be running. But this past year, the performance of nuclear fleet as a whole was not in line with our standards. Operational excellence is integral to our business model and a core competency we must maintain to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. We've made it a priority in 2016 to strengthen the culture of operational excellence throughout our organization. I would like to extend my thanks to Tim Mitchell, who started this down this path who is our interim Chief Nuclear Officer, and welcome Chris Morgan, who has officially joined us as Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Reporting directly to me, Chris will now lead these efforts in the nuclear organization. In January, as part of a comprehensive fleet wide performance plan, we formed a corporate event response team with industry assistance around best practices and increased engagement with all stakeholders. We are evaluating nuclear operations across our fleet from top to bottom and we continue to evaluate the need for process changes at each individual client. And its not just about column four, our main long-term objective is sustained operational excellence across our fleet.
This could result in incremental nuclear spending, and we're working hard to mitigate any financial implications. At ANO, NRC completed supplemental inspection and announced those results at a public meeting earlier this month. The NRC is confident that the problems have been identified and a comprehensive plan is being implemented to correct them. The NRC is expected to issue a confirmatory action letter in the next several weeks, when we plan to give you an update at Analyst Day.
Finally, it's a important to emphasize that the NRC did recognize that the plan is safe to continue power operations, and the actions taken today, have further improved the margin of safety at ANO, but at all of our nuclear facilities. is also working toward process improvement in the NRC will supplementary inspection in that plant and will focus on the corrective action program that resulted in entry into column 4 and a safety culture assessment. We will inform you when we're ready for that inspection, which we expect to be in the second half of this year.
Also, after careful consideration of the circumstances surrounding the plant's operations, we intend to refuel the plant in the spring of 2017, and run the plant safety to its current capacity market commitments with the ISO of England until the plant shut down date of May 21, 2019.
And in the we are committed to resolving performance deficiencies, ensuring recovery in plant performance. We performed and completed comprehensive inspections during our planned refueling needed to. We detected additional work involving which will fully addressed -- we will fully address before we starting the plant. Subject to the completion of engineering analysis, we expect to be done with the additional work and have the plant back online around late June. Finally, we remain focused on safety operating the battery plant through January 27, 2017, followed by a safe shutdown and eventual decommissioning of the facility. The decision to shut down assets are very difficult. And we're proud of our employees who remain focused on safe operations and finishing strong.
I reiterate our commitment to support them and the communities affected by the difficult decisions we've made for these plants. Speaking of the communities we serve, we recognize that we plan important role as a corporate citizen in every region where we operate, and our core values resonate in the ways we support our communities. Improving educational and economic opportunities for customers in our communities, is one way we demonstrate our commitment. As part of a five-year $5 million initiative to support workforce development training, we made a $250,000 grant for jobs for America's graduates. This program equips at youth with the skills needed to transition successfully to careers or college, addressing critical workforce needs, closing skills gaps and creating a competitive advantage for local communities.
The benefits program like this are long-lasting in finding opportunities for those who might not otherwise have some, and helping to raise the standard of living for a family for generations to come. We've also made a two-year $450,000 grant to Red Cross to support our disaster response in our communities. Recent floods damaged really 13,000 loans in Louisiana, and the damages is still being assessed from this month floodns in Texas, highlighting the importance of a fast response in times of disaster.
Through our partnership with the Red Cross, Entergy is able to direct funds to communities following storms or other disasters as they are needed, allowing help to be provided more quickly to those in need. I'm also proud of our initiatives, which help us maintain a diverse and engaged workforce. Veterans and active make valuable contributions to our company in recognition of our average to support National Guard and reserve members, we've been selected as a finalist for 2016 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. We're pleased to be considered for this honor, and we appreciate the sacrifice that these employees and their families make in their service to our country, as well as the unique skills and experiences that they bring to Entergy. These are just some of the efforts that got us ranked top quartile in Corporate Responsibility magazine's annual list of the 100 best corporate citizens. This is the 7th time we've been included on this list, which recognizes companies taking sustainable, responsible actions in areas such as employee relations, philanthropy and community support, environment and climate change.
Nowhere are these qualities are more important -- apparent that where our employees go above and beyond to serve our customers during their most difficult times. Many of you may have seen or read about the significant flooding in our service territory this quarter. Though our system withstood the conditions quite well, our employees where also very diligent in safely restoring powers to those that needed, repairing damages infrastructure and even saving lives.
I'm excited about all that we've done so far in 2016 to execute on our strategy. This quarter was a good start to the year. The major undertakings we've completed will help drive our 2016 results. We're also aware of the challenges ahead and more work needs to be done to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Everything we do is designed to support our objective to create value for each of our four stakeholders. We strive to deliver top quartile returns for our owners, provide top quartile satisfaction for our customers, achieve top quartile organization scores and top decile safety performance for our employees and maintain an active role in supporting our communities by achieving top decile performance for corporate social responsibility.
With these objectives in mind, we remain focused on the strategy we've developed to achieve those objectives. Steadily grow the utility by investing the benefit customers while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital with timely and predictable investment recovery providing the strength and flexibility we need to make those investments, and continue to reduce the EWC footprint while ensuring safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial due diligence for our assets.
We are off to a good start and we will continue to execute through the remainder of the year on the plans that we've laid out. With that, I will turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the results for the quarter. Turning to Slide 4, our operational earnings, excluding special items, were of $1.35 per share, higher than we expected. This compares to a $1.68 the year ago. This quarter's results vary from last year due to the effect of weather and a 2015 income tax item at utility and lower wholesale power prices at EWC. These declines were partially offset by growth in the utility business.
In both periods, as reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants as we've identified the close. This special items are for severance and retention costs as well as capital spending, which has been expensed. 
Turning to utility and other results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share decreased $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. However, the adjusted Slide 6, which excludes the effects of weather and income tax items, increased $0.19.
The growth in our base business is a result of our efforts in the last year to execute on our strategy to make productive investment to benefit customers and improve returns in our operating companies. Consistent with that strategy, Entergy Arkansas rate case is an important driver for the quarterly results. Rate adjustments were effective starting February 24, and included recovery for the Union Power Station acquisition. In addition, the final order allowed the deferral of $0.06 of previously expensed and compliance cost, which we collected over 10 years.
Combined, these items contributed about $0.15 to this quarter's earnings. A second driver of note, with improved efforts to manage nonfuel O&M expense, which decreased to $0.07 after excluding a deferral I just noted. The scope for spending and benefit costs including pension were over, while nuclear spending increased. This quarter, we also recorded a charge of approximately $0.05 associated with quarters in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding, which came out last Thursday.
The charge represents a portion of EAI's estimated liability that would be attributable to its wholesale business and is not recoverable. This is a complex and technical skills that continues on at the FERC, and it's ultimate outcome is uncertain. We will provide additional details in our Form 10-Q.
Turning to sales. We also saw earnings contribution from over 6% industrial sales growth. Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the increase. About 70% of this quarter's increase came from new and expansion customers across several sectors as they continue to ramp and come online. Higher sales to existing customers were driven by petroleum refiners at fewer and shorter outages progress industrials sales growth in the quarter. This is expected to continue into 2Q.
Growth in new and expansion customers are also expected to continue through the rest of the year. However, given our strong refiners ran in the second half of last year and expected and changes in operational levels later this year, we expect additional growth to be weighted towards the first half of 2016.
Turning to EWC's first quarter results summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.51 in the current quarter, $0.20 lower than the prior year. The single most significant factor was lower sale prices. The nuclear fleet average price was down more than $8 per megawatt hour or 13%. In addition, we realized on decommissioning trust decline to last years rebalancing activity for VY trust, which resulted in higher interest income in 2015. On the other hand, the effect of last year's impairments reduced fuel -- nuclear refueling outage and depreciation expenses, which benefited earnings approximately $0.16 this quarter.
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow for this quarter of $553 million. That $80 million lower than the same quarter in 2015. The largest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 10. As of today, we see adjusted utility and other earnings at our guidance midpoint. Recall, this excludes the effects of any weather or tax items.
For our consolidated guidance, we must also consider negative weather to date, EWC price declines since year-end and extended outage at Indian Point unit 2. For IP 2, we've not yet completed our engineering analysis, but based on information to-date, our preliminary estimate is that the extended hours will reduce earnings by approximately $0.20. This is primarily from lost revenue, but also includes a higher refueling outage cost, which we currently estimate to be around $20 million.
The higher outage cost will be amortized over the life of the outage with the bulk of the earnings effect in 2017.
Looking at a balance of the year, there are additional risks and opportunities that could apply to both utility, parent and other as well as Entergy overall. As Leo mentioned, we have the potential for higher nuclear spending as we execute on our nuclear performance improvement plan. As always, there are potential risk to our sales forecast. We also see opportunities to mitigate these challenges or provide upside, starting with the management of our spending, some of which began in the first quarter.
In addition, as a measure never last quarterly call, there is potential for income tax items, possibly as early as second quarter of this year. Considering all these factors, we're affirming our guidance for the year. Moving to our longer-term view, Slide 11 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook, which is unchanged, some of the challenges and opportunities that we've noted for '16, exist on an ongoing basis and uncertainty for pension expenses but also with the added benefit of efficient regulatory mechanism. Our strategy to realize these results remains the same as we focus on making projective investments to benefit customers, while mating competitive rates with timely and predictable investment recovery.
Slide 12 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook assuming market prices as of March 31. One thing to note, is the root cause analysis being both issues could prompt an accelerated inspection schedule for unit 3 in India Point. This is not reflected in our current estimates, and we plan to provide more information once our analysis is complete.
Before closing, I would like to give you a little bit detail on our Analyst Day on June 9 in New York City in Midtown. We will talk about what's next for Entergy and utility growth opportunity before us. We will also provide some longer-term 5-year views and more detail on our nuclear improvement plan.

So we actually were about $0.07, $0.08 ahead at EWC versus our previous expectation. The balance of that at utility. Some of it was the -- or the bulk of the O&M savings that we saw above expectation were in the fossil area as we came through the outage season, we actually did much better than we had historically. And then the balance of it, as you referenced, there was some conservatism built into the Arkansas rate case. So we -- that was justified right at the very end, we did lose $5 million of comp, but that spread out differently than we built the into our case. Some of those Fukushima and flood barrier cost were not part of our expectation for the quarter but they were able to stay in a final order. And then, some timing elements were for the period between February 24 and April 1 went in our favor, but they our overall expectation. So that's more of a timing shift between periods.

So while I do agree it was fairly low the first quarter, it was a little bit lower than expectations, but it wasn't necessarily a big surprise to us. And as we go forward throughout the year, we expect to see that, the comeback as you look at gross products in the regions that we serve, particularly Louisiana and Texas, we see that starting to kind of sell out and begin to trend upward, and we think that will help move those growth rate back to a more typical level.

And we've done that at Vermont Yankee and Fitzpatrick to follow. The plans that aren't supported by the market, that are no longer fit the portfolio. As far as the operating plan, just  I think Indian Point in Palisades and together, you will certainly currently today, they are not in the same situation as the other platns as far as being cash flow positive. If they're not operating versus the cash flow positive if they are. Remember when we made these decisions around those facilities, we looked at 3 different things. One, what's the NPV of the facilities, is it negative or positive. Two, what's the near-term cash flow burn rate, positive or negative? And three, how does change of risk profile as the company, I think we achieved our objectives with all of those, including the right sale around that. And we continue to evaluate the other plants in this similar matter. The difference being, obviously, the PPA supports the cost structure at the aides and the market supports the cost structure at Indian Point. As far as any kind of opportunities that we would have around those facilities outside of the decisions we've already made, I can't really comment and would weren't comment on that. Just because once you start down that path, our strategy or our policy is just not comment on those sorts of things. But like I said, we looking at those in the same way, from an NPV, cash flow and risk standpoint, what are our options with those facilities. And we will pick the one that we believe creates the best value for our shareholders. And again, is the NPV positive to run versus alternative become, that will be a major driver. Cash flow positive or negative, particularly in the near term or one of those alternatives to run the plant. And third, does it change the risk profile? And obviously, our view is making our footprint smaller does improve the risk profile of the company. And then the Last thing we always have to look at is the execution opportunity is it something similar to what I discussed on the question around M&A. There is a lot of things that we would do, but we have to make sure anything we do is executable both with the counterparty, our own point of view, and through the regulatory process."

If economics could have been different, and we've -- for example, we've been promoting a clean energy standard in New York that would include nuclear plants for several years. And the reason obviously that we do is one is the right thing from a public policy standpoint. And it certainly the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint, from an energy price standpoint the market for liabilities the whole 9 yards. And we've been promoting it for a number of years, because obviously these things must take their course in the regulatory arena and then in the legislation -- legislative it's regulatory or the courts. And obviously, you can always expect there to be intervention into anything that comes up and these things just take a long time to develop. And so, right now, there is no, nothing in place. We don't know if there was something in place, what it we it would be. We don't know, if you do how restructured, what it will provide. We don't know if what it provided would be enough to support the economics of the plant. And we don't know that the timing of it could ever been done before we had to make the decision to go ahead and refuel, which then would come into several hundred million dollars of losses. So we're out of time. It's not that we're against the proposals in terms of on their face, other than I would say that obviously, we believe there is a clean energy standard in New York that concludes nuclear -- it should include all of the nuclear plants. And we for their efforts, because we think that's the right thing to do, or we wouldn't have been proposing for the last couple of years. I mean, you hit the nail on the head on this point of no return aspect. Its not in place. We don't know what it is. We don't know what it will provide. We don't know what the economics would be. For it to run its course, again, we unfortunately, we like are out of time. So anything that says we're opposed to a clean energy standard and the like, we are not. We've been those all along. Again, we do think this should incorporate all plants in the state. We would be all plants in the country actually to be consistent. But right now, there is nothing in place that we could look at, that would provide us the opportunity to change our decision."

This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy. We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station;",2791,"Thank you, David., and good morning, everyone. This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy. We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station; finalized our Arkansas rate case; received a final order in our distribution cost recovery factor filing in Texas; filed our first FRP with forward-looking features in Mississippi; completed the ANO NRC inspection; received confirmation from the New York ISO that the shutdown of Fitzpatrick will not affect reliability in the region; saw over 6% industrial sales growth versus last year; and today, we are reporting first quarter operational earnings per share of a $1.35, above what we expected.
While that's a good start, we're also aware that it's early in the year and we'd face challenges ahead. But we're confident that we can manage these and deliver on our earnings commitments for the year as well as our adjusted Utility, Parent And Other long-term outlook. Our results for this quarter are the outcome of the strategy we have been pursuing for some time to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders in 2016 and beyond. At the utility, investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, which provides the financial flexibility we need to make these investments, and at EWC, continuing to reduce our footprint to limit exposure from assets not supported by the market. We've already materially reduced our size, risk and volatility through the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center and the shutdown of Vermont Yankee. This trend will only accelerate as Pilgrim and Fitzpatrick come offline. We will continue to emphasize safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial diligence at all sites.
If you turn your attention to our to-do list on Slide 3. On March 3, we closed the acquisition of the Union Power Station. This acquisition is both an important driver in achieving our 2016 earnings expectation, and also one more important step in our broader plan to modernize our fleet and provide lower cost reliable generation for our customers. Recovery of the cost of this investment in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans effectively began simultaneously with the transactions close, thanks to a collaborative agreement between our team, our regulators and other participants, who recognized the benefits of this investment for our customers.
Another important component of our supply plan is building the St. Charles power station. Hearing at the LPSC began April 18 and is expected to conclude today. Thus we expect that the LPSC will be able to take up the certification decision in August. This is an important investment to serve our customers in Louisiana, and is an example of the infrastructure development that we're undertaking to position the utility for the future.
Beyond generation, we also continue to make significant progress on providing benefits to our customers through our transmission investments. We officially kicked off Entergy Louisiana's Lake Charles transmission project with a wire cutting ceremony in March. Once completed, this $150 million -- $159 million project will support continued reliability and service to a rapidly growing area in our service territory. On the regulatory front, we've also made progress towards better aligning the timing of our investments with the needs of our customers going forward. This will improve access to the capital needed to make the investments required to enhance the reliability and capability of our system and provide lower costs, more environmentally-friendly resources of generation for the benefit of our customers.
This ultimately supports economic development on our service territory, which strengthens communities, creates jobs and brings more financial stability to the regions we support. This quarter, we filed or concluded several major proceedings. First, we received the final order on our Arkansas rate case and rate adjustments became effective on February 24. We will make our first formula rate plan filing in July, under the new framework, using a future test year, which will bring more predictability and strength to Entergy Arkansas' financial profile. This new regulatory structure is the result of collaboration among a broad group of stakeholders and will help us be a stronger partner to attract jobs and economic expansion to Arkansas. Last month, Moody's acknowledged of this view with an upgrade to Entergy Arkansas' long-term rating. Entergy Mississippi has also began to utilize its new formula rate plan with forward-looking features, and made its first filing on March 15. The filing reflects an anticipated earned ROE for the 2016 test year that is below the FRP bandwidth, indicating a $32.6 million rate increase to a point within the FRP bandwidth that reflects a 9.96% earned ROE.
A final order on that filing is expected before the end of the second quarter with the resulting rate adjustments to become effective around midyear.
And in February, the administrative law judge issued a proposal for a decision with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, on our transmission cost recovery filing. Based on the proposal for decision, we estimate $10 million to $11 million annual recovery on transmission spend, incremental to base rates. The use of this rider, along with the distribution cost rider we've been utilizing since January of 2016, will bring us greater financial flexibility to support the needs of our customers in Texas.
Louisiana commission also recently opened 2 generic dockets on the income tax and corporate structure questions. The dockets were initiated in response to specific commissioner concerns regarding the [indiscernible] transaction and the implications of that transaction's structure on taxes and rate making. While the dockets were generic and affect all LPSC jurisdictional utilities, we believe that the scope of the documents will be narrowly focused on those types of structures that gave rise to the dockets, and not on broader policy issues like tax normalization or tax-related matters previously approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Furthermore, we've worked constructively and transparently with the LPSC on tax-related matters. The LPSC is familiar with our tax positions, which have resulted in significant benefits to our customers.
The commission has 2 items regarding the [indiscernible] transaction on its Business and Executive Session agenda on April 28, and we're hopeful they'll take that opportunity to clarify the scope of these dockets. We do not expect significant effects for ELL as a result of these dockets.
Finally, we carefully monitored the effects of investments and rate actions on our customer's builds, which today remain, on an average, 20% to 25% below the national average. In fact, our average residential rates remain below $0.10 per kilowatt hour.
Looking forward, we continue to explore solutions that will meet our customers changing expectations in the evolving landscape of the utility industry. By introducing new technologies and renewable energy resources, we can build a grid that is cleaner, more resilient and affordable, and provides innovative opportunities in the way we interact to generate power for the benefit of all of our customers.
We're active on the renewables front with solar pilot power programs underway in Mississippi, New Orleans and Arkansas. Entergy Mississippi has completed 3 solar installations in 3 different locations, each capable of generating 500 kilowatts. Entergy New Orleans has begun construction of their 1 megawatt solar generation project with state-of-the-art battery storage technology. And Entergy Arkansas has entered into a power purchase agreement to facilitate construction of an 81-megawatt solar generating facility, which could be online as early as 2018.
These are the first steps towards assessing feasibility of utility scale solar generation, a resource that provides one way to help meet our voluntary commitment to stabilize our carbon dioxide emissions and reduce our environmental footprint.
At the same time, in 2015, our existing generating fleet continue to produce electricity at one of the lowest carbon dioxide emission rates in United States. We are building on these pilot programs and we've initiated 3 new requests for proposals for renewable side generation resources to help meet long-term resource planning objectives in our service territory. These RFPs are seeking up to 200 megawatts of capacity for Louisiana, 100 megawatts for Arkansas and 20 megawatts for New Orleans. The on-pilot programs, we've also created a commercial development and innovation team dedicated to evaluating and integrating other new technologies in our operating model. That team focuses on addressing customer needs and expectations through product and service innovation, technology deployment and alternative service models and will also research and develop the enabling technologies that enhance the distribution grid and provide higher service and reliability for all of our customers.
For example, as I mentioned last quarter, we are moving forward with the process to install advanced meters in our distribution system. At our Analyst Day in June, we will give you more details around the next steps for deployment of advanced meters and, similar to our approach for our supply plan back in 2014, we'll provide the initial strokes around broader plans for other potential grid modernization efforts, to be followed with more details over time.
I would take a moment now to talk about initiatives to improve our nuclear operations.
First of all, our plants are safe. If they weren't, they would not be running. But this past year, the performance of nuclear fleet as a whole was not in line with our standards. Operational excellence is integral to our business model and a core competency we must maintain to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. We've made it a top priority in 2016 to strengthen the culture of operational excellence throughout our organization. I would like to extend my thanks to Tim Mitchell, who started this down this path, who is our interim Chief Nuclear Officer; and welcome Chris Bakken, who has officially joined us as the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Reporting directly to me, Chris will now lead these efforts in the nuclear organization. In January, as part of a comprehensive fleet-wide performance improvement plan, we formed a corporate event response team with industry assistance around best practices and increased engagement with all stakeholders. We are evaluating nuclear operations across our fleet, from top to bottom, and we continue to evaluate the need for process changes at each individual plant. And it's not just about column four, our main long-term objective is sustained operational excellence across our fleet.
This could result in incremental nuclear spending, and we're working hard to mitigate any financial implications. At ANO, the NRC completed its supplemental inspection and announced those results at a public meeting earlier this month. The NRC is confident that the problems have been identified and a comprehensive plan is being implemented to correct them. The NRC is expected to issue a confirmatory action letter in the next several weeks, and we plan to give you an update at Analyst Day.
Finally, it's important to emphasize that the NRC did recognize that the plant is safe to continue power operations, and that the actions taken today, have further improved the margin of safety, not only at ANO, but at all of our other nuclear facilities. Pilgrim is also working toward process improvements and the NRC will complete a supplementary inspection of that plant, that'll focus on the corrective action program we've discussed, that resulted in entry into column 4 and a safety culture assessment. We'll inform the NRC when we're ready for that inspection, which we expect to be in the second half of this year.
Also, after careful consideration of the circumstances surrounding the plant's operations, we intend to refuel the plant in the spring of 2017, and run the plant safely to its current capacity market commitments with the ISO of New England, until the plant shut down date of May 31st, 2019.
And in the end point, we are committed to resolving performance deficiencies and ensuring recovery in plant performance. We performed and completed comprehensive inspections during our planned refueling outage at unit 2. We detected additional work involving [indiscernible] bolts which we'll fully address -- we will fully address before restarting the plant. Subject to the completion of engineering analysis, we expect to be done with the additional work and have the plant back online around late June. Finally, we remain focused on safely operating the Fitzpatrick Plant through January 27, 2017, followed by a safe shutdown and eventual decommissioning of the facility. The decisions to shut down assets are very difficult. And we're proud of our employees who remain focused on safe operations and finishing strong.
I reiterate our commitment to support them and the communities affected by the difficult decisions we've made for these plants. Speaking of the communities we serve, we recognize that we play an important role as a corporate citizen in every region where we operate, and our core values resonate in the ways we support our communities. Improving educational and the economic opportunities for customers in our communities is one way we demonstrate our commitment. As part of a 5-year $5 million initiative to support workforce development training, we've made a $250,000 grant to Jobs for America's Graduates. This program equips at-risk youth with the skills needed to transition successfully to careers or college, addressing critical workforce needs, closing skill gaps and creating a competitive advantage for local communities.
The benefits of program like this one are long-lasting in providing opportunities for those who might not otherwise have some, and helping to raise the standard of living for a family for generations to come. We've also made a two-year $450,000 grant to Red Cross to support disaster response in our communities. Recent floods damaged really 13,000 homes in Louisiana, and damage is still being assessed from this month's floods in Texas, highlighting the importance of a fast response in times of disaster.
Through our partnership with the Red Cross, Entergy is able to direct funds to communities following storms or other disasters, as they are needed, allowing help to be provided more quickly to those in need. I'm also proud of our initiatives, which help us maintain a diverse and engaged workforce. Veterans and active reserves make valuable contributions to our company, and in recognition of our efforts to support National Guard and reserve members, we've been selected as a finalist for the 2016 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. We're pleased to be considered for this honor, and we appreciate the sacrifice that these employees and their families make and their service to our country, as well as the unique skills and experiences that they bring to Entergy. These are just some of the efforts that got us ranked top quartile in Corporate Responsibility magazine's annual list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens. This is the 7th time we've been included on this list, which recognizes companies taking sustainable, responsible actions in areas such as employee relations, philanthropy and community support, environment and climate change.
Nowhere are these qualities are more important -- apparent than where our employees go above and beyond to serve our customers during their most difficult times. Many of you may have seen or read about the significant flooding in our service territory this quarter. Though our system withstood the conditions quite well, our employees were also very diligent in safely restoring powers to those that needed it, repairing damaged infrastructure and even saving lives.
I'm excited about all that we've done so far in 2016 to execute on our strategy. This quarter was a good start to the year. The major undertakings we've completed will help drive our 2016 results. We're also aware of the challenges ahead, and more work needs to be done to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Everything we do is designed to support our objective to create value for each of our four stakeholders. We strive to deliver top quartile returns for our owners, provide top quartile satisfaction for our customers, achieve top quartile organization health scores and top decile safety performance for our employees, and maintain an active role in supporting our communities by achieving top decile performance for corporate social responsibility.
With these objectives in mind, we remain focused on the strategy we've developed to achieve those objectives. Steadily grow the utility by investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates, with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make those investments, and continue to reduce the EWC footprint while ensuring safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial due diligence for our assets.
We are off to a good start and will continue to execute through the remainder of the year on the plans that we've laid out. With that, I will turn the call over to Drew."
269764,329723343,963312,"Entergy Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the results for the quarter.

As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the results for the quarter. Turning to Slide 4, our operational earnings excluding special items were $1.35 per share, higher than we expected. This compares to a $1.68 a year ago. This quarter's results varied from last year due to the effects of weather and a 2015 income tax item and Utility, Parent and Other, and lower wholesale power prices at EWC. These declines were partially offset by growth in the utility business.
In both periods, as reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close. These special items are for severance and retention costs as well as capital spending, which is being expensed. 
Turning to Utility, Parent and Other results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share decreased $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. However, the adjusted view on Slide 6, which excludes the effects of weather and income tax items, increased $0.19.
The growth in our base business is a result of our efforts in the last year to execute on our strategy to make productive investment that benefit customers and improve returns in our operating companies. Consistent with that strategy, Entergy Arkansas rate case is an important driver for the quarterly results. Rate adjustments were effective starting February 24, and included recovery for the Union Power Station acquisition. In addition, the final order allowed the deferral of $0.06 of previously expensed Fukushima and flood barrier compliance costs, which we collected over 10 years.
Combined, these items contributed about $0.15 to this quarter's earnings. 
A second driver of note, was improved efforts to manage nonfuel O&M expense, which decreased $0.07 after excluding the deferral I just noted. The scope for [indiscernible] spending and benefit costs, including pension, were lower, while nuclear spending increased. This quarter, we also recorded a charge of approximately $0.05 associated with FERC quarters in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding, which came out last Thursday.
The charge represents the portion of EAI's estimated liability that would be attributable to its wholesale business and is not recoverable. This is a complex and technical case that continues on at the FERC, and the ultimate outcome is uncertain. We will provide additional details in our Form 10-Q.
Turning to sales. We also saw earnings contribution from over 6% industrial sales growth. Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the increase. About 70% of this quarter's increase came from new and expansion customers across several sectors as they continue to ramp and come online. Higher sales to existing customers were driven by petroleum refiners as fewer and shorter outages drove industrial sales growth in the quarter. This is expected to continue into 2Q.
Growth in new and expansion customers are also expected to continue through the rest of the year. However, given how strong refiners ran in the second half of last year and expected outages and changes in operational levels later this year, we expect industrial growth to be weighted towards the first half of 2016.
Turning to EWC's first quarter results summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.51 in the current quarter, $0.20 lower than the prior year. The single most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet average price was down more than $8 per megawatt hour or nearly 13%. In addition, realized earnings on decommissioning trust declined due to last year's rebalancing activity for BY's trust, which resulted in higher interest income in 2015. On the other hand, the effect of last year's impairments reduced fuel -- nuclear refueling outage and depreciation expenses, which benefited earnings approximately $0.16 this quarter.
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow for this quarter of $533 million, about $80 million lower than the same quarter in 2015. The largest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 10. As of today, we see adjusted Utility, Parent and Other earnings at our guidance midpoint. Recall, this excludes the effects of any weather or tax items. For our consolidated guidance, we must also consider negative weather to-date, EWC price declines since year-end and the extended outage at Indian Point unit 2. For IP 2, we've not yet completed our engineering analysis, but based on information to-date, our preliminary estimate is that the extended hours will reduce earnings by approximately $0.20. This is primarily from lost revenue, but also includes higher refueling outage costs, which we currently estimate to be around $20 million.
The higher outage cost will be amortized over the life of the outage, with the bulk of the earnings effect in 2017.
Looking at the balance of the year, there are additional risks and opportunities that could apply to both Utility, Parent and Other, as well as Entergy overall. As Leo mentioned, we have the potential for higher nuclear spending as we execute on our nuclear performance improvement plan. As always, there are potential risk to our sales forecasts. We also see opportunities to mitigate these challenges or provide upside, starting with management of our spending, some of which began in the first quarter.
In addition, as we mentioned in our last quarterly call, there's potential for income tax items, possibly as early as the second quarter of this year. Considering all these factors, we're affirming our guidance for the year. 
Moving to a longer-term view, Slide 11 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook, which is unchanged. Some of the challenges and opportunities that we've noted for '16, exist on an ongoing basis, and added uncertainty for -- with some added uncertainty for pension expenses, but also with the added benefit of efficient regulatory mechanisms. Our strategy to realize these results remains the same as we focus on making productive investments to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with timely and predictable investment recovery.
Slide 12 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook, assuming market prices as of March 31. One thing to note, is the root cause analysis is being [indiscernible] to both issues could prompt an accelerated inspection schedule for unit 3 in Indian Point. This is not reflected in our current estimates, and we plan to provide more information once our analysis is complete.
Before closing, I would like to give you a little more detail on our Analyst Day on June 9, in New York City, in Midtown. We'll talk about what's next for Entergy, and the utility growth opportunities before us. We will also provide some longer-term 5-year views and more detail on our nuclear performance improvement plan.
Our extended management team, including our new Chief Nuclear Officer, Chris Bakken, will be there to give you an opportunity to talk with them about their areas of responsibility. We look forward to seeing you there. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

So in EWC, there was some mark-to-market and elements that came in about $0.04 of that, and then about $0.03 a volume, as we actually ran better in the quarter before the outages -- the planned outages took over. So we actually were about $0.07, $0.08 ahead at EWC versus our previous expectation. The balance of that was that utility, some of it, was the -- or the bulk of the O&M savings that we saw above expectation were in the fossil area as we came through the outage season, we actually did much better than we have historically. And then in the balance of it, as you referenced, there was some conservatism built into the Arkansas rate case. So we -- that was justified at the -- right at the very end, we did lose $5 million of comp, but that spread out differently than we've built the conservatism into our case.

I think when we think about those two particular classes, we continue to see impacts from energy efficiency. As we've talked about on previous calls, both at kind of federal-type programs as well as some of our local energy efficiency programs that we see within our jurisdictions. In terms of what we expected, I mean, given some of the economic data that we were utilizing to try and forecast sales, we did see some economic weakening in the first quarter and we somewhat expected that. So while I do agree it was fairly low for the first quarter, it was a little bit below our expectations, but it wasn't necessarily a big surprise to us. And as we go forward throughout the year, we expect to see that, the comeback, as we look at growth state products in the regions that we serve, particularly Louisiana and Texas, we see that starting to kind of sell out and begin to trend upward, and we think that will help move those growth rates back to where -- to the more typical level. But again, energy efficiency will continue to have an impact on our residential and commercial sectors."

Anything we do would need to be consistent with the internal plan that we have right now. And as you know, we have lot of organic growth that is happening because of the modernization of our infrastructure in both transmission and generation. And then some of the things that we've talked about as it relates to new technologies that we tend to deploy, whether it's the solar RFPs, et cetera, that I talked about, or the advanced metering or what's to come next. So we've got a significant organic growth opportunity in working through the investment plan, the financing plan and the regulatory structure around that to make it beneficial to our customers, first and foremost on our mind. So anything we do would have to be consistent with that objective -- with that strategy. So that's the first screen we go through, is, what would help us in that, whether its cash flow, balance sheet, other growth opportunities, technology synergies, et cetera. Secondly, we would want it to be transactable, something that we know we can have a really good chance of getting done, both through counterparty engagement. Price that make sense to us, on whatever side of the table we would sit on, and regulatory execution. And three, it cannot distract us from doing number 1. We don't want to have a couple of years of not doing the growth -- organic growth that we have today, while we try to do something that's supposed to help us get that done. So those 3 criteria continue. And to be -- the way we look at it, as you know, we evaluate this kind of thing on a regular ongoing basis. If anything comes up, we'll obviously let you know.

And we've done that at [indiscernible], Vermont Yankee and [indiscernible], then its Fitzpatrick to follow. The plans that aren't supported by the market or that are no longer fit the portfolio. As far as the operating plan, I think around -- just a lump, I think, Indian Point and Palisades in together, you'll certainly -- currently today they are not in the same situation necessarily as the other plants, as far as being cash flow positive. If they're not operating versus cash flow positive, if they are. You'll remember when we made those decisions around those facilities, we looked at 3 different things. One, what's the NPV of the facility, is it negative or positive? Two, what's the near-term cash flow burn rate, positive or negative? And three, how does the change of risk profile of the company. I think we achieved our objectives with all of those, including the right sale around that. And we continue to evaluate the other plants in this similar manner. The difference being, obviously, the PPA supports the cost structure at Palisades and the market supports the cost structure at Indian Point. As far as any kind of opportunities that we would have around those facilities, outside of the decisions we've already made, I can't really comment and wouldn't comment on that. Just because once we've started down that path, our strategy or our policy is to just not comment on those sorts of things. But like I said, we are looking at those in the same way, from an NPV, cash flow and risk standpoint, what are our options with those facilities. And we will pick the one that we believe creates the best value for our stakeholders. And again, is the NPV positive to run versus what our alternative will become? That will be a major driver. If it's Cash flow positive or negative, in particularly in the near term, or one of those alternatives to run the plant. And third, is the -- does it change the risk profile? And obviously, our view is that making that footprint; smaller does improve the risk profile of the company. And then, the Last thing we always need to look at is the execution opportunity. Is it something similar to what I discussed on the question around M&A? There's a lot of things that we could do, but we have to make sure anything we do is executable both with the counterparty, our own point of view, and through the regulatory process."

But at this point, we think we can manage those costs within the framework of the expectations that we have for guidance and the outlooks right now."

If -- your economics could've been different, and we've -- for example, we've been promoting a clean energy standard in New York, that would include nuclear plants for several years. And the reason, obviously, that we'd do that is, one, it's the right thing to do from a public policy standpoint. And it's certainly the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint, from an energy price standpoint to support the market's reliability, the whole 9 yards. And we've been promoting it for a number of years, because obviously, these things must take their course in the regulatory arena and then in the legislation -- legislative it's regulatory or the courts. And obviously, you can always expect there to be intervention into anything that comes up, and these things just take a long time to develop. And so, right now, there is no -- nothing in place. We don't know if there was something in place, what it would be. We don't know, if knew how it was structured, what it would provide. We don't know if, what it provided would be enough to support the economics of the plant. And we don't know that the timing of it could ever been done before we had to make the decision to go ahead and refuel, which then would come in to several hundred million dollars of losses. So we're out of time. It's not that we're against any of those proposals in terms of -- on their face, other than I would say that, that obviously, we believe that if there's a clean energy standard in New York that includes nuclear -- it should include all of the nuclear plants. And we commend them for their efforts, because we think that's the right thing to do, or we wouldn't have been proposing it for the last couple of years. I mean, you hit the nail on the head on this point of no return aspect. It's not in place. We don't know what it is. We don't know what it'll provide. We don't know what the economics would be, and for it to run its course, again, we're unfortunately, we likely out of time. So anything that says we're opposed to a clean energy standard and the like, we're not. We've been fulfilling those all along. Again, we do think this should incorporate all plants in the state. We would be for it all plants in the country, actually, to be consistent. But right now, there is nothing in place that we could look at, that would provide us the opportunity to change our decision."

This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy. We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station;",2794,"Thank you, David., and good morning, everyone. This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy. We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station; finalized our Arkansas rate case; received a final order in our distribution cost recovery factor filing in Texas; filed our first FRP with forward-looking features in Mississippi; completed the ANO NRC inspection; received confirmation from the New York ISO that the shutdown of Fitzpatrick will not affect reliability in the region; saw over 6% industrial sales growth versus last year; and today, we are reporting first quarter operational earnings per share of $1.35, above what we expected.
While that's a good start, we're also aware that it's early in the year and we'd face challenges ahead. But we're confident that we can manage these and deliver on our earnings commitments for the year as well as our adjusted Utility, Parent And Other long-term outlook. Our results for this quarter are the outcome of the strategy we have been pursuing for some time to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders in 2016 and beyond. At the utility, investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, which provides the financial flexibility we need to make these investments, and at EWC, continuing to reduce our footprint to limit exposure from assets not supported by the market. We've already materially reduced our size, risk and volatility through the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center and the shutdown of Vermont Yankee. This trend will only accelerate as Pilgrim and Fitzpatrick come offline. We will continue to emphasize safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial diligence at all sites.
If you turn your attention to our to-do list on Slide 3. On March 3, we closed the acquisition of the Union Power Station. This acquisition is both an important driver in achieving our 2016 earnings expectation, and also one more important step in our broader plan to modernize our fleet and provide lower cost reliable generation for our customers. Recovery of the cost of this investment in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans effectively began simultaneously with the transactions close, thanks to a collaborative agreement between our team, our regulators and other participants, who recognized the benefits of this investment for our customers.
Another important component of our supply plan is building the St. Charles power station. A hearing at the LPSC began April 18 and is expected to conclude today. Thus, we expect that the LPSC will be able to take up the certification decision in August. This is an important investment to serve our customers in Louisiana, and is an example of the infrastructure development that we're undertaking to position the utility for the future.
Beyond generation, we also continue to make significant progress on providing benefits to our customers through our transmission investments. We officially kicked off Entergy Louisiana's Lake Charles transmission project with a wire cutting ceremony in March. Once completed, this $150 million -- $159 million project will support continued reliability and service to a rapidly growing area in our service territory. On the regulatory front, we've also made progress towards better aligning the timing of our investments with the needs of our customers going forward. This will improve access to the capital needed to make the investments required to enhance the reliability and capability of our system and provide lower costs, more environmentally-friendly resources of generation for the benefit of our customers.
This ultimately supports economic development on our service territory, which strengthens communities, creates jobs and brings more financial stability to the regions we support. This quarter, we filed or concluded several major proceedings. First, we received the final order on our Arkansas rate case and rate adjustments became effective on February 24. We will make our first formula rate plan filing in July, under the new framework, using a future test year, which will bring more predictability and strength to Entergy Arkansas' financial profile. This new regulatory structure is the result of collaboration among a broad group of stakeholders and will help us be a stronger partner to attract jobs and economic expansion to Arkansas. Last month, Moody's acknowledged this view with an upgrade to Entergy Arkansas' long-term rating. Entergy Mississippi has also began to utilize its new formula rate plan with forward-looking features, and made its first filing on March 15. The filing reflects an anticipated earned ROE for the 2016 test year that is below the FRP bandwidth, indicating a $32.6 million rate increase to a point within the FRP bandwidth that reflects a 9.96% earned ROE.
A final order on that filing is expected before the end of the second quarter with the resulting rate adjustments to become effective around midyear.
And in February, the administrative law judge issued a proposal for a decision with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, on our transmission cost recovery filing. Based on the proposal for decision, we estimate $10 million to $11 million annual recovery on transmission spend, incremental to base rates. The use of this rider, along with the distribution cost rider we've been utilizing since January of 2016, will bring us greater financial flexibility to support the needs of our customers in Texas.
The Louisiana commission also recently opened 2 generic dockets on the income tax and corporate structure questions. The dockets were initiated in response to specific commissioner concerns regarding the Cleco transaction and the implications of that transaction's structure on taxes and rate making. While the dockets are generic and affect all LPSC jurisdictional utilities, we believe that the scope of the documents will be narrowly focused on those types of structures that gave rise to the dockets, and not on broader policy issues like tax normalization or tax-related matters previously approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Furthermore, we've worked constructively and transparently with the LPSC on tax-related matters. The LPSC is familiar with our tax positions, which have resulted in significant benefits to our customers.
The commission has 2 items regarding the Cleco transaction on its Business and Executive Session agenda on April 28, and we're hopeful they'll take that opportunity to clarify the scope of these dockets. We do not expect significant effects for ELL as a result of these dockets.
Finally, we carefully monitored the effects of investments and rate actions on our customer's builds, which today remain, on an average, 20% to 25% below the national average. In fact, our average residential rates remain below $0.10 per kilowatt hour.
Looking forward, we continue to explore solutions that will meet our customers' changing expectations in the evolving landscape of the utility industry. By introducing new technologies and renewable energy resources, we can build a grid that is cleaner, more resilient and affordable, and provides innovative opportunities in the way we interact and generate power for the benefit of all of our customers.
We're active on the renewables front with solar pilot power programs underway in Mississippi, New Orleans and Arkansas. Entergy Mississippi has completed 3 solar installations in 3 different locations, each capable of generating 500 kilowatts. Entergy New Orleans has begun construction of their 1 megawatt solar generation project with state-of-the-art battery storage technology. And Entergy Arkansas has entered into a power purchase agreement to facilitate construction of an 81-megawatt solar generating facility, which could be online as early as 2018.
These are the first steps towards assessing feasibility of utility scale solar generation, a resource that provides one way to help meet our voluntary commitment to stabilize our carbon dioxide emissions and reduce our environmental footprint.
At the same time, in 2015, our existing generating fleet continued to produce electricity at one of the lowest carbon dioxide emission rates in the United States. We are building on these pilot programs and we've initiated 3 new requests for proposals for renewable side generation resources to help meet long-term resource planning objectives in our service territory. These RFPs are seeking up to 200 megawatts of capacity for Louisiana, 100 megawatts for Arkansas and 20 megawatts for New Orleans. The on-pilot programs, we've also created a commercial development and innovation team dedicated to evaluating and integrating other new technologies in our operating model. That team focuses on addressing customer needs and expectations through product and service innovation, technology deployment and alternative service models and will also research and develop the enabling technologies that enhance the distribution grid and provide higher service and reliability for all of our customers.
For example, as I mentioned last quarter, we are moving forward with the process to install advanced meters in our distribution system. At our Analyst Day in June, we will give you more details around the next steps for deployment of advanced meters and, similar to our approach for our supply plan back in 2014, we'll provide the initial strokes around broader plans for other potential grid modernization efforts, to be followed with more details over time.
I would take a moment now to talk about initiatives to improve our nuclear operations.
First of all, our plants are safe. If they weren't, they would not be running. But this past year, the performance of nuclear fleet as a whole was not in line with our standards. Operational excellence is integral to our business model and a core competency we must maintain to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. We've made it a top priority in 2016 to strengthen the culture of operational excellence throughout our organization. I would like to extend my thanks to Tim Mitchell, who started this down this path, who is our interim Chief Nuclear Officer; and welcome Chris Bakken, who has officially joined us as the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Reporting directly to me, Chris will now lead these efforts in the nuclear organization. In January, as part of a comprehensive fleet-wide performance improvement plan, we formed a corporate event response team with industry assistance around best practices and increased engagement with all stakeholders. We are evaluating nuclear operations across our fleet, from top to bottom, and we continue to evaluate the need for process changes at each individual plant. And it's not just about column four, our main long-term objective is sustained operational excellence across our fleet.
This could result in incremental nuclear spending, and we're working hard to mitigate any financial implications. At ANO, the NRC completed its supplemental inspection and announced those results at a public meeting earlier this month. The NRC is confident that the problems have been identified and a comprehensive plan is being implemented to correct them. The NRC is expected to issue a confirmatory action letter in the next several weeks, and we plan to give you an update at Analyst Day.
Finally, it's important to emphasize that the NRC did recognize that the plant is safe to continue power operations, and that the actions taken today, have further improved the margin of safety, not only at ANO, but at all of our other nuclear facilities. Pilgrim is also working toward process improvements and the NRC will complete a supplementary inspection of that plant, with a focus on the corrective action program we've discussed, that resulted in entry into column 4 and a safety culture assessment. We'll inform the NRC when we're ready for that inspection, which we expect to be in the second half of this year.
Also, after careful consideration of the circumstances surrounding the plant's operations, we intend to refuel the plant in the spring of 2017, and run the plant safely through its current capacity market commitments with the ISO of New England, until the planned shut down date of May 31st, 2019.
And in the end point, we are committed to resolving performance deficiencies and ensuring recovery in plant performance. We performed and completed comprehensive inspections during our planned refueling outage at unit 2. We detected additional work involving [indiscernible] bolts which we'll fully address -- we will fully address before restarting the plant. Subject to the completion of engineering analysis, we expect to be done with the additional work and have the plant back online around late June. Finally, we remain focused on safely operating the Fitzpatrick Plant through January 27, 2017, followed by a safe shutdown and eventual decommissioning of the facility. The decisions to shut down assets are very difficult. And we're proud of our employees who remain focused on safe operations and finishing strong.
I reiterate our commitment to support them and the communities affected by the difficult decisions we've made for these plants. Speaking of the communities we serve, we recognize that we play an important role as a corporate citizen in every region where we operate, and our core values resonate in the ways we support our communities. Improving educational and the economic opportunities for customers in our communities is one way we demonstrate our commitment. As part of a 5-year $5 million initiative to support workforce development training, we've made a $250,000 grant to Jobs for America's Graduates. This program equips at-risk youth with the skills needed to transition successfully to careers or college, addressing critical workforce needs, closing skill gaps and creating a competitive advantage for local communities.
The benefits of program like this one are long-lasting in providing opportunities for those who might not otherwise have some, and helping to raise the standard of living for a family for generations to come. We've also made a two-year $450,000 grant to the Red Cross to support disaster response in our communities. Recent floods damaged really 13,000 homes in Louisiana, and damage is still being assessed from this month's floods in Texas, highlighting the importance of a fast response in times of disaster.
Through our partnership with the Red Cross, Entergy is able to direct funds to communities following storms or other disasters, as they are needed, allowing help to be provided more quickly to those in need. I'm also proud of our initiatives, which help us maintain a diverse and engaged workforce. Veterans and active Reservists make valuable contributions to our company, and in recognition of our efforts to support National Guard and Reserve members, we've been selected as a finalist for the 2016 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. We're pleased to be considered for this honor, and we appreciate the sacrifice that these employees and their families make in their service to our country, as well as the unique skills and experiences that they bring to Entergy. These are just some of the efforts that got us ranked top quartile in Corporate Responsibility magazine's annual list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens. This is the 7th time we've been included on this list, which recognizes companies taking sustainable, responsible actions in areas such as employee relations, philanthropy and community support, environment and climate change.
Nowhere are these qualities are more important -- apparent than when our employees go above and beyond to serve our customers during their most difficult times. Many of you may have seen or read about the significant flooding in our service territory this quarter. Though our system withstood the conditions quite well, our employees were also very diligent in safely restoring power to those that needed it, repairing damaged infrastructure and even saving lives.
I'm excited about all that we've done so far in 2016 to execute on our strategy. This quarter was a good start to the year. The major undertakings we've completed will help drive our 2016 results. We're also aware of the challenges ahead, and more work needs to be done to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Everything we do is designed to support our objective to create value for each of our four stakeholders. We strive to deliver top quartile returns for our owners, provide top quartile satisfaction for our customers, achieve top quartile organization health scores and top decile safety performance for our employees, and maintain an active role in supporting our communities by achieving top decile performance for corporate social responsibility.
With these objectives in mind, we remain focused on the strategy we've developed to achieve those objectives. Steadily grow the utility by investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates, with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make those investments, and continue to reduce the EWC footprint while ensuring safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial due diligence for our assets.
We are off to a good start and will continue to execute through the remainder of the year on the plans that we've laid out. With that, I will turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the results for the quarter. Turning to Slide 4, our operational earnings excluding special items were $1.35 per share, higher than we expected. This compares to $1.68 a year ago. This quarter's results varied from last year due to the effects of weather and a 2015 income tax item and Utility, Parent and Other, and lower wholesale power prices at EWC. These declines were partially offset by growth in the utility business.
In both periods, as reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close. These special items are for severance and retention costs as well as capital spending, which is being expensed. 
Turning to Utility, Parent and Other results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share decreased $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. However, the adjusted view on Slide 6, which excludes the effects of weather and income tax items, increased $0.19.
The growth in our base business is a result of our efforts in the last year to execute on our strategy to make productive investment that benefit customers and improve returns in our operating companies. Consistent with that strategy, Entergy Arkansas rate case is an important driver for the quarterly results. Rate adjustments were effective starting February 24, and included recovery for the Union Power Station acquisition. In addition, the final order allowed the deferral of $0.06 of previously expensed Fukushima and flood barrier compliance costs, which we collected over 10 years.
Combined, these items contributed about $0.15 to this quarter's earnings. 
A second driver of note, was improved efforts to manage nonfuel O&M expense, which decreased $0.07 after excluding the deferral I just noted. The scope for [indiscernible] spending and benefit costs, including pension, were lower, while nuclear spending increased. This quarter, we also recorded a charge of approximately $0.05 associated with FERC quarters in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding, which came out last Thursday.
The charge represents the portion of EAI's estimated liability that would be attributable to its wholesale business and is not recoverable. This is a complex and technical case that continues on at the FERC, and the ultimate outcome is uncertain. We will provide additional details in our Form 10-Q.
Turning to sales. We also saw earnings contribution from over 6% industrial sales growth. Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the increase. About 70% of this quarter's increase came from new and expansion customers across several sectors as they continue to ramp and come online. Higher sales to existing customers were driven by petroleum refiners as fewer and shorter outages drove industrial sales growth in the quarter. This is expected to continue into 2Q.
Growth in new and expansion customers are also expected to continue through the rest of the year. However, given how strong refiners ran in the second half of last year and expected outages and changes in operational levels later this year, we expect industrial growth to be weighted towards the first half of 2016.
Turning to EWC's first quarter results summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.51 in the current quarter, $0.20 lower than the prior year. The single most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet average price was down more than $8 per megawatt hour or nearly 13%. In addition, realized earnings on decommissioning trust declined due to last year's rebalancing activity for BY's trust, which resulted in higher interest income in 2015. On the other hand, the effect of last year's impairments reduced fuel -- nuclear refueling outage and depreciation expenses, which benefited earnings approximately $0.16 this quarter.
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow for this quarter of $533 million, about $80 million lower than the same quarter in 2015. The largest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 10. As of today, we see adjusted Utility, Parent and Other earnings at our guidance midpoint. Recall, this excludes the effects of any weather or tax items. For our consolidated guidance, we must also consider negative weather to-date, EWC price declines since year-end and the extended outage at Indian Point unit 2. For IP 2, we've not yet completed our engineering analysis, but based on information to-date, our preliminary estimate is that the extended outage will reduce earnings by approximately $0.20. This is primarily from lost revenue, but also includes higher refueling outage costs, which we currently estimate to be around $20 million.
The higher outage cost will be amortized over the life of the outage, with the bulk of the earnings effect in 2017.
Looking at the balance of the year, there are additional risks and opportunities that could apply to both Utility, Parent and Other, as well as Entergy overall. As Leo mentioned, we have the potential for higher nuclear spending as we execute on our nuclear performance improvement plan. As always, there are potential risks to our sales forecasts. We also see opportunities to mitigate these challenges or provide upside, starting with management of our spending, some of which began in the first quarter.
In addition, as we mentioned in our last quarterly call, there's potential for income tax items, possibly as early as the second quarter of this year. Considering all these factors, we're affirming our guidance for the year. 
Moving to a longer-term view, Slide 11 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook, which is unchanged. Some of the challenges and opportunities that we've noted for '16, exist on an ongoing basis, and added uncertainty for -- with some added uncertainty for pension expenses, but also with the added benefit of efficient regulatory mechanisms. Our strategy to realize these results remains the same as we focus on making productive investments to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with timely and predictable investment recovery.
Slide 12 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook, assuming market prices as of March 31. One thing to note, is the root cause analysis is being both issues could prompt an accelerated inspection schedule for unit 3 in Indian Point. This is not reflected in our current estimates, and we plan to provide more information once our analysis is complete.
Before closing, I would like to give you a little more detail on our Analyst Day on June 9, in New York City, in Midtown. We'll talk about what's next for Entergy, and the utility growth opportunities before us. We will also provide some longer-term 5-year views and more detail on our nuclear performance improvement plan.
Our extended management team, including our new Chief Nuclear Officer, Chris Bakken, will be there to give you an opportunity to talk with them about their areas of responsibility. We look forward to seeing you there. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

So we actually were about $0.07, $0.08 ahead at EWC versus our previous expectation. The balance of that was that utility, some of it, was the -- or the bulk of the O&M savings that we saw above expectation were in the fossil area as we came through the outage season, we actually did much better than we have historically. And then in the balance of it, as you referenced, there was some conservatism built into the Arkansas rate case. So we -- that was justified at the -- right at the very end, we did lose $5 million of comp, but that spread out differently than we've built the conservatism into our case. Some of those Fukushima and flood barrier costs were not part of our expectations for the quarter but they were able to stay in at that final order. And then, some timing elements were, for the period between February 24 and April 1, went in our favor, but they weren't in our overall expectation. So that's more of a timing shift between periods.

And we've done that at RISE, Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim, then its Fitzpatrick to follow. The plants that aren't supported by the market or that are and no longer fit the portfolio. As far as the operating plan, I think around -- just a lump, I think, Indian Point and Palisades in together, you'll certainly -- currently today they are not in the same situation necessarily as the other plants, as far as being cash flow positive. If they're not operating versus cash flow positive, if they are. You'll remember when we made those decisions around those facilities, we looked at 3 different things. One, what's the NPV of the facility, is it negative or positive? Two, what's the near-term cash flow burn rate, positive or negative? And three, how does the change of risk profile of the company. I think we achieved our objectives with all of those, including the RISE sale around that. And we continue to evaluate the other plants in a similar manner. The difference being, obviously, the PPA supports the cost structure at Palisades and the market supports the cost structure at Indian Point. As far as any kind of opportunities that we would have around those facilities, outside of the decisions we've already made, I can't really comment and wouldn't comment on that. Just because once we've started down that path, our strategy or our policy is to just not comment on those sorts of things. But like I said, we are looking at those in the same way, from an NPV, cash flow and risk standpoint, what are our options with those facilities. And we will pick the one that we believe creates the best value for our stakeholders. And again, is the NPV positive to run versus what our alternative will become? That will be a major driver. If it's Cash flow positive or negative, in particularly in the near term, for one of those alternatives to run the plant. And third, is the -- does it change the risk profile? And obviously, our view is that making that footprint; smaller does improve the risk profile of the company. And then, the last thing we always need to look at is the execution opportunity. Is it something similar to what I discussed on the question around M&A? There's a lot of things that we could do, but we have to make sure anything we do is executable both with the counterparty, our own point of view, and through the regulatory process."

If -- economics could've been different, and we've -- for example, we've been promoting a clean energy standard in New York, that would include nuclear plants for several years. And the reason, obviously, that we'd do that is, one, it's the right thing to do from a public policy standpoint. And it's certainly the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint, from an energy price standpoint to support the market's reliability, the whole 9 yards. And we've been promoting it for a number of years, because obviously, these things must take their course in the regulatory arena and then in the legislation -- legislative it's regulatory or the courts. And obviously, you can always expect there to be intervention into anything that comes up, and these things just take a long time to develop. And so, right now, there is no -- nothing in place. We don't know if there was something in place, what it would be. We don't know, if knew how it was structured, what it would provide. We don't know if, what it provided would be enough to support the economics of the plant. And we don't know that the timing of it could ever been done before we had to make the decision to go ahead and refuel, which then would come in to several hundred million dollars of losses. So we're out of time. It's not that we're against any of those proposals in terms of -- on their face, other than I would say that, that obviously, we believe that if there's a clean energy standard in New York that includes nuclear -- it should include all of the nuclear plants. And we commend them for their efforts, because we think that's the right thing to do, or we wouldn't have been proposing it for the last couple of years. I mean, you hit the nail on the head on this point of no return aspect. It's not in place. We don't know what it is. We don't know what it'll provide. We don't know what the economics would be, and for it to run its course, again, we're unfortunately, we're likely out of time. So anything that says we're opposed to a clean energy standard and the like, we're not. We've been for those all along. Again, we do think this should incorporate all plants in the state. We would be for all plants in the country, actually, to be consistent. But right now, there is nothing in place that we could look at, that would provide us the opportunity to change our decision."

Strong growth in our core business, absent any impact of taxes or weather, was coupled with significant accomplishment. We spent the first half of 2016 working to execute on our strategy and the results we are reporting today are a reflection of that work. 
We've made progress towards meeting our objective of steady predictable growth at the Utility, while reducing our EWC footprint. We delivered solid results through the first half of the year.
Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased 35% this quarter versus last year and are in line with our growth expectations for our core business. Most importantly, we continue to set up the business to achieve our longer term targets. Our extensive 2016 to-do list on Slide 3 is a road map of the execution of our strategy, and it's a good way to illustrate some of what we've accomplished. 
At the utility, we received a favorable ALJ recommendation for the St. Charles Power Station. The result of the Entergy Louisiana request for proposal was announced with the self-build alternative and one long-term power purchase agreement selected. The self-build alternative was also selected in the Entergy Texas request for proposal. 
Entergy New Orleans filed for approval for a new gas-fired combustion turbine. Entergy Mississippi received a revenue increased under its first formula rate plan filing with forward-looking features. Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year formula rate plan filing. Entergy Arkansas made its first full test year formula rate filing. Entergy Texas received approval on its transmission cost recovery factor writer. We received the confirmatory action letter from the NRC for ANO, and the letter is consistent with our expectation and we saw over 7% industrial growth versus last year. 
At EWC, we entered into negotiations for the sale of our FitzPatrick nuclear plant. Finally, we've met with many of you on our Analyst Day in June where we highlighted our progress towards effectively shifting our investment profile to a pure-play Utility.
We're achieving this shift by continuing to invest in the Utility for the benefit of our customers, while maintaining reasonable rates. One of these investments is the St. Charles Power Station project, which received a favorable recommendation from the Administrative Law Judge in July. We expect the certification decision from the LPSC in August. We're encouraged with the ALJ's recommendation that the project serves the public convenience for necessity is in the public's interest. The ALJ further recommends that Entergy Louisiana's decision to commence construction is prudent, and the selection of the project is consistent with the terms of the LPSC's market-based mechanisms order. 
We also continued to make progress for our plants for a CCGT in Texas. In April, the RFP process resulted in the selection of the self-build alternative, and in the third quarter, we we'll begin the necessary filing for regulatory approval. We are on a similar path in Louisiana with the RFP process also result in the selection of the self-build alternative, and we expect to make the necessary regulatory filings in the third quarter. That same RFP result in the selection of a long-term power purchase agreement for an existing CCGT resource, and we also plan to seek approval of the PPA from the LPSC.
Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the New Orleans City Council seeking approval to build the New Orleans powerstation the natural gas-fired combustion turbine plant at the existing issued site. This request follows the early June deactivations of our 1960's units 2 and 3. These units are a prime example of the aging infrastructure in our service territory. The decision to deactivate these units are based on economics, maintenance and operational considerations. A new plan will provide a long-term local resource that can meet the city's particular resource needs at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. 
We've requested strategic council approval by January 31, 2017. If approved as requested, the new plan is expected to be placed in service in the second half of 2019.
These investments will provide more cost-effective reliable and efficient generating resources for our customers. By building these plants, we will reduce the average age of our fleet and improve the heat rate in key areas of our system. For example, by 2025, in the low tab region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by approximately 19  years. Also in the South region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by 18 years. And with new units operating at few rates of less than 7,000, the efficiency of our fossil generation portfolio will be improved by roughly 800 B T years per TWH fleet-wide by 2025. 
Additionally, the new CCGT units well on average produced 41% fuel carbon dioxide emissions at our Legacy gas units.
In addition to addressing our aging infrastructure, we also need to control fuel volatility in our customer's builts. Our nuclear assets are critical to this subjective as they provide valuable fuel diversity to our utility fleet. The low volatility of nuclear fuel price effectively access the hedge against the high volatility of natural gas prices. Beyond fuel diversity, our nuclear assets also provide other significant benefits as large scale virtually emissions-free resources, these assets minimize our environmental footprint when the high-capacity factors and provide stable base generation. 
Nuclear generation also host of economic benefits and contributes to the financial health of the communities in which these assets sit, including thousands of good paying jobs, tax benefit to local state and federal governments and billions of dollars in economic output. 
Investing in the long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to preserve these benefits for our stakeholders is an important part of our utility strategy. We've drafted the framework for our nuclear sustainability plan that will preserve these benefits and that framework is now under external peer review. We're working on firming up the cost estimates and steps for implementation. We are currently on track with our commitment to providing you more specifics at EEAI this November.
We also have a path-forward at Arkansas Nuclear 1. The NRC issued its confirmatory action letter shortly after our Analyst Day and adopted our proposed comprehensive recovery plan. The letter confirmed that the plant we developed will lead us to sustained performance improvement. 
We will work diligently to complete the agreed upon actions listed in the letter to the satisfaction of the NRC. We believe we will be able to demonstrate to the NRC our ability to exit Column IV as early as late 2017. 
However, our goal is not to simply exit  Column IV, but to return to sustained operational excellence and to be considered one of the industry's strongest performers. 
We're rounding other generation portfolio with renewable and energy initiatives I talked about last quarter. Entergy  New Orleans, solar generation project with battery storage technology was placed in-service in June. Entergy Arkansa's power purchase agreement will support construction. We have an 81-megawatt solar energy generating facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018. 
Entergy Mississippi's 3 new solar installations are online and capable of generating 500 KWH. And we have 3  renewable requests for proposal outstanding at Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. In the Arkansas and New Orleans RFPs, bidders will have an opportunity to provide acquisition proposals. And in New Orleans proposal also includes a self-build option. 
Proposals are doing August for the Arkansas and Louisiana RFPs and in October, from New Orleans RFP. Final selections will be made in December of 2016, February of 2017 and April of 2017 for Louisiana, Arkansas and New Orleans, respectively.
In addition to our generation supply plan, we are executing on our transmission investment plan. In Arkansas, we placed in-service a new 23 mile, 230 kV line and completed a new 500 kV substation to serve Big River Steel. These 2 projects represent over $100 million of investment. 
In Mississippi, we completed the new distribution substation and kicked off 2 new projects for another new substation and 115 kV line additions of upgrades. These new products are expected to be in-service in 2017 in total, nearly $75 million of investment.
And in Texas, we placed 3 major projects in service between May and July, which totaled roughly $140 million in investment.
These are just a few examples of major transmission projects that facilitate improved sustained system liability, compliance with standards, enhanced economic development, while reducing transmission congestion. And all of these factors can ultimately contribute to a lower cost of service for our customers.
At the Analyst Day, we focused on investing in new technology to migrate towards a flexible, reliable and innovative integrated energy network. We're beginning the 1st phases of this process with advanced meters that change the way we manage our distribution system, reducing operating costs and providing savings for customers.
Since Analyst Day, we finalized our vendor and technology partners and have initiated the design phase of our project. Regulatory filings are expected to begin in September with the first filing to be made before the Louisiana Public Service Commissio. Filings and other jurisdictions will follow. 
Advanced metering is a foundational technology that supports other technologies to reduce costs and provide customers greater control and options over their energy usage. We've initiate a quick engineering study to assess the best path forward, incorporating these technologies and then integrated energy network for each of the operating companies. We will provide more information in due course.
These investments in technology and infrastructure delivered the same benefits as our more traditional investment in generation and transmission, namely a more efficient electric system with enhanced electric liability and reduced environmental footprint and reduced cost to serve our customers.
Over the past couple of years, we've improved our regulatory constructs to give us the ability to make investments that support economic development, create jobs, improve reliability in our systems and reduce our environmental impact. With many of those constricts now in place, we've moved into a rhythm of filing annual formula rate plans. 
Entergy Mississippi received an order approving the revenue increase for its first FRP filing with forward-looking features and rate adjustments were implemented at the end of June. Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year FRP filing at the end of May. And last month, Entergy Arkansas made its first FRP filing with a forward test year. 
And in Entergy Texas, we've been working on the implementation of the transmission cost recovery factor. We received approval on this rider in late June and recovery of transmission spend through this rider will relate back to April 14th.
I'll take a moment now to talk briefly about EWC starting with an update on program, which is currently preparing for its NRC inspection. Many of the same team members who put together the comprehensive recovery plan for ANO are working on plans for program. We expect to be ready for the NRC to conduct its inspection this fall with the confirmatory action letter potentially to be issued in the spring. 
And finally, in mid-July, we announced that we are in discussion with Exelon on the sale of our FitzPatrick nuclear plan. The opportunity to change the future FitzPatrick a significant positive impact on our employees and the surrounding communities, and we're willing to consider any viable options to keeping the plan to open. In that spirit, we applaud The New York PSC's decision to adopt the clean energy standard program. It is a critical component of a potential transaction. We are reviewing the order to confirm it addresses the issues we'd hope, but at this point, we are very encouraged.
As negotiations for sale continue, we continue to proceed along 2 parallel paths, preparing for the plants' permanent shutdown and decryption under the current plan while also preparing for a possible refueling and continued operation in the event of the sale. We are hopeful that negotiations can be completed this month.
Regardless of the outcome, our focus continues to be on the safe and reliable operation of the plant for as long as it continues to operate. We will also do our best to support our employees in the community throughout this transition, whether that leads to a sale to a new owner or the same shutdown and decommissioning of the plant.
I'd like to thank our hundreds of employees at FitzPatrick who continue to do their best work everyday to run the plants safely and reliably amid the uncertainty of the plants' future and the additional burden of preparing for 2 possible paths forward. They continued to show a first rate level of professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition.
What I've said so far you can see that we've accomplished a lot to achieve our objectives, and our employees continue to do so by meeting our obligations to the communities we serve. These communities are home to both our customers and our employees, along with our owners represent our 40 stakeholders. When we by serving all 4 of our stakeholders are we truly successful. In just the last few weeks, we've received recognition from 3 different organizations for our civic minded approach to doing business. 
First, I'm proud to say that Entergy Corporation was recently named to the Civic 50, an initiative of points of light, honoring the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation. Being named to the Civic 50 acknowledges the number of ways our employees power life for all of our stakeholders. 
Our team members not only provide reliable and affordable electric power and gas to customers, but also actively supports strategic initiatives that support improved educational and employment opportunities, boost economic development and protect the environment.
It was also been awarded the Award from the Employee Support Of the Garden Reserve Louisiana Committee for promoting supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. And finally, our legal department was recently named the Recipient of the 2016 Pro Bono Partner Award from the Pro Bono Institute. This national award recognizes innovative team approaches to pro bono work involving in-house legal departments.
In the partnership with the Louisiana Civil Justice Center and the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, our lawyers helped to establish and staff the self-help Resource Center. We are pleased that with the assistance of our law department the Self-Help Resource Center has to date, we've been able to serve more than 10,000 vulnerable citizens who otherwise would not have access to legal assistance. 
Each of these awards shows that we do our company as part of a broader community. In its recent study conducted by Market Strategies International, Entergy was designated a Most Trusted Brand in 2016, ranking first among electric utilities.
Our employees work hard every day to earn the trust of our customers and in our border communities. 
I'd also like to acknowledge the nearly 3,200 workers who helped with our recent storm restoration efforts. Severe storms, lighting and high winds left 170,000 customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi without power. Roughly 800 of our own Entergy employees partnered with 2,500 linemen, vegetation workers and support personnel from 15 states. 
Power was restored to more than 90% of affected customers in less than 3 days. Times like these are when our people truly shines. These and other actions we take everyday are the way that we power life.
In summary, this was a very solid quarter. Our financial results with our adjusted utility parent and other earning increasing 35% versus last year and our accomplishments toward implementing our investment plan to benefit customers and our continued strategic actions at EWC provide a clear path toward our objectives. 
Our results for the first half of 2016 have demonstrated our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. And so with our objectives for strategy firmly in place, we continue down this path to pursue steady predictable growth of the utility, while reducing the EWC footprint. 
For the second half of 2016, we look forward to continue to deliver solid results for each of our 4 stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

I'll start with the key takeaways on Slide 4.

Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the key takeaways on Slide 4. 
Quickly pointed at the top right corner for our core business, Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings for the quarter came in strong, 35% above last year and in line with what we expected. As you may recall, our adjusted view removes special items, weather and tax effects. 
Our full year view of Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings remain on target with our original guidance. 
Looking at the bottom left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat after normalizing income taxes.
Turning to details beginning on Slide 5. The blue bars show our consolidated operational earnings, which were $3.11 per share in the current period. This compares to $0.83 a year ago. This quarter's results were higher than last year due to a few factors, most significant of which was income taxes, which increased earnings about $2 per share net of customers sharing. 
While this tax items are beneficial and we previously discussed their potential, they were not included in our original guidance due to their uncertainty. 
In the current period, as reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close, these special items include the portion of the proceeds we received during the quarter for DOE litigation as we talked about at Analyst Day in June as well as severance and retention costs and capital spending, which were expensed because the plants are impaired. 
Operational earnings per share for Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.92 quarter-over-quarter, shown on Slide 6.
Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view excluding the effects of weather and income tax items, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.31. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investment to benefit customers and improves returns. 
Specific drivers include the Union Power Station acquisition and Entergy Arkansas rate case. 
Also contributing to the earnings increase was a nonfuel expense, which declined on lower cost spending and decreased compensation and benefits expense.
Utility, Parent & Other's increase and as reported income included $0.68 for income taxes, net of approximately $0.06 for additional customers sharing reflected in that revenue. 
During the quarter, we result tax matters within the 2010, 2011 audit. As a result, we recognize tax items totaling approximately $135 million. There will be tax items come for other businesses purposes that are important to us because they provide real benefits. For example, tax sharing has reduced customer bills more than $300 million over the past 14 years.
Turning to EWC's second quarter results, summarized on Slide 7, operational earnings were $1.34 in the current quarter compared to a slight loss a year ago. A $238 million reduction in income tax expense from the tax collection accounted for virtually all of EWC's earnings this quarter. 
Excluding this item, EWC's earnings would have been $0.01, slightly higher than last year. Effects from 2015 impairments and lower nonfuel O&M expense were largely offset by lower prices and volume for EWC's nuclear fleet. 
Slide 8 shows operating cash flow this quarter of $719 million, slightly lower than the same quarter in 2015.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 9. As you can see, we are affirming our original guidance for Utility, Parent & Other and adjusted EPS of $4.20 to $4.50, with expectations still around the middle of the guidance range. As we mentioned at Analyst Day, we improved incremental nuclear spending for this year, and we expect to mitigate those costs with a number of items across the business. This is reflected in our affirmation of 2016 guidance today.
We are also updating our consolidated Entergy operational guidance range of $6.60 to $7.40 for the $7 per share midpoint. This update is due largely to the income tax items recorded in the second quarter. Absent those tax items and consistent with our previous discussions, we would expect to be around the bottom of the original guidance range  due  primarily to the unfavorable weather and the extended outage of the [indiscernible] 2 and lower market prices. To be clear, we do not expect additional significant income taxes for the remainder of this year.
I'll also note that while industrial sales growth has been strong at 6.7% for the first half of the year, we expect this to taper off in the second half of 2016, particularly from our biggest segment, Refiners, as they ran very well in the third and fourth quarters of last year and they're expected to have a number of maintenance outages this fall. In addition, you may recall that high product inventory levels and a strong dollar contributed to a temporary negative industrial growth in the second quarter of last year. 
Similar macro factors and supply/demand rebalancing in oil markets may present challenging for U.S. refiners for the fall. As a reminder, 6 demand charges represent about 50% of our industrial revenue and it extend we see volatility in sales for existing large industrial customers, the revenue impact should be small. 
Beyond the fall, we continue to see new and expanding customer growth for the next few years.
Moving to the longer term view, Slide 10 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook for 2017 through 2019, which is unchanged. I'll reiterate that our current outlook reflects engine discount rate assumptions from earlier in the year, which were 4.75% at 2017, 5% in '18 and 5.25% in '19.
As a point of reference, our recent forward test year FRB filing for Entergy Arkansas assumed a 4.25% pension discount rate in 2017. 
If you look at the market today, that rate would be closer to 4% or perhaps even lower. 
Also, 2017, 2018 and 2019 do not currently include the effects of the Nuclear Sustainability Plan or expected mitigations in rate treatment. As we have said, investing in a long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets preserve the benefit of nuclear for our stakeholders is an important part of the utility strategy.
We are working to identify the cost mitigations, but to the extent we are not completely successful about the time we get to 2019, we will have gone through a rate proceeding in each of the affected jurisdictions and we believe that these prudently incurred costs and expected mitigations should be reflected in rates. As such, our long-term earnings plan, 2019 and beyond, should not be significantly affected by the Nuclear Sustainability Plan. 
As we committed at Analyst Day, we will provide a full update, including all of these items at EAI later this year.
Slide 11 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook assuming market prices as of the end of the quarter. Our current estimates reflect market prices as of June 30. And as you know, prices have come down a bit since then. 
Before I close, I'd like to highlight 2 items. Last week, Moody's Investor Services changed Entergy Mississippi's rating outlook to positive from stable. Moody's specifically noted EMI successful implementation of its formula rate plan and forward-looking features. Moody's views the FRB as a significant credit positive as it provide a dependable and clear framework for timely operating cost recovery. 
Also during the quarter, we completed several refinancings, issuing $840 million of operating company debt and average coupon of 3.1%. The majority of the issuances were economic refinancings, which replaced about $660 million of debt with an average rate of 6.1%, creating annual interest savings of about $20 million pretax.
These interest savings will help offset the effect of the potentially lower-than-planned pension discount rate.
As Leo mentioned, results through the first half of the year have been solid and in line with our growth expectations for our core Utility, Parent & Other business. That said, we know we still a work to do to achieve our longer-term aspirations, and we will continue to work toward that end. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your question."

Do you view this as a multi-year, 3 to 5, 5 to 7-year issue? And what got you to this point, relative to where it seems like the industry trade group is talking about?"

And we've been proceeding down that path for the last several years. The only thing that changes from time to time is the methodology we would use. So for example, we look at New England and something like from 1 Yankee, for example, separation came about because prices don't support the economics of the plant, and we were forced into shut it down to the extent that something becomes transactable as part of that separation, certainly that's a preferable route as it was with the Rhode Island State Energy Center when we sold that and if we're successful to sell Fitzpatrick. So I'll say it again, it does impact, I would guess, the probability distribution of prices it might receive. We still believe that we're going to get the plant relicensed, so that we'd indicate a long life of the plant. And then the other aspect it was always -- has always been part of transacting, which was part of the benefit with regulatory approvals that we would require to get something done. All those are the same. We're just incrementally changing the dynamic as we proceed down the licensing pathway to be successful or if something like this occurs where, again, it changes the downside price risk."

Strong growth in our core business, absent any impact of taxes or weather, was coupled with significant accomplishment. We spent the first half of 2016 working to execute on our strategy, and the results we are reporting today are a reflection of that work. We've made progress towards meeting our objective of steady, predictable growth at the Utility while reducing our EWC footprint. We delivered solid results through the first half of the year.
Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased 35% this quarter versus last year and are in line with our growth expectations for our core business. Most importantly, we continue to set up the business to achieve our longer term targets. Our extensive 2016 to-do list on Slide 3 is a road map of the execution of our strategy, and it's a good way to illustrate some of what we've accomplished.
At the Utility, we received a favorable ALJ recommendation for the St. Charles Power Station. The result of the Entergy Louisiana request for proposal was announced with the self-build alternative and one long-term power purchase agreement selected. The self-build alternative was also selected in the Entergy Texas request for proposal.
Entergy New Orleans filed for approval for a new gas-fired combustion turbine. Entergy Mississippi received a revenue increase under its first formula rate plan. Filing with forward-looking features, Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year formula rate plan filing. Entergy Arkansas made its first full test year formula rate filing. Entergy Texas received approval on its transmission cost recovery factor rider. We received the confirmatory action letter from the NRC for ANO, and the letter is consistent with our expectation, and we saw over 7% industrial growth versus last year. At EWC, we entered into negotiations for the sale of our FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant. Finally, we met with many of you on our Analyst Day in June where we highlighted our progress towards effectively shifting our investment profile to a pure-play Utility.
We're achieving this shift by continuing to invest in the Utility for the benefit of our customers while maintaining reasonable rates. One of these investments is the St. Charles Power Station project, which received a favorable recommendation from the administrative law judge in July. We expect the certification decision from the LPSC in August. We're encouraged with the ALJ's recommendation that the project serves the public convenience and necessity and is in the public interest. The ALJ further recommends that Entergy Louisiana's decision to commence construction is prudent, and the selection of the project is consistent with the terms of the LPSC's market-based mechanisms order.
We also continue to make progress for our plans for a CCGT in Texas. In April, the RFP process resulted in the selection of the self-build alternative, and in the third quarter, we we'll begin the necessary filings for regulatory approval. We are on a similar path in Louisiana where the RFP process also resulted in the selection of the self-build alternative, and we expect to make the necessary regulatory filings in the third quarter. That same RFP resulted in the selection of a long-term power purchase agreement for an existing CCGT resource, and we also plan to seek approval of the PPA from the LPSC.
Entergy New Orleans has filed an application with New Orleans City Council seeking approval to build the New Orleans Power Station, a natural gas-fired combustion turbine plant at the existing issued site. This request follows the early June deactivations of our 1960's era Michoud units 2 and 3. These units are a prime example of the aging infrastructure in our service territory. The decision to deactivate these units was based on economics, maintenance and operational considerations. A new plan will provide a long-term local resource that can meet the city's particular resource needs at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. We've requested strategic council approve by January -- approval by January 31, 2017. If approved as requested, the new plan is expected to be placed in service in the second half of 2019.
These investments will provide more cost-effective, reliable and efficient generating resources for our customers. By building these plants, we will reduce the average age of our fleet and improve the heat rate in key areas of our system. For example, by 2025, in the WOTAB region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by approximately 19 years. Also in the Amite South region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by 18 years. And with new units operating at key rates of less than 7,000, the efficiency of our fossil generation portfolio will be improved by roughly 800 BTU per kWh fleet-wide by 2025. Additionally, the new CCGT units will, on average, produce 41% fewer carbon dioxide emissions in our Legacy gas units.
In addition to addressing our aging infrastructure, we also need to control fuel volatility in our customer's builds. Our nuclear assets are critical to this objective as they provide valuable fuel diversity to our utility fleet. The low volatility of nuclear fuel price effectively access a hedge against the high volatility of natural gas prices. Beyond fuel diversity, our nuclear assets also provide other significant benefits as large scale virtually emissions-free resources, these assets minimize our environmental footprint with high-capacity factors and provide stable baseload generation.
Nuclear generation also offers a host of economic benefits and contributes to the financial health of the communities in which these assets sit, including thousands of good paying jobs, tax benefits to local state and federal governments and billions of dollars in economic output.
Investing in the long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to preserve these benefits for our 4 stakeholders is an important part of our Utility strategy. We've drafted the framework for our nuclear sustainability plan that will preserve these benefits, and that framework is now under external peer review. We're working on firming up the cost estimates and steps for implementation. We are currently on track with our commitment to provide you even more specifics at EEI this November.
We also have a path-forward at Arkansas Nuclear 1. The NRC issued its confirmatory action letter shortly after our Analyst Day and adopted our proposed comprehensive recovery plan. The letter confirmed that the planned redevelop will lead us to sustained performance improvement. We will work diligently to complete the agreed upon actions listed in the letter to the satisfaction of the NRC. We believe we will be able to demonstrate to the NRC our ability to exit Column IV as early as late 2017.
However, our goal is not to simply exit Column IV, but to return to sustained operational excellence and to be considered one of the industry's strongest performers.
We're rounding other generation portfolio with renewable and energy initiatives I talked about last quarter. Entergy New Orleans' solar generation project with battery storage technology was placed in service in June. Entergy Arkansas' power purchase agreement will support construction. We have an 81-megawatt solar energy generating facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018. Entergy Mississippi's 3 new solar installations are online and capable of generating 500 KWH. And we have 3 renewable requests for proposals outstanding at Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. In the Arkansas and New Orleans RFPs, bidders will have an opportunity to provide acquisition proposals. And the New Orleans proposal also includes a self-build option. Proposals are due in August for the Arkansas and Louisiana RFPs and in October for New Orleans RFP. Final selections will be made in December of 2016, February of 2017 and April of 2017 for Louisiana, Arkansas and New Orleans, respectively.
In addition to our generation supply plan, we're also executing on our transmission investment plan. In Arkansas, we placed in service a new 23-mile 230 kV line and completed a new 500 kV substation to serve Big River Steel. These 2 projects represent over $100 million of investment. In Mississippi, we completed a new distribution substation and kicked off 2 new projects for another new substation and 115 kV line additions and upgrades. These new projects are expected to be in service in 2017, in total, nearly $75 million of investment. And in Texas, we placed 3 major projects in service between May and July, which totaled roughly $140 million in investment.
These are just a few examples of major transmission projects that facilitate improved system liability, compliance with NERC standards, enhanced economic development with reduced transmission congestion. And all of these factors can ultimately contribute to a lower cost of service for our customers.
At Analyst Day, we focused on investing in new technology to migrate towards a flexible, reliable and innovative integrated energy network. We're beginning the first phases of this process with advanced meters that change the way we manage our distribution system, reducing operating costs and providing savings for customers.
Since Analyst Day, we finalized our vendor and technology partners and have initiated the design phase of our project. Regulatory filings are expected to begin in September with the first filing to be made before the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Filings in other jurisdictions will follow.
Advanced metering is a foundational technology that supports other technologies to reduce costs and provide customers greater control and options over their energy usage. We've initiated a great engineering study to assess the best path forward, incorporating these technologies in an integrated energy network for each of the operating companies. We will provide more information in due course.
These investments in technology and infrastructure deliver the same benefits as our more traditional investments in generation and transmission, namely a more efficient electric system with enhanced electric liability and reduced environmental footprint and reduced cost to serve our customers.
Over the past couple of years, we've improved our regulatory constructs to give us the ability to make investments that support economic development, create jobs, improve reliability in our systems and reduce our environmental impact. With many of those constricts now in place, we've moved into a rhythm of filing annual formula rate plans.
Entergy Mississippi received an order approving the revenue increase for its first FRP filing with forward-looking features, and rate adjustments were implemented at the end of June. Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year FRP filing at the end of May. And last month, Entergy Arkansas made its first FRP filing with a forward test year.
And at Entergy Texas, we've been working on the implementation of the transmission cost recovery factor. We received approval on this rider in late June, and recovery of transmission spend through this rider will relate back to April 14th.
I'll take a moment now to talk briefly about EWC, starting with an update on Pilgrim, which is currently preparing for its NRC inspection. Many of the same team members who put together the comprehensive recovery plan for ANO are working on the plans for program. We expect to be ready for the NRC to conduct its inspection this fall with the confirmatory action letter potentially to be issued in the spring.
And finally, in mid-July, we announced that we are in discussions with Exelon on the sale of our FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant. The opportunity to change the future of FitzPatrick has significant positive impact on our employees and the surrounding communities, and we're willing to consider any viable options to keeping the plant to open. In that spirit, we applaud The New York PSC's decision to adopt the clean energy standard program. It is a critical component of a potential transaction. We are reviewing the order to confirm it addresses the issues we'd hope, but at this point, we are very encouraged.
As negotiations for sale continue, we continue to proceed along 2 parallel paths, preparing for the plants' permanent shutdown and decommissioning under the current plan, while also preparing for a possible refueling and continued operation in the event of the sale. We are hopeful that negotiations can be completed this month.
Regardless of the outcome, our focus continues to be on the safe and reliable operation of the plant for as long as it continues to operate. We will also do our best to support our employees in the community throughout this transition, whether that leads to a sale to a new owner or the safe shutdown and decommissioning of the plant.
I'd like to thank our hundreds of employees at FitzPatrick who continue to do their best work everyday to run the plants safely and reliably amid the uncertainty of the plants' future and the additional burden of preparing for 2 possible paths forward. They continue to show a first rate level of professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition.
What I've said so far, you can see that we've accomplished a lot to achieve our objectives, and our employees continue to do so by meeting our obligations to the communities we serve. These communities are home to both our customers and our employees, along with our owners who represent our 4 key stakeholders. Only by serving all 4 of our stakeholders are we truly successful. In just the last few weeks, we've received recognition from 3 different organizations for our civic minded approach to doing business.
First, I'm proud to say that Entergy Corporation was recently named to the Civic 50, an initiative of Points of Light, honoring the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation. Being named to the Civic 50 acknowledges the number of ways our employees power life for all of our stakeholders. 
Our team members not only provide reliable and affordable electric power and gas to customers, but also actively support strategic initiatives that support improved educational and employment opportunities, boost economic development and protect the environment.
We've also been awarded the Pro Patria Award from the Employer Support Of the Guard and Reserve Louisiana Committee for promoting supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. And finally, our legal department was recently named the Recipient of the 2016 Pro Bono Partner Award from the Pro Bono Institute. This national award recognizes innovative team approaches to pro bono work involving in-house legal departments.
In a partnership with Louisiana Civil Justice Center and the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, our lawyers helped to establish and staff the Self-Help Resource Center. We are pleased that with the assistance of our law department, the Self-Help Resource Center has, to date, been able to serve more than 10,000 vulnerable citizens who otherwise would not have access to legal assistance.
Each of these awards shows that we view our company as part of a broader community. In a recent study conducted by Market Strategies International, Entergy was designated a Most Trusted Brand in 2016, ranking first among electric utilities.
Our employees work hard every day to earn the trust of our customers and our broader communities.
I'd also like to acknowledge the nearly 3,200 workers who helped with our recent storm restoration efforts. Severe storms, lighting and high winds left 170,000 customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi without power. Roughly 800 of our own Entergy employees partnered with 2,500 linemen, vegetation workers and support personnel from 15 states. Power was restored to more than 90% of affected customers in less than 3 days. Times like these are when our people truly shine. These and other actions we take everyday are the way that we power life.
In summary, this was a very solid quarter. Our financial results with our adjusted Utility, Parent & other earning increasing 35% versus last year and our accomplishments toward implementing our investment plan to benefit customers and our continued strategic actions at EWC provide a clear path toward our objectives.
Our results for the first half of 2016 have demonstrated our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. And so with our objectives and strategy firmly in place, we'll continue down this path to pursue steady, predictable growth of the Utility, while reducing the EWC footprint.
For the second half of 2016, we look forward to continuing to deliver solid results for each of our 4 stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

I'll start with the key takeaways on Slide 4. Quickly pointing to the top right corner for our core business, Utility, Parent & Others adjusted earnings for the quarter came in strong, 35% above last year, and in li",1324,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the key takeaways on Slide 4. Quickly pointing to the top right corner for our core business, Utility, Parent & Others adjusted earnings for the quarter came in strong, 35% above last year, and in line with what we expected. As you may recall, our adjusted view removes special items, weather and tax effects. Our full year view of Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings remains on target with our original guidance. Looking at the bottom left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat after normalizing income taxes.
Turning to details, beginning on Slide 5. The blue bars show our consolidated operational earnings, which were $3.11 per share in the current period. This compares to $0.83 a year ago. This quarter's results were higher than last year due to a few factors, most significant of which was income taxes, which increased earnings about $2 per share net of customer sharing.
While these tax items are beneficial, and we previously discussed their potential, they were not included in our original guidance due to their uncertainty.
In the current period, as-reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close. These special items include a portion of the proceeds we received during the quarter for DOE litigation as we talked about at Analyst Day in June as well as severance and retention costs and capital spending, which were expensed because the plants are impaired.
Operational earnings per share for Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.92 quarter-over-quarter, shown on Slide 6.
Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, excluding the effects of weather and income tax items, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.31. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investment that benefits customers and improves returns. Specific drivers include the Union Power Station acquisition and Entergy Arkansas rate case.
Also contributing to the earnings increase was a nonfuel expense, which declined on lower cost spending and decreased compensation and benefits expense.
Utility, Parent & Others increase and as reported income included $0.68 for income taxes, net of approximately $0.06 for additional customers sharing reflected in that revenue.
During the quarter, we resolved result tax matters within the 2010-2011 audit. As a result, we recognize tax items totaling approximately $135 million. There will be tax items come about for other businesses purposes. They're important to us because they provide real benefits. For example, tax sharing has reduced customer bills more than $300 million over the past 14 years.
Turning to EWC's second quarter results, summarized on Slide 7. Operational earnings were $1.34 in the current quarter compared to a slight loss a year ago. A $238 million reduction in income tax expense from a tax election accounted for virtually all of EWC's earnings this quarter.
Excluding this item, EWC's earnings would have been $0.01 slightly higher than last year. Effects from 2015 impairments and lower nonfuel O&M expense were largely offset by lower prices and volume for EWC's nuclear fleet.
Slide 8 shows operating cash flow this quarter of $719 million, slightly lower than the same quarter in 2015.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 9. As you can see, we are affirming our original guidance for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $4.20 to $4.50 with expectations still around the middle of the guidance range. As we mentioned at Analyst Day, we've improved incremental nuclear spending for this year, and we expect to mitigate those costs with a number of items across the business. This is reflected in our affirmation of 26 (sic) [ 2016 ] guidance today.
We are also updating our consolidated Entergy operational guidance range of $6.60 to $7.40 for the $7 per share midpoint. This update is due largely to the income tax items recorded in the second quarter. Absent those tax items and consistent with our previous discussions, we would expect to be around the bottom of the original guidance range due primarily to unfavorable weather, the extended outage of Indian Point 2 and lower market prices. To be clear, we do not expect additional significant income taxes for the remainder of this year.
I'll also note that while industrial sales growth has been strong at 6.7% for the first half of the year, we expect this to taper off in the second half of 2016, particularly from our biggest segment, Refiners, as they ran very well in the third and fourth quarters of last year, and they're expected to have a number of maintenance outages this fall. In addition, you may recall that high product inventory levels and a strong dollar contributed to a temporary negative industrial growth in the second quarter of last year.
Similar macro factors and supply/demand rebalancing in oil markets may present challenging for U.S. refiners in the fall. As a reminder, 6 demand charges represent about 50% of our industrial revenue and to the extent we see volatility in sales from existing large industrial customers, the revenue impact should be small. Beyond the fall, we continue to see new and expanding customer growth for the next few years.
Moving to the longer term view. Slide 10 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook for 2017 through 2019, which is unchanged. I'll reiterate that our current outlook reflects pension discount rate assumptions from earlier in the year, which were 4.75% in 2017, 5% in '18 and 5.25% in '19. As a point of reference, our recent forward test year FRP filing for Entergy Arkansas assumed a 4.25% pension discount rate in 2017. If you looked at the market today, that rate would be closer to 4% or perhaps even lower.
Also, 2017, 2018 and 2019 do not currently include the effects of the Nuclear Sustainability Plan or expected mitigations in rate treatment. As we have said, investing in a long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to preserve the benefit of nuclear for our stakeholders is an important part of Utility strategy.
We are working to identify the cost mitigations, but to the extent we are not completely successful. By the time we get to 2019, we've gone through a rate proceeding in each of the affected jurisdictions, and we believe that these prudently incurred costs and expected mitigations should be reflected in rates. As such, our long-term earnings plan, 2019 and beyond, should not be significantly affected by the Nuclear Sustainability Plan. As we committed at Analyst Day, we will provide a full update, including all of these items at EEI later this year.
Slide 11 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook assuming market prices as of the end of the quarter. Our current estimates reflect market prices as of June 30, and as you know, prices have come down a bit since then.
Before I close, I'd like to highlight 2 items. Last week, Moody's Investor Services changed Entergy Mississippi's rating outlook to positive from stable. Moody's specifically noted EMI successful implementation of its formula rate plan with forward-looking features. Moody's views the FRP as a significant credit positive since it provides a dependable and clear framework for timely operating cost recovery.
Also during the quarter, we completed several refinancings, issuing $840 million of operating company debt at an average coupon of 3.1%. The majority of the issuances were economic refinancings, which replaced about $660 million of debt with an average rate of 6.1%, creating annual interest savings of about $20 million pretax. These interest savings will help offset the effect of the potentially lower-than-planned pension discount rate.
As Leo mentioned, results through the first half of the year have been solid and in line with our growth expectations for our core Utility, Parent & Other business. That said, we still -- we know we still have work to do to achieve our longer-term aspirations, and we will continue to work toward that end.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

There is certainly not everything that we would have -- that we will likely identify associated with integrated energy network. There is probably more out there associated with that. It think we referenced toward the backend or beyond that time horizon we've been talking at Analyst Day. We mentioned the $6 billion to $8 billion number at that point in time, but that, obviously, goes up beyond the period we're talking here now. Also in the world of gas price volatility, et cetera, where there's nothing in there for anything, we might do the hedge that if you were to include investments and the like and the potential for where we come out on some of the renewable RFPs, et cetera. So when you get to the backend and certainly and beyond it, there is a significant amount of other things that we're investigating, that could be part of the capital program in addition to what we need. And again, as we've mentioned before, we've got a pretty solid generation and transmission capital program. And we're doing that from a position, as we've mentioned before, being short generation across the system, and we would continue to anticipate that, that would be short across the system as we go forward and these capital investments create a significant amount of benefits to our customers. And as it relates to reduced congestion, lower production cost, lower emissions, you name it, particularly given the age of our fleet, these things are really, really beneficial to our customers."

And we've been proceeding down that path for the last several years. The only thing that changes from time to time is the methodology we would use. So for example, when we look at New England and something like from I Yankee, for example, separation came about because prices didn't support the economics of the plant, and we were forced into shutting it down to the extent that something becomes transactable as part of that separation, certainly, that's a preferable route as it was with Rhode Island State Energy Center when we sold that and if we're successful to be able to sell Fitzpatrick. So I'll say this again, it does impact, I would guess, the probability distribution of prices it might receive. We still believe that we're going to get the plant relicensed, so that would indicate a long life of the plant. And then the other aspect, it was always -- has always been part of transacting, which was part of the spin, was regulatory approvals that we would require to get something done. All those are the same. We just -- we're incrementally changing the dynamic as we proceed down the relicensing pathway to be successful or if something like this occurs where, again, it changes the downside price risk."

By any measure, this was a solid quarter. Strong growth in our core business, absent any impact of taxes or weather, was coupled with significant accomplishment. We spent the first half of 2016 working to exec",2717,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. By any measure, this was a solid quarter. Strong growth in our core business, absent any impact of taxes or weather, was coupled with significant accomplishment. We spent the first half of 2016 working to execute on our strategy, and the results we are reporting today are a reflection of that work. We've made progress towards meeting our objective of steady, predictable growth at the Utility while reducing our EWC footprint. We delivered solid results through the first half of the year.
Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased 35% this quarter versus last year and are in line with our growth expectations for our core business. Most importantly, we continue to set up the business to achieve our longer term targets. Our extensive 2016 to-do list on Slide 3 is a road map of the execution of our strategy, and it's a good way to illustrate some of what we've accomplished.
At the Utility, we received a favorable ALJ recommendation for the St. Charles Power Station. The result of the Entergy Louisiana request for proposal was announced with the self-build alternative and one long-term power purchase agreement selected. The self-build alternative was also selected in the Entergy Texas request for proposal. Entergy New Orleans filed for approval for a new gas-fired combustion turbine. Entergy Mississippi received a revenue increase under its first formula rate plan filing with forward-looking features. Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year formula rate plan filing. Entergy Arkansas made its first forward test year formula rate filing. Entergy Texas received approval on its transmission cost recovery factor rider. We received the confirmatory action letter from the NRC for ANO, and the letter is consistent with our expectation, and we saw over 7% industrial growth versus last year. At EWC, we entered into negotiations for the sale of our FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant. 
Finally, we met with many of you on our Analyst Day in June where we highlighted our progress towards effectively shifting our investment profile to a pure-play Utility. We're achieving this shift by continuing to invest in the Utility for the benefit of our customers while maintaining reasonable rates. One of these investments is the St. Charles Power Station project, which received a favorable recommendation from the administrative law judge in July. We expect the certification decision from the LPSC in August. We're encouraged with the ALJ's recommendation that the project serves the public convenience and necessity and is in the public interest. The ALJ further recommends that Entergy Louisiana's decision to commence construction is prudent, and the selection of the project is consistent with the terms of the LPSC's market-based mechanisms order.
We also continue to make progress for our plans for a CCGT in Texas. In April, the RFP process resulted in the selection of the self-build alternative, and in the third quarter, we will begin the necessary filings for regulatory approval. We are on a similar path in Louisiana where the RFP process also resulted in the selection of the self-build alternative, and we expect to make the necessary regulatory filings in the third quarter. That same RFP resulted in the selection of a long-term power purchase agreement for an existing CCGT resource, and we also plan to seek approval of the PPA from the LPSC.
Entergy New Orleans has filed an application with New Orleans City Council seeking approval to build the New Orleans Power Station, a natural gas-fired combustion turbine plant at the existing Michoud site. This request follows the early June deactivations of our 1960's era Michoud units 2 and 3. These units are a prime example of the aging infrastructure in our service territory. The decision to deactivate these units was based on economics, maintenance and operational considerations. The new plan will provide a long-term local resource that can meet the city's particular resource needs at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. We've requested the city council approve by January -- approval by January 31, 2017. If approved, as requested, the new plan is expected to be placed in service in the second half of 2019.
These investments will provide more cost-effective, reliable and efficient generating resources for our customers. By building these plants, we will reduce the average age of our fleet and improve the heat rate in key areas of our system. For example, by 2025, in the WOTAB region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by approximately 19 years. Also in the Amite South region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by 18 years. And with new units operating at heat rates of less than 7,000, the efficiency of our fossil generation portfolio will be improved by roughly 800 BTUs per kWh fleet-wide by 2025. Additionally, the new CCGT units will, on average, produce 41% fewer carbon dioxide emissions in our Legacy gas units.
In addition to addressing our aging infrastructure, we also need to control fuel volatility in our customers' bills. Our nuclear assets are critical to this objective as they provide valuable fuel diversity to our utility fleet. The low volatility of nuclear fuel price effectively acts as a hedge against the high volatility of natural gas prices. Beyond fuel diversity, our nuclear assets also provide other significant benefits. As large scale virtually emissions-free resources, these assets minimize our environmental footprint, run at high-capacity factors and provide stable baseload generation.
Nuclear generation also offers a host of economic benefits and contributes to the financial health of the communities in which these assets sit, including thousands of good paying jobs, tax benefits to local state and federal governments and billions of dollars in economic output.
Investing in the long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to preserve these benefits for our 4 stakeholders is an important part of our Utility strategy. We've drafted the framework for our nuclear sustainability plan that will preserve these benefits, and that framework is now under external peer review. We're working on firming up the cost estimates and steps for implementation. We are currently on track with our commitment to provide you even more specifics at EEI this November.
We also have a path-forward at Arkansas Nuclear One. The NRC issued its confirmatory action letter shortly after our Analyst Day and adopted our proposed comprehensive recovery plan. The letter confirmed that the planned redeveloped will lead us to sustained performance improvement. We will work diligently to complete the agreed upon actions listed in the letter to the satisfaction of the NRC. We believe we will be able to demonstrate to the NRC our ability to exit Column 4 as early as late 2017. However, our goal is not to simply exit Column 4, but to return to sustained operational excellence and to be considered one of the industry's strongest performers.
We're rounding out our generation portfolio with renewable and energy initiatives I talked about last quarter. Entergy New Orleans' solar generation project with battery storage technology was placed in service in June. Entergy Arkansas' power purchase agreement will support construction. We have an 81-megawatt solar energy generating facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018. Entergy Mississippi's 3 new solar installations are online and capable of generating 500 kWh. And we have 3 renewable requests for proposals outstanding at Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. In the Arkansas and New Orleans RFPs, bidders will have an opportunity to provide acquisition proposals. And the New Orleans proposal also includes a self-build option. Proposals are due in August for the Arkansas and Louisiana RFPs and in October for the New Orleans RFP. Final selections will be made in December of 2016, February of 2017 and April of 2017 for Louisiana, Arkansas and New Orleans, respectively.
In addition to our generation supply plan, we're also executing on our transmission investment plan. In Arkansas, we placed in service a new 23-mile 230 kV line and completed a new 500 kV substation to serve Big River Steel. These 2 projects represent over $100 million of investment. In Mississippi, we completed a new distribution substation and kicked off 2 new projects for another new substation and 115 kV line additions and upgrades. These new projects are expected to be in service in 2017, in total, nearly $75 million of investment. And in Texas, we placed 3 major projects in service between May and July, which totaled roughly $140 million in investment.
These are just a few examples of major transmission projects that facilitate improved system reliability, compliance with NERC standards, enhanced economic development or reduced transmission congestion. And all of these factors can ultimately contribute to a lower cost of service for our customers.
At Analyst Day, we focused on investing in new technology to migrate towards a flexible, reliable and innovative integrated energy network. We're beginning the first phases of this process with advanced meters that change the way we manage our distribution system, reducing operating costs and providing savings for customers.
Since Analyst Day, we finalized our vendor and technology partners and have initiated the design phase of our project. Regulatory filings are expected to begin in September with the first filing to be made before the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Filings in other jurisdictions will follow.
Advanced metering is a foundational technology that supports other technologies to reduce costs and provide customers greater control and options over their energy usage. We've initiated a great engineering study to assess the best path forward, incorporating these technologies in an integrated energy network for each of the operating companies. We will provide more information in due course.
These investments in technology and infrastructure deliver the same benefits as our more traditional investments in generation and transmission, namely a more efficient electric system with enhanced electric reliability and reduced environmental footprint and reduced cost to serve our customers.
Over the past couple of years, we've improved our regulatory constructs to give us the ability to make investments that support economic development, create jobs, improve reliability in our systems and reduce our environmental impact. With many of those constricts now in place, we've moved into a rhythm of filing annual formula rate plans.
Entergy Mississippi received an order approving the revenue increase for its first FRP filing with forward-looking features, and rate adjustments were implemented at the end of June. Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year FRP filing at the end of May. And last month, Entergy Arkansas made its first FRP filing with a forward test year. And at Entergy Texas, we've been working on the implementation of the transmission cost recovery factor. We received approval on this rider in late June, and recovery of transmission spend through this rider will relate back to April 14th.
I'll take a moment now to talk briefly about EWC, starting with an update on Pilgrim, which is currently preparing for its NRC inspection. Many of the same team members who put together the comprehensive recovery plan for ANO are working on a plan for Pilgrim. We expect to be ready for the NRC to conduct its inspection this fall with the confirmatory action letter potentially to be issued in the spring.
And finally, in mid-July, we announced that we are in discussions with Exelon on the sale of our FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant. The opportunity to change the future of FitzPatrick has a significant positive impact on our employees in the surrounding communities, and we're willing to consider any viable options to keeping the plant to open. In that spirit, we applaud The New York PSC's decision to adopt the clean energy standard program. It is a critical component of a potential transaction. We are reviewing the order to confirm it addresses the issues we'd hope, but at this point, we are very encouraged.
As negotiations for sale continue, we continue to proceed along 2 parallel paths, preparing for the plants' permanent shutdown and decommissioning under the current plan, while also preparing for a possible refueling and continued operation in the event of the sale. We are hopeful that negotiations can be completed this month.
Regardless of the outcome, our focus continues to be on the safe and reliable operation of the plant for as long as it continues to operate. We will also do our best to support our employees in the community throughout this transition, whether that leads to a sale to a new owner or the safe shutdown and decommissioning of the plant.
I'd like to thank our hundreds of employees at FitzPatrick who continue to do their best work every day to run the plants safely and reliably amid the uncertainty of the plant's future and the additional burden of preparing for 2 possible paths forward. They continue to show a first-rate level of professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition.
From what I've said so far, you can see that we've accomplished a lot to achieve our objectives, and our employees continue to do so by meeting our obligations to the communities we serve. These communities are home to both our customers and our employees who, along with our owners, represent our 4 key stakeholders. Only by serving all 4 of our stakeholders are we truly successful. In just the last few weeks, we've received recognition from 3 different organizations for our civic minded approach to doing business.
First, I'm proud to say that Entergy Corporation was recently named to the Civic 50, an initiative of Points of Light, honoring the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation. Being named to the Civic 50 acknowledges the number of ways our employees power life for all of our stakeholders. Our team members not only provide reliable and affordable electric power and gas to customers, but also actively support strategic initiatives that support improved educational and employment opportunities, boost economic development and protect the environment.
We've also been awarded the Pro Patria Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, Louisiana Committee, for promoting supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. And finally, our legal department was recently named the recipient of the 2016 Pro Bono Partner Award from the Pro Bono Institute. This national award recognizes innovative team approaches to pro bono work involving in-house legal departments. In a partnership with the Louisiana Civil Justice Center and the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, our lawyers helped to establish and staff the Self Help Resource Center. We are pleased that with the assistance of our law department, the Self Help Resource Center has, to date, been able to serve more than 10,000 vulnerable citizens who otherwise would not have access to legal assistance.
Each of these awards shows that we view our company as part of a broader community. In a recent study conducted by Market Strategies International, Entergy was designated a Most Trusted Brand in 2016, ranking first among electric utilities. Our employees work hard every day to earn the trust of our customers and our broader communities.
I'd also like to acknowledge the nearly 3,200 workers who helped with our recent storm restoration efforts. Severe storms, lighting and high winds left 170,000 customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi without power. Roughly 800 of our own Entergy employees partnered with 2,500 linemen, vegetation workers and support personnel from 15 states. Power was restored to more than 90% of affected customers in less than 3 days. Times like these are when our people truly shine. These and other actions we take every day are the way that we power life.
In summary, this was a very solid quarter. Our financial results with our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other earnings increasing 35% versus last year and our accomplishments towards implementing our investment plan to benefit customers and our continued strategic actions at EWC provide a clear path toward our objectives. Our results for the first half of 2016 have demonstrated our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. And so with our objectives and strategy firmly in place, we'll continue down this path to pursue steady, predictable growth of the Utility, while reducing the EWC footprint. For the second half of 2016, we look forward to continuing to deliver solid results for each of our 4 stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

I'll start with the key takeaways on Slide 4. Quickly pointing to the top right corner for our core business, Utility, Parent & Others adjusted earnings for the quarter came in strong, 35% above last year, and in li",1325,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the key takeaways on Slide 4. Quickly pointing to the top right corner for our core business, Utility, Parent & Others adjusted earnings for the quarter came in strong, 35% above last year, and in line with what we expected. As you may recall, our adjusted view removes special items, weather and tax effects. Our full year view of Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings remained on target with our original guidance. Looking at the bottom left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat after normalizing income taxes.
Turning to the details, beginning on Slide 5. The blue bars show our consolidated operational earnings, which were $3.11 per share in the current period. This compares to $0.83 a year ago. This quarter's results were higher than last year due to a few factors, most significant of which was income taxes, which increased earnings about $2 per share net of customer sharing. While these tax items are beneficial, and we previously discussed their potential, they were not included in our original guidance due to their uncertainty.
In the current period, as-reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close. These special items include a portion of the proceeds we received during the quarter for DOE litigation as we talked about at Analyst Day in June as well as severance and retention costs and capital spending, which were expensed because the plants are impaired.
Operational earnings per share for Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.92 quarter-over-quarter, shown on Slide 6. Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, excluding the effects of weather and income tax items, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.31. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investment that benefits customers and improves returns. Specific drivers include the Union Power Station acquisition and Entergy Arkansas rate case. Also contributing to the earnings increase was non-fuel O&M expense, which declined on lower fossil spending and decreased compensation and benefits expense.
Utility, Parent & Others increase in as-reported income included $0.68 for income taxes, net of approximately $0.06 for additional customer sharing reflected in that revenue.
During the quarter, we resolved result tax matters within the 2010-2011 audit. As a result, we recognized tax items totaling approximately $135 million. Though these tax items come about for other businesses purposes, they are important to us because they provide real benefits. For example, tax sharing has reduced customer bills more than $300 million over the past 14 years.
Turning to EWC's second quarter results, summarized on Slide 7. Operational earnings were $1.34 in the current quarter compared to a slight loss a year ago. A $238 million reduction in income tax expense from a tax election accounted for virtually all of EWC's earnings this quarter. Excluding this item, EWC's earnings would have been $0.01 slightly higher than last year. Effects from 2015 impairments and lower non-fuel O&M expense were largely offset by lower prices and volume for EWC's nuclear fleet.
Slide 8 shows operating cash flow this quarter of $719 million, slightly lower than the same quarter in 2015.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 9. As you can see, we are affirming our original guidance for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $4.20 to $4.50 with expectations still around the middle of the guidance range. As we mentioned at Analyst Day, we've improved incremental nuclear spending for this year, and we expect to mitigate those costs with a number of items across the business. This is reflected in our affirmation of 26 (sic) [ 2016 ] guidance today.
We are also updating our consolidated Entergy operational guidance range of $6.60 to $7.40 with a $7 per share midpoint. This update is due largely to the income tax items recorded in the second quarter. Absent those tax items and consistent with our previous discussions, we would expect to be around the bottom of the original guidance range due primarily to unfavorable weather, the extended outage of Indian Point 2 and lower market prices. To be clear, we do not expect additional significant income taxes for the remainder of this year.
I'll also note that while industrial sales growth has been strong at 6.7% for the first half of the year, we expect this to taper off in the second half of 2016, particularly from our biggest segment, Refiners, as they ran very well in the third and fourth quarters of last year, and they're expected to have a number of maintenance outages this fall. In addition, you may recall that high product inventory levels and a strong dollar contributed to a temporary negative industrial growth in the second quarter of last year.
Similar macro factors and supply/demand rebalancing in oil markets may present challenges for U.S. refiners in the fall. As a reminder, 6 demand charges represent about 50% of our industrial revenue and to the extent we see volatility in sales from existing large industrial customers, the revenue impact should be small. Beyond the fall, we continue to see new and expanding customer growth for the next few years.
Moving to the longer term view. Slide 10 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook for 2017 through 2019, which is unchanged. I'll reiterate that our current outlook reflects pension discount rate assumptions from earlier in the year, which were 4.75% in 2017, 5% in '18 and 5.25% in '19. As a point of reference, our recent forward test year FRP filing for Entergy Arkansas assumed a 4.25% pension discount rate in 2017. If you looked at the market today, that rate would be closer to 4% or perhaps even lower.
Also, 2017, 2018 and 2019 do not currently include the effects of the Nuclear Sustainability Plan or expected mitigations in rate treatment. As Leo said, investing in the long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to preserve the benefits of nuclear for our stakeholders is an important part of Utility strategy.
We are working to identify the cost mitigations, but to the extent we are not completely successful. By the time we get to 2019, we will have gone through a rate proceeding in each of the affected jurisdictions, and we believe that these prudently incurred costs and expected mitigations should be reflected in rates. As such, our long-term earnings plan, 2019 and beyond, should not be significantly affected by the Nuclear Sustainability Plan. As we committed at Analyst Day, we will provide a full update, including all of these items at EEI later this year.
Slide 11 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook assuming market prices as of the end of the quarter. Our current estimates reflect market prices as of June 30, and as you know, prices have come down a bit since then.
Before I close, I'd like to highlight 2 items. Last week, Moody's Investor Services changed Entergy Mississippi's rating outlook to positive from stable. Moody's specifically noted EMI's successful implementation of its formula rate plan with forward-looking features. Moody's views the FRP as a significant credit positive since it provides a dependable and clear framework for timely operating cost recovery.
Also during the quarter, we completed several refinancings, issuing $840 million of operating company debt at an average coupon of 3.1%. The majority of the issuances were economic refinancings, which replaced about $660 million of debt with an average rate of 6.1%, creating annual interest savings of about $20 million pretax. These interest savings will help offset the effect of the potentially lower-than-planned pension discount rate.
As Leo mentioned, results through the first half of the year have been solid and in line with our growth expectations for our core Utility, Parent & Other business. That said, we still -- we know we still have work to do to achieve our longer-term aspirations, and we will continue to work toward that end.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

If we're unable to reach commercial agreements with Exelon or we're not able to achieve those regulatory approvals, we will begin the regular decommissioning process and stay on the same path that we have previously been on.

I think it is tough to extrapolate from just the last couple of quarters. I mean, clearly, as we've talked about on other calls, as other utilities also, we see the effects of energy efficiency, both at the state level and through different federal guidelines having impacts. And we see our usage per customer starting -- it's been in a decline again, I think, consistent with what we've seen with the industry. We started to see some flattening out relative to that. And I think also you have the macroeconomic impacts from a demand perspective. And I think as we go forward, the macroeconomic impacts clearly would be the first that you would point to in terms of positives as if you could change that. If you look through our region and you look at our gross state product forecast, we see that. We saw kind of a downward trend over the past year or so. We see that starting to pick back up. And clearly if that does materialize, you could see some positive impacts as it relates to that. But we'll continue to see impacts around energy efficiency as we go forward. And as we get further through the year, especially the third quarter because it's one of our largest quarters from a sales perspective, I think we'll have a better perspective and point of view around what we think the longer-term trend will take us."

We mentioned the $6 billion to $8 billion number at that point in time, but that, obviously, goes out beyond the period we're talking here now. Also in the world of gas price volatility, et cetera, where there's nothing in there for anything, we might do the hedge that volatility if it were to include investments and the like and the potential for where we come out on some of the renewable RFPs, et cetera. So when you get to the backend and certainly and beyond it, there is a significant amount of other things that we're investigating, that could be part of the capital program in addition to what we need. And again, as we've mentioned before, we've got a pretty solid generation and transmission capital program. And we're doing that from a position, as we've mentioned before, of being short generation across the system, and we would continue to anticipate that, that we would be short across the system as we go forward and these capital investments create a significant amount of benefits to our customers. And as it relates to reduced congestion, lower production cost, lower emissions, you name it, particularly given the age of our fleet, these things are really, really beneficial to our customers."

And we've been proceeding down that path for the last several years. The only thing that changes from time to time is the methodology we would use. So for example, when we look at New England and something like from I-Yankee [ph], for example, separation came about because prices didn't support the economics of the plant, and we were forced into shutting it down. To the extent that something becomes transactable as part of that separation, certainly, that's a preferable route as it was with Rhode Island State Energy Center when we sold that and if we're successful to be able to sell FitzPatrick. So I'll say this again, it does impact, I would guess, the probability [ph] distribution of prices it might receive. We still believe that we're going to get the plant relicensed, so that would indicate a long life of the plant. And then the other aspect, it was always -- has always been part of transacting, which was part of the spin, was regulatory approvals that we would require to get something done. All those are the same. We've just -- we're incrementally changing the dynamic as we proceed down the relicensing pathway to be successful or if something like this occurs where, again, it changes the downside price risk."

Strong growth in our core business, absent any impact of taxes or weather, was coupled with significant accomplishment. We spent the first half of 2016 working to execute on our strategy, and the results we are reporting today are a reflection of that work. We've made progress towards meeting our objective of steady, predictable growth at the Utility while reducing our EWC footprint. We delivered solid results through the first half of the year.
Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased 35% this quarter versus last year and are in line with our growth expectations for our core business. Most importantly, we continue to set up the business to achieve our longer term targets. Our extensive 2016 to-do list on Slide 3 is a road map of the execution of our strategy, and it's a good way to illustrate some of what we've accomplished.
At the Utility, we received a favorable ALJ recommendation for the St. Charles Power Station. The result of the Entergy Louisiana request for proposal was announced with the self-build alternative and one long-term power purchase agreement selected. The self-build alternative was also selected in the Entergy Texas request for proposal. Entergy New Orleans filed for approval for a new gas-fired combustion turbine. Entergy Mississippi received a revenue increase under its first formula rate plan filing with forward-looking features. Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year formula rate plan filing. Entergy Arkansas made its first forward test year formula rate filing. Entergy Texas received approval on its transmission cost recovery factor rider. We received the confirmatory action letter from the NRC for ANO, and the letter is consistent with our expectation, and we saw over 7% industrial growth versus last year. At EWC, we entered into negotiations for the sale of our FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant. 
Finally, we met with many of you on our Analyst Day in June where we highlighted our progress towards effectively shifting our investment profile to a pure-play Utility. We're achieving this shift by continuing to invest in the Utility for the benefit of our customers while maintaining reasonable rates. One of these investments is the St. Charles Power Station project, which received a favorable recommendation from the administrative law judge in July. We expect the certification decision from the LPSC in August. We're encouraged with the ALJ's recommendation that the project serves the public convenience and necessity and is in the public interest. The ALJ further recommends that Entergy Louisiana's decision to commence construction is prudent, and the selection of the project is consistent with the terms of the LPSC's market-based mechanisms order.
We also continue to make progress for our plans for a CCGT in Texas. In April, the RFP process resulted in the selection of the self-build alternative, and in the third quarter, we will begin the necessary filings for regulatory approval. We are on a similar path in Louisiana where the RFP process also resulted in the selection of the self-build alternative, and we expect to make the necessary regulatory filings in the third quarter. That same RFP resulted in the selection of a long-term power purchase agreement for an existing CCGT resource, and we also plan to seek approval of the PPA from the LPSC.
Entergy New Orleans has filed an application with New Orleans City Council seeking approval to build the New Orleans Power Station, a natural gas-fired combustion turbine plant at the existing Michoud site. This request follows the early June deactivations of our 1960's era Michoud units 2 and 3. These units are a prime example of the aging infrastructure in our service territory. The decision to deactivate these units was based on economics, maintenance and operational considerations. The new plan will provide a long-term local resource that can meet the city's particular resource needs at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. We've requested the city council approve by January -- approval by January 31, 2017. If approved, as requested, the new plan is expected to be placed in service in the second half of 2019.
These investments will provide more cost-effective, reliable and efficient generating resources for our customers. By building these plants, we will reduce the average age of our fleet and improve the heat rate in key areas of our system. For example, by 2025, in the WOTAB region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by approximately 19 years. Also in the Amite South region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by 18 years. And with new units operating at heat rates of less than 7,000, the efficiency of our fossil generation portfolio will be improved by roughly 800 BTUs per kWh fleet-wide by 2025. Additionally, the new CCGT units will, on average, produce 41% fewer carbon dioxide emissions in our Legacy gas units.
In addition to addressing our aging infrastructure, we also need to control fuel volatility in our customers' bills. Our nuclear assets are critical to this objective as they provide valuable fuel diversity to our utility fleet. The low volatility of nuclear fuel price effectively acts as a hedge against the high volatility of natural gas prices. Beyond fuel diversity, our nuclear assets also provide other significant benefits. As large scale virtually emissions-free resources, these assets minimize our environmental footprint, run at high-capacity factors and provide stable baseload generation.
Nuclear generation also offers a host of economic benefits and contributes to the financial health of the communities in which these assets sit, including thousands of good paying jobs, tax benefits to local state and federal governments and billions of dollars in economic output.
Investing in the long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to preserve these benefits for our 4 stakeholders is an important part of our Utility strategy. We've drafted the framework for our nuclear sustainability plan that will preserve these benefits, and that framework is now under external peer review. We're working on firming up the cost estimates and steps for implementation. We are currently on track with our commitment to provide you even more specifics at EEI this November.
We also have a path-forward at Arkansas Nuclear One. The NRC issued its confirmatory action letter shortly after our Analyst Day and adopted our proposed comprehensive recovery plan. The letter confirmed that the planned redeveloped will lead us to sustained performance improvement. We will work diligently to complete the agreed upon actions listed in the letter to the satisfaction of the NRC. We believe we will be able to demonstrate to the NRC our ability to exit Column 4 as early as late 2017. However, our goal is not to simply exit Column 4, but to return to sustained operational excellence and to be considered one of the industry's strongest performers.
We're rounding out our generation portfolio with renewable and energy initiatives I talked about last quarter. Entergy New Orleans' solar generation project with battery storage technology was placed in service in June. Entergy Arkansas' power purchase agreement will support construction. We have an 81-megawatt solar energy generating facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018. Entergy Mississippi's 3 new solar installations are online and capable of generating 500 kWh. And we have 3 renewable requests for proposals outstanding at Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. In the Arkansas and New Orleans RFPs, bidders will have an opportunity to provide acquisition proposals. And the New Orleans proposal also includes a self-build option. Proposals are due in August for the Arkansas and Louisiana RFPs and in October for the New Orleans RFP. Final selections will be made in December of 2016, February of 2017 and April of 2017 for Louisiana, Arkansas and New Orleans, respectively.
In addition to our generation supply plan, we're also executing on our transmission investment plan. In Arkansas, we placed in service a new 23-mile 230 kV line and completed a new 500 kV substation to serve Big River Steel. These 2 projects represent over $100 million of investment. In Mississippi, we completed a new distribution substation and kicked off 2 new projects for another new substation and 115 kV line additions and upgrades. These new projects are expected to be in service in 2017, in total, nearly $75 million of investment. And in Texas, we placed 3 major projects in service between May and July, which totaled roughly $140 million in investment.
These are just a few examples of major transmission projects that facilitate improved system reliability, compliance with NERC standards, enhanced economic development or reduced transmission congestion. And all of these factors can ultimately contribute to a lower cost of service for our customers.
At Analyst Day, we focused on investing in new technology to migrate towards a flexible, reliable and innovative integrated energy network. We're beginning the first phases of this process with advanced meters that change the way we manage our distribution system, reducing operating costs and providing savings for customers.
Since Analyst Day, we finalized our vendor and technology partners and have initiated the design phase of our project. Regulatory filings are expected to begin in September with the first filing to be made before the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Filings in other jurisdictions will follow.
Advanced metering is a foundational technology that supports other technologies to reduce costs and provide customers greater control and options over their energy usage. We've initiated a great engineering study to assess the best path forward, incorporating these technologies in an integrated energy network for each of the operating companies. We will provide more information in due course.
These investments in technology and infrastructure deliver the same benefits as our more traditional investments in generation and transmission, namely a more efficient electric system with enhanced electric reliability and reduced environmental footprint and reduced cost to serve our customers.
Over the past couple of years, we've improved our regulatory constructs to give us the ability to make investments that support economic development, create jobs, improve reliability in our systems and reduce our environmental impact. With many of those constricts now in place, we've moved into a rhythm of filing annual formula rate plans.
Entergy Mississippi received an order approving the revenue increase for its first FRP filing with forward-looking features, and rate adjustments were implemented at the end of June. Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year FRP filing at the end of May. And last month, Entergy Arkansas made its first FRP filing with a forward test year. And at Entergy Texas, we've been working on the implementation of the transmission cost recovery factor. We received approval on this rider in late June, and recovery of transmission spend through this rider will relate back to April 14th.
I'll take a moment now to talk briefly about EWC, starting with an update on Pilgrim, which is currently preparing for its NRC inspection. Many of the same team members who put together the comprehensive recovery plan for ANO are working on a plan for Pilgrim. We expect to be ready for the NRC to conduct its inspection this fall with the confirmatory action letter potentially to be issued in the spring.
And finally, in mid-July, we announced that we are in discussions with Exelon on the sale of our FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant. The opportunity to change the future of FitzPatrick has a significant positive impact on our employees in the surrounding communities, and we're willing to consider any viable options to keeping the plant to open. In that spirit, we applaud The New York PSC's decision to adopt the clean energy standard program. It is a critical component of a potential transaction. We are reviewing the order to confirm it addresses the issues we'd hope, but at this point, we are very encouraged.
As negotiations for sale continue, we continue to proceed along 2 parallel paths, preparing for the plants' permanent shutdown and decommissioning under the current plan, while also preparing for a possible refueling and continued operation in the event of the sale. We are hopeful that negotiations can be completed this month.
Regardless of the outcome, our focus continues to be on the safe and reliable operation of the plant for as long as it continues to operate. We will also do our best to support our employees in the community throughout this transition, whether that leads to a sale to a new owner or the safe shutdown and decommissioning of the plant.
I'd like to thank our hundreds of employees at FitzPatrick who continue to do their best work every day to run the plants safely and reliably amid the uncertainty of the plant's future and the additional burden of preparing for 2 possible paths forward. They continue to show a first-rate level of professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition.
From what I've said so far, you can see that we've accomplished a lot to achieve our objectives, and our employees continue to do so by meeting our obligations to the communities we serve. These communities are home to both our customers and our employees who, along with our owners, represent our 4 key stakeholders. Only by serving all 4 of our stakeholders are we truly successful. In just the last few weeks, we've received recognition from 3 different organizations for our civic minded approach to doing business.
First, I'm proud to say that Entergy Corporation was recently named to the Civic 50, an initiative of Points of Light, honoring the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation. Being named to the Civic 50 acknowledges the number of ways our employees power life for all of our stakeholders. Our team members not only provide reliable and affordable electric power and gas to customers, but also actively support strategic initiatives that support improved educational and employment opportunities, boost economic development and protect the environment.
We've also been awarded the Pro Patria Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, Louisiana Committee, for promoting supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. And finally, our legal department was recently named the recipient of the 2016 Pro Bono Partner Award from the Pro Bono Institute. This national award recognizes innovative team approaches to pro bono work involving in-house legal departments. In a partnership with the Louisiana Civil Justice Center and the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, our lawyers helped to establish and staff the Self Help Resource Center. We are pleased that with the assistance of our law department, the Self Help Resource Center has, to date, been able to serve more than 10,000 vulnerable citizens who otherwise would not have access to legal assistance.
Each of these awards shows that we view our company as part of a broader community. In a recent study conducted by Market Strategies International, Entergy was designated a Most Trusted Brand in 2016, ranking first among electric utilities. Our employees work hard every day to earn the trust of our customers and our broader communities.
I'd also like to acknowledge the nearly 3,200 workers who helped with our recent storm restoration efforts. Severe storms, lighting and high winds left 170,000 customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi without power. Roughly 800 of our own Entergy employees partnered with 2,500 linemen, vegetation workers and support personnel from 15 states. Power was restored to more than 90% of affected customers in less than 3 days. Times like these are when our people truly shine. These and other actions we take every day are the way that we power life.
In summary, this was a very solid quarter. Our financial results with our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other earnings increasing 35% versus last year and our accomplishments towards implementing our investment plan to benefit customers and our continued strategic actions at EWC provide a clear path toward our objectives. Our results for the first half of 2016 have demonstrated our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. And so with our objectives and strategy firmly in place, we'll continue down this path to pursue steady, predictable growth of the Utility, while reducing the EWC footprint. For the second half of 2016, we look forward to continuing to deliver solid results for each of our 4 stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

I'll start with the key takeaways on Slide 4. Quickly pointing to the top right corner for our core business, Utility, Parent & Others adjusted earnings for the quarter came in strong, 35% above last year, and in li",1325,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the key takeaways on Slide 4. Quickly pointing to the top right corner for our core business, Utility, Parent & Others adjusted earnings for the quarter came in strong, 35% above last year, and in line with what we expected. As you may recall, our adjusted view removes special items, weather and tax effects. Our full year view of Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings remained on target with our original guidance. Looking at the bottom left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat after normalizing income taxes.
Turning to the details, beginning on Slide 5. The blue bars show our consolidated operational earnings, which were $3.11 per share in the current period. This compares to $0.83 a year ago. This quarter's results were higher than last year due to a few factors, most significant of which was income taxes, which increased earnings about $2 per share net of customer sharing. While these tax items are beneficial, and we previously discussed their potential, they were not included in our original guidance due to their uncertainty.
In the current period, as-reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close. These special items include a portion of the proceeds we received during the quarter for DOE litigation as we talked about at Analyst Day in June as well as severance and retention costs and capital spending, which were expensed because the plants are impaired.
Operational earnings per share for Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.92 quarter-over-quarter, shown on Slide 6. Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, excluding the effects of weather and income tax items, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.31. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investment that benefits customers and improves returns. Specific drivers include the Union Power Station acquisition and Entergy Arkansas rate case. Also contributing to the earnings increase was non-fuel O&M expense, which declined on lower fossil spending and decreased compensation and benefits expense.
Utility, Parent & Others increase in as-reported income included $0.68 for income taxes, net of approximately $0.06 for additional customer sharing reflected in that revenue.
During the quarter, we resolved result tax matters within the 2010-2011 audit. As a result, we recognized tax items totaling approximately $135 million. Though these tax items come about for other businesses purposes, they are important to us because they provide real benefits. For example, tax sharing has reduced customer bills more than $300 million over the past 14 years.
Turning to EWC's second quarter results, summarized on Slide 7. Operational earnings were $1.34 in the current quarter compared to a slight loss a year ago. A $238 million reduction in income tax expense from a tax election accounted for virtually all of EWC's earnings this quarter. Excluding this item, EWC's earnings would have been $0.01 slightly higher than last year. Effects from 2015 impairments and lower non-fuel O&M expense were largely offset by lower prices and volume for EWC's nuclear fleet.
Slide 8 shows operating cash flow this quarter of $719 million, slightly lower than the same quarter in 2015.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 9. As you can see, we are affirming our original guidance for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $4.20 to $4.50 with expectations still around the middle of the guidance range. As we mentioned at Analyst Day, we've improved incremental nuclear spending for this year, and we expect to mitigate those costs with a number of items across the business. This is reflected in our affirmation of 26 (sic) [ 2016 ] guidance today.
We are also updating our consolidated Entergy operational guidance range of $6.60 to $7.40 with a $7 per share midpoint. This update is due largely to the income tax items recorded in the second quarter. Absent those tax items and consistent with our previous discussions, we would expect to be around the bottom of the original guidance range due primarily to unfavorable weather, the extended outage of Indian Point 2 and lower market prices. To be clear, we do not expect additional significant income taxes for the remainder of this year.
I'll also note that while industrial sales growth has been strong at 6.7% for the first half of the year, we expect this to taper off in the second half of 2016, particularly from our biggest segment, Refiners, as they ran very well in the third and fourth quarters of last year, and they're expected to have a number of maintenance outages this fall. In addition, you may recall that high product inventory levels and a strong dollar contributed to a temporary negative industrial growth in the second quarter of last year.
Similar macro factors and supply/demand rebalancing in oil markets may present challenges for U.S. refiners in the fall. As a reminder, 6 demand charges represent about 50% of our industrial revenue and to the extent we see volatility in sales from existing large industrial customers, the revenue impact should be small. Beyond the fall, we continue to see new and expanding customer growth for the next few years.
Moving to the longer term view. Slide 10 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook for 2017 through 2019, which is unchanged. I'll reiterate that our current outlook reflects pension discount rate assumptions from earlier in the year, which were 4.75% in 2017, 5% in '18 and 5.25% in '19. As a point of reference, our recent forward test year FRP filing for Entergy Arkansas assumed a 4.25% pension discount rate in 2017. If you looked at the market today, that rate would be closer to 4% or perhaps even lower.
Also, 2017, 2018 and 2019 do not currently include the effects of the Nuclear Sustainability Plan or expected mitigations in rate treatment. As Leo said, investing in the long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to preserve the benefits of nuclear for our stakeholders is an important part of Utility strategy.
We are working to identify the cost mitigations, but to the extent we are not completely successful. By the time we get to 2019, we will have gone through a rate proceeding in each of the affected jurisdictions, and we believe that these prudently incurred costs and expected mitigations should be reflected in rates. As such, our long-term earnings plan, 2019 and beyond, should not be significantly affected by the Nuclear Sustainability Plan. As we committed at Analyst Day, we will provide a full update, including all of these items at EEI later this year.
Slide 11 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook assuming market prices as of the end of the quarter. Our current estimates reflect market prices as of June 30, and as you know, prices have come down a bit since then.
Before I close, I'd like to highlight 2 items. Last week, Moody's Investor Services changed Entergy Mississippi's rating outlook to positive from stable. Moody's specifically noted EMI's successful implementation of its formula rate plan with forward-looking features. Moody's views the FRP as a significant credit positive since it provides a dependable and clear framework for timely operating cost recovery.
Also during the quarter, we completed several refinancings, issuing $840 million of operating company debt at an average coupon of 3.1%. The majority of the issuances were economic refinancings, which replaced about $660 million of debt with an average rate of 6.1%, creating annual interest savings of about $20 million pretax. These interest savings will help offset the effect of the potentially lower-than-planned pension discount rate.
As Leo mentioned, results through the first half of the year have been solid and in line with our growth expectations for our core Utility, Parent & Other business. That said, we still -- we know we still have work to do to achieve our longer-term aspirations, and we will continue to work toward that end.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

And there's little bits and pieces here and there that are going to help us out. Insurances is helping us out a little bit this year, and we think it will help us some going forward. There are other O&M areas that we're looking at. Depreciation's been a little bit helpful this year. So I think there's just a number of things that are out there that we're trying to turn over every rock right now to make sure we mitigate as much of the expected headwinds, as you're describing them, as possible. And that's our objective, to make sure that we get to a point in the fall where we can update you and try to maintain those same guidance ranges.

Largely, those are state-driven. In the event that all those regulatory approvals are met, then we would proceed down the path with Exelon, and then the plant would be refueled in January. If we're unable to reach commercial agreements with Exelon or we're not able to achieve those regulatory approvals, we will begin the regular decommissioning process and stay on the same path that we have previously been on. But as Leo pointed out, we are -- there are no plans to continue to run the plant under Entergy ownership as we've made a commitment to reduce the size of the EWC footprint, and that would not be consistent with that strategy."

If you look through our region and you look at our gross state product forecast, we see that. We saw kind of a downward trend over the past year or so. We see that starting to pick back up. And clearly if that does materialize, you could see some positive impacts as it relates to that. But we'll continue to see impacts around energy efficiency as we go forward.

And again, as we've mentioned before, we've got a pretty solid generation and transmission capital program.

And we've been proceeding down that path for the last several years. The only thing that changes from time to time is the methodology we would use. So for example, when we look at New England and something like from I-Yankee [ph], for example, separation came about because prices didn't support the economics of the plant, and we were forced into shutting it down. To the extent that something becomes transactable as part of that separation, certainly, that's a preferable route as it was with Rhode Island State Energy Center when we sold that and if we're successful to be able to sell FitzPatrick. So I'll say this again, it does impact, I would guess, the probability [ph] distribution of prices it might receive. We still believe that we're going to get the plant relicensed, so that would indicate a long life of the plant. And then the other aspect, it was always -- has always been part of transacting, which was part of the spin, was regulatory approvals that we would require to get something done.

Today, we're announcing another solid quarter with operational earnings per share of $2.31. Adjusted earnings of $1.98 for our core Utility, Parent & Other business were substantially higher than last year, and in line with our growth expectations. We remain on track to meet this year's guidance for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share.
As our results show, we continue to execute on our strategy and meet our objectives both at the Utility and EWC. At the beginning of the year, we set out our to do list and shown on Slide 3. And with 3 quarters of 2016 now behind us, I'm happy to say that we've successfully completed most of those tasks.
Each of these accomplishments supports our objective of steady and predictable growth at the Utility, while managing risk and reducing our EWC footprint. At the Utility, we continue to make needed investments which will modernize our system and enhance sufficiency and reliability for the benefit of our customers. We have a number of generation projects in front of us which will meet this purpose.
First, the St. Charles Power Station is a 980-megawatt CCGT to be constructed and placed into service in Montz, Louisiana by June of 2019. The administrative law judge recommended supporting this certification of this project in July, and we're awaiting a final regulatory decision from the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The commission is faced with scheduling challenges, and it has been difficult for the full commission to take up major items for vote. However, we anticipate that the commission will be able to make a decision on this project before the end of the year.
On October 7, Entergy Texas made its filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, seeking the certification to construct the Montgomery County Power Station. This 993-megawatt highly efficient combined cycle plant will provide reliable power at significantly reduced energy costs. The plant will produce an expected $1.7 billion in net benefits to our Texas customers. In addition, the plant will use state-of-the-art emission control technology to lower air emissions. And construction, anticipated to begin in 2019, will provide more than 2,800 direct jobs in Texas and nearly $1 billion in economic activity to the local economy.
In June, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the New Orleans City Council seeking approval to construct the New Orleans Power Station. The 226-megawatt CT will provide a modern cost-effective local resource to enhance reliability and operational flexibility, mitigate market risks and aid in restoration efforts following major weather events. The construction of this plant will produce hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits for the state and local economy. We are currently working with the city council to set a procedural schedule.
And we expect to make filings with the Louisiana commission to begin the regulatory approval process for the Lake Charles CCGT later this year. This also will be a highly efficient plant that will support the growing customer base in the Lake Charles area. Additionally, we estimate the plant will provide around $1.4 billion in savings to customers over its lifetime.
Our transmission grid is equally vital for the operation of our system, and ongoing investments are required for compliance, reliability and efficiency. We continually make upgrades in additions to the grid to enhance our level of service and make room for growth. At the end of June, we completed Phase 2 of our PB Voltage Support project in Arkansas, constructing a new 230 kV substation and transmission line. In July, we also finished the installation of a 230 kV line, a 500 kV-230 kV autotransformer and a 230 kV substation to better serve our customers in Texas.
Some of our transmission investment decisions are made through the annual MISO Transmission Expansion Planning process, also known as MTEP. We are nearing the end of the MTEP planning process for 2016.
Currently, we have 48 projects totaling roughly $480 million under consideration. The MISO board will make its selections and give final approval to projects in December. On September 15, we submitted about $700 million of proposed projects for MTEP '17, and we will work with MISO on the selection process for those proposals over the course of the next year.
For the last several years, we've been executing on these and other traditional generation and transmission projects. We've also begun to outline investments which will lay the foundation for an integrated energy network. To that end, on September 19, Entergy Arkansas was the first of our jurisdictions to make regulatory filings seeking approval for its commission for advanced metering implementation.
These were followed by filings from Entergy New Orleans on October 18. In each filing, we've requested that our regulators find the deployment of the advanced metering infrastructure to be in the public interests. Entergy Arkansas expects to recover its investment through its forward-looking FRP. Entergy New Orleans has requested approval to implement a phase-in customer charge. Deployment of this infrastructure, including advanced meters, is expected to bring total net benefits of approximately $260 million to our customers in Arkansas and New Orleans, in addition to improved outage restoration, enhanced customer service and tools to better manage energy usage.
Contingent on approval by the Arkansas Commission and the New Orleans City Council, meter deployment will begin in 2019. Ahead of meter deployment, we are focused on constructing and integrating the back-office systems that support this technology and make it smart, a meter data management system, a new outage management system and distribution management system as well as designing and installing the infrastructure for our communications network. Advanced meters are a big step forward, and the advantages they provide to our customers as well as the follow-on technologies and services they enable represent the future of our company and our industry.
I'd like to take a moment now to extend our sympathy to the family and friends of Clyde Holloway, the Louisiana Public Service Commission chair who recently passed away. Commissioner Holloway was consistently fair, dedicated to serving the public interest and treated his convictions. We appreciate his many years of public service.
Last Friday, the Governor of Louisiana appointed Charlie DeWitt, Former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, to fill the remaining months of Commissioner Holloway's term. We look forward to working with Commissioner DeWitt. As you know, we spent the last few years working with our regulators, Commissioner Holloway and others, for improvements in our regulatory constructs. These constructs are now facilitating our investments in the utility infrastructure.
For example, this quarter, Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement in its first FRP filing with a forward test year. We have requested any potential rate adjustments to be in effect on December 30. Entergy Mississippi completed its FRP filing with a stipulated settlement for a $19.4 million rate increase. Newer rates were effective in July 2016. Entergy Texas filed for a $19 million annual increase to its transmission cost recovery factor rider in September, reflecting $210 million of incremental transmission investment since its last base rate filing.
Entergy Texas also presented its view on alternative ratemaking mechanisms to the Public Utility Commission in Texas through a filing made in August. This filing was a response to the Texas Legislature's request for the commission to conduct a study and make recommendations regarding appropriate reforms to the ratemaking process. With its comments, Entergy Texas asserted that a formulary plan in the forward test year as an effective mechanism to reduce regulatory lags. This mechanism would provide utilities with an opportunity to earn their authorized returns and is also beneficial to utility's credit ratings providing access to capital at lower cost to customers, and facilitating infrastructure investment to support economic development and the creation of jobs in Texas.
The commission will consider the filing along with the recommendations from others and provide its final ratemaking report to the Legislature in January.
And our FERC-regulated system agreement came to an end on September 1 after more than 50 years of existence. This agreement has been a source of litigation between Entergy and various retail regulators for years, and its elimination moves that risk and -- removes that risk and allows us to focus more specifically on the priorities and policies of the local regulators. You've also heard us talk about the importance of controlling bills for our customers. Our rates continue to be among the lowest in the country, and these low rates are one of the factors that make our region attractive for industrial development. We said there are a number of levers available to keep overall customer bills reasonable. In one such example, last month, $55 million of Mississippi storm restoration bonds for Hurricane Katrina were fully paid off, and we were able to remove that charge from our customers' bills. These are the first storm securitization bonds to roll off bills and more will follow for our customers in Louisiana in 2018, in Texas in 2021.
Shifting to our nuclear operations. We've recognized the importance of nuclear powers as part of the national energy landscape and the significant benefits our plants bring to our stakeholders. Nuclear power is a source of low-cost steady reliable baseload power. It provides fuel diversity to our generation portfolio and reduces geo price volatility. It minimizes our environmental footprint by creating virtually no emissions. Each plant anchors its surrounding community with steady good-paying jobs, a significant property tax base and other ancillary economic benefits. And last but not least, we believe the plants are necessary to ensure the continued reliability of our electric grid.
We must preserve the benefits our plants provide and ensure that our operations are in line with evolving nuclear industry standards for operational excellence. This requires that we look at what investment is needed to ensure safe and reliable operations in the near term as well as what it will take to prepare plants to operate at [ph] the end of their expected operating lives.
As a result, going forward, the cost to operate our plants will be higher. Good [ph] investing to preserve these valuable resources for our customers, communities, employees and owners is an important part of our utility strategy. Our financial plan now includes the investments we believe are needed to meet our goals for nuclear operations as well as mitigating actions and rate treatment [ph]. Drew will discuss our revised earnings outlook and other outlook information in his remarks.
Turning briefly to EWC. Operational earnings for the quarter were essentially flat for the same quarter of last year. Like many merchant generators, we face market challenges, including very low commodity prices. Each challenges are apparent and revised EWC EBITDA outlooks we've provided today and further validate the progress we continue to make on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint. 
On August 9, we announced our agreement to sell the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon. We recently received early termination of the HSR waiting period, and we continue to work through the required regulatory approvals with the NRC, FERC and the New York Public Service Commission. We are targeting the second quarter of 2017 to close the transaction. We also continue to pursue the long 2 parallel paths, both the plant's refueling and potential sale, and the possibility of permanent shutdown and decommissioning. Once again, I'd like to thank our FitzPatrick employees who continue to operate the plant safely and reliably throughout this transition. 
We're also entering into agreements this quarter to sell our EWC wind assets in Iowa and Texas, and expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to be disciplined in our assessment of every remaining asset in our EWC portfolio to execute on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint.
Many of you have heard about the mid-August rainstorms in South Louisiana, which brought devastation to so many of our customers as well as our employees. These historic rains dropped an estimated 7 trillion gallons of water in 1 week, damaging roughly 60,000 homes and businesses, and causing outages to more than 32,000 of our electric customers. Our crews worked tirelessly to restore power quickly and safely to customers. After the water receded, hundreds of Entergy employees from 4 states, friends and family members, all logged over 10,000 hours of volunteer service, helping to clean flooded homes. In addition, they collected needed tools and supplies, and provided meals to those in the area, coming together admirably to support each other and the affected community. To that end, Entergy contributed $525,000 to local nonprofit organizations to help them respond to the storm.
I'd also like to acknowledge those who were recently affected and suffered losses in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. Along with many of our peer utilities, Entergy provided over 400 workers to assist in restoration efforts. We were eager to respond to this call for help as others have done for us many times in the past. In many ways, events such as these are an important reminder of who we serve and what we do best. Supporting the communities where our customers and employees live has always been a part of who we are at Entergy and one of the many ways we power life. In recognition of effort such as these as well as our other sustainable business practices, Entergy has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 15th consecutive year. We earned top scores in the areas of corporate citizenship and philanthropy, climate strategy, biodiversity and water-related risks. The index confirms that we are focused on the right things and successfully providing value to each of our core stakeholders. Site Selection Magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top 10 utilities and economic development in 2015. This is the ninth year in a row that we've been named to the list, recognizing our integral role that resulted in nearly $10 billion of capital investment and the creation of over 4,800 jobs in our service territory. We know that economic development is important for our customers across the region and it's also good for business. We will continue to record our state agencies and local communities to promote growth across our service territory.
In summary, this was another solid quarter. Both our consolidated operational earnings and our adjusted earnings for our core business were substantially higher than last year and in line with our growth expectations. Our solid results to date demonstrate our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. With that backdrop, I'll also note that our financial outlook now reflect our prudent decision to position the nuclear fleet for sustained operational excellence along with other nonfuel such as increased such as increased benefit expenses due to the prolonged low-interest environment and industrywide of flattening consumption for residential and commercial customers. 
Despite the near-term effects and corporation of these items in our financial outlooks strengthens our confidence and our ability to deliver on our long-term goal as reflected in our unchanged 2019 outlook. As we look down the road to 2019 and beyond, we continue to see the benefits of the progress and accomplishments we've made over the past 24 months to execute on our objectives of steady predictable growth on utility and other earnings and corporate dividends. We look forward to talking with you some more about our plans and our outlook at EEI next month. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to drew."

In addition to reviewing the quarterly results, I'll take some time today to talk about our longer-term outlook. We know that you are all anticipating an update on our nuclear investments and its financial effects, we decided to give you key information advance of EEI to help better prepare for those meetings.
I'll start with key the takeaways from our third quarter results on Slide 4. Beginning with the consolidated results in the top left corner. As reported earnings included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close or sell. Results included significant impairments for the FitzPatrick and plants. On an operational view, our consolidated earnings were $2.31 per share in the current period as compares to $1.90 a year ago. The increase is due to growth in our core Utility, Parent & Other business shown in the top right corner. Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased more than 25% above last year which I'll discuss shortly. Just a reminder, our adjusted view normalizes for special items, the estimated effects of weather and income taxes. Looking at the bottom left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat.
Operational earnings per share of Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.40 quarter-over-quarter, shown on Slide 5. Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.42. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investments that benefit customers and improve returns. Specific drivers include Entergy Arkansas' rate case, the Union Power Station acquisition, Entergy Mississippi's recent formulary rate plan and Entergy Texas' new transmission cost recovery rider.
Build retail sales for the quarter were lower than a year ago. We continue to see weakness in both residential and commercial sales. Industrial sales were also lower even considering the continued growth from new and expansion customers. This is consistent with our comments last quarter. Despite the lower sales volume, industrial revenue was up, excluding rate effects because of the demand of the bill and the new customers. For the full year, we anticipate industrial growth to be in line with our original guidance assumption of approximately 2.9% and we expect industrial growth to continue into next year at around the same level. 
Also contributing to the UPO earnings increase, with nonfuel O&M which declined, lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses were the largest driver. 
Turning to EWC's third quarter results, summarized on Slide 6, operational earnings were $0.19 in the current quarter as compared to $0.18 a year ago. FX from 2015 impairments were partly offset by lower energy prices. Decommissioning expense is also higher due to the establishment of decommissioning liabilities for Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick as a result of our agreement with NYPA to transfer decommissioning trough and liabilities to Entergy. 
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow, which once again around $1 billion consistent with the same quarter last year.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 8. As you can see, we are affirming our 2016 guidance, consolidated operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. For the consolidated operational view, positive weather in the third quarter is being more than offset by lower EWC revenue and higher decommissioning expense for the first transfer transaction. We also expect a slightly higher FX tax rate. Overall, we currently expect consolidated operational results will be within the bottom half of the range.
For Utility, Parent & Other, we still expect adjusted earnings for the year at around the midpoint of our guidance range. That said, there are a few things that we're keeping an eye on. As you know, we have the water steam generator replacement project before the Louisiana Commission, that issue is not yet fully resolved. Grand Gulf is also in an extended outage and we will continue to monitor this applications. On the positive side, we recognize that our nonfuel O&M is favorable to our plant through the third quarter. We will continue to monitor our spending for opportunities in the fourth quarter.
In just under 2 weeks for the EEI, we will discuss our strategy and longer-term views. However, I'd like to take a minute to talk about our financial outlooks, starting with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on Slide 9. At Analyst Day, we knew that we would have significant incremental spending to ensure the longer-term sustainability of our nuclear plants. Since then, we have spent the last few months going through the process that Chris outlined to help us understand the magnitude of the investment needed to position our fleet for sustained operational excellence. The low interest rate environment and its effect on our pension and postretirement benefit expenses was also discussed at the Analyst Day.
More recently, residential and commercial sales have been lower than our expectations and we now expect a lower growth rate. Our goal is to fully mitigate these effects by identifying opportunities to operate our business more efficiently, reprioritizing projects along the business function and utilizing regulatory mechanisms available to us as needed. Considering all of these, we now expect our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings to be lower in 2017 and 2018. However, we are still on track for greater than 5% 3-year growth based on the midpoint of our adjusted 2019 outlook versus our 2016 guidance.
Slide 10 illustrates the major changes from our original Utility, Parent & Other outlook to our current expectations. The primary drivers for our changes are: the aforementioned higher nuclear cost, lower pension discount rate and lower retail sales. These are expected to be about $0.75 in 2017. Partially offset by mitigations we've identified in the past several months, which total about $0.25 in 2017, and increased net revenue from rate actions and other items which will help about $0.20 next year.
Regarding mitigations, we've worked hard over the past several months to identify opportunities. For example, on the last call, we talked about interest expense reductions from economic refinancings. We've also issued new debt at rates lower than we planned. In addition, we've identified O&M savings from various employee initiatives for the company, driving improvements in sourcing, benefits, issued outage operational and other costs over the next few years. Our outlook now reflects recovery of our driven spending, net of mitigations to our normal ratemaking mechanisms.
On Slide 11, EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA outlook also reflects lower expectations. The summary of what's changed is provided on Slide 12. Like Utility, Parent & Other, net revenue and nonfuel O&M are the 2 key drivers for the changes at EWC. Revenue estimates declined due to lower prices and reduce volume for revised assumptions on outages, including at Indian Point more conservatively planned additional time for potential replacement of baffle volts.
As noted on Slide 13, we will have additional details at the EEI Financial Conference, where we will continue the discussion of our business strategy, including our new peer investments, longer-term outlooks and 2017 drivers. As has been our practice, we anticipate that we will provide earnings guidance for 2017 and our detailed 3-year capital plan on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
We realize that we've covered a lot in the information today. We've also included some information on our nuclear investments in our preliminary 3-year capital plan in the appendix of our webcast presentation. We'll be listening to your questions today and over the next week, and we'll provide information that you need to understand and analyze these changes at EEI.

It's something that we spend a lot of time trying to maintain. As you know, we already have some of the lowest rates in the country, 20% to 25% below the national average. And as far as the expenditures go, if they weren't prudent, we wouldn't make them. Between our mitigation actions as well as other items that are rolling off like securitizations that I mentioned in the seeping $55 million in 2018, we have roughly $1 billion of securitization bonds rolling out at the Louisiana jurisdictions and that and utilizing our normal regulatory processes. We do believe that all the prudently incurred expenditures will be recovered. And also keep in mind here that when we look at the jurisdictions that are most impacted by the nuclear spend, namely obviously, Arkansas and Louisiana, where the plants reside, you put everything together not just the spend that we've got in addition here but everything and over the net -- over the period that we're talking about, we wouldn't expect the customer rates to increase by much more than 1%, including everything so far less than the rate of inflation annually. And so the impact here we're trying to manage as much as we can, all of the expenditures will be prudently incurred. We're putting all of our operations in line with what the industry is. As you know, every plant in the country is different but that's certainly something that we've kept in mind. We've outlined this plan in terms of amount, in terms of timing, in terms of what we need to do to balance the equation not only for the operational side of things but for our customers. And again, we would envision we come out of the back side of this by the time we get into 2019, we'd still have some of the most competitive rates in the country."

There are other technologies that we will deploy on the system then that we're looking at today in terms of asset-management technologies and other things that will go from that point and forward that will provide even greater benefits, savings and helping us to management for our customers and provide that EBIT investment, they will provide us and his opportunity with the same point in time it'll help customers manage their bills through the ability to manage how much they use, when they use it, et cetera. So that, for us, is again, total offense and extremely, extremely exciting for us as we look to the future. When we look at EWC, our objective has not changed. It's always been to separate that business from the utility. And we continue to execute on that, we sold the wind assets  or in the process of selling those. We sold the rice plant last year. We made the decision unfortunate as they are to shut down -- told them to shutdown Vermont Yankee, and we're going to continue on that path, albeit with a different price deck that we see continues to erode but we're still working as diligent as we can. And I think the proof of that is our discipline around first, making the decision at FitzPatrick to seize operations there but at the same time, never giving up and never wavering from the idea that we might come up with something better that resulted in the creation of working with Exelon in the states, come up with the sales of the plant, the continuation of its economic benefit and its reliability benefit for the state of New York and serve our employees and the community. That for us isn't a defense at all. It's all offense. Like everyone else, we're in the merchant market and gas prices have been low particularly in the Northeast and we've got to manage around that but it doesn't change what we're doing or how hard we're working and what we think we can accomplish there and we've accomplished a lot. And we would anticipate over the course of the next couple of years, we'll continue to accomplish a lot. So all that said, we're pretty excited about what we have the opportunity to accomplish here. And again, just going through all that we just talked about with the sustainability of the nuclear fleet, the investment in AMI, the investment in generations business, investment in transmission going through the normal regulatory constructs that we have today and still maintaining our 2019 outlook, sounds like offense to me. But strategically, that's where we're headed, the same place we were headed before and we just updated some of the information for you, that's all."

Today, we're announcing another solid quarter with operational earnings per share of $2.31. Adjusted earnings of $1.98 for our core Utility, Parent & Other business were substantially higher than last year, and in line with our growth expectations. We remain on track to meet this year's guidance for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share.
As our results show, we continue to execute on our strategy and meet our objectives both at the Utility and EWC. At the beginning of the year, we set out our to do list and shown on Slide 3. And with 3 quarters of 2016 now behind us, I'm happy to say that we've successfully completed most of those tasks.
Each of these accomplishments supports our objective of steady and predictable growth at the Utility, while managing risk and reducing our EWC footprint. At the Utility, we continue to make needed investments which will modernize our system and enhance sufficiency and reliability for the benefit of our customers. We have a number of generation projects in front of us which will meet this purpose.
First, the St. Charles Power Station is a 980-megawatt CCGT to be constructed and placed into service in Montz, Louisiana by June of 2019. The administrative law judge recommended supporting this certification of this project in July, and we're awaiting a final regulatory decision from the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The commission is faced with scheduling challenges, and it has been difficult for the full commission to take up major items for vote. However, we anticipate that the commission will be able to make a decision on this project before the end of the year.
On October 7, Entergy Texas made its filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, seeking the certification to construct the Montgomery County Power Station. This 993-megawatt highly efficient combined cycle plant will provide reliable power at significantly reduced energy costs. The plant will produce an expected $1.7 billion in net benefits to our Texas customers. In addition, the plant will use state-of-the-art emission control technology to lower air emissions. And construction, anticipated to begin in 2019, will provide more than 2,800 direct jobs in Texas and nearly $1 billion in economic activity to the local economy.
In June, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the New Orleans City Council seeking approval to construct the New Orleans Power Station. The 226-megawatt CT will provide a modern cost-effective local resource to enhance reliability and operational flexibility, mitigate market risks and aid in restoration efforts following major weather events. The construction of this plant will produce hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits for the state and local economy. We are currently working with the city council to set a procedural schedule.
And we expect to make filings with the Louisiana commission to begin the regulatory approval process for the Lake Charles CCGT later this year. This also will be a highly efficient plant that will support the growing customer base in the Lake Charles area. Additionally, we estimate the plant will provide around $1.4 billion in savings to customers over its lifetime.
Our transmission grid is equally vital for the operation of our system, and ongoing investments are required for compliance, reliability and efficiency. We continually make upgrades in additions to the grid to enhance our level of service and make room for growth. At the end of June, we completed Phase 2 of our PB Voltage Support project in Arkansas, constructing a new 230 kV substation and transmission line. In July, we also finished the installation of a 230 kV line, a 500 kV-230 kV autotransformer and a 230 kV substation to better serve our customers in Texas.
Some of our transmission investment decisions are made through the annual MISO Transmission Expansion Planning process, also known as MTEP. We are nearing the end of the MTEP planning process for 2016.
Currently, we have 48 projects totaling roughly $480 million under consideration. The MISO board will make its selections and give final approval to projects in December. On September 15, we submitted about $700 million of proposed projects for MTEP '17, and we will work with MISO on the selection process for those proposals over the course of the next year.
For the last several years, we've been executing on these and other traditional generation and transmission projects. We've also begun to outline investments which will lay the foundation for an integrated energy network. To that end, on September 19, Entergy Arkansas was the first of our jurisdictions to make regulatory filings seeking approval for its commission for advanced metering implementation.
These were followed by filings from Entergy New Orleans on October 18. In each filing, we've requested that our regulators find the deployment of the advanced metering infrastructure to be in the public interests. Entergy Arkansas expects to recover its investment through its forward-looking FRP. Entergy New Orleans has requested approval to implement a phase-in customer charge. Deployment of this infrastructure, including advanced meters, is expected to bring total net benefits of approximately $260 million to our customers in Arkansas and New Orleans, in addition to improved outage restoration, enhanced customer service and tools to better manage energy usage.
Contingent on approval by the Arkansas Commission and the New Orleans City Council, meter deployment will begin in 2019. Ahead of meter deployment, we are focused on constructing and integrating the back-office systems that support this technology and make it smart, a meter data management system, a new outage management system and distribution management system as well as designing and installing the infrastructure for our communications network. Advanced meters are a big step forward, and the advantages they provide to our customers as well as the follow-on technologies and services they enable represent the future of our company and our industry.
I'd like to take a moment now to extend our sympathy to the family and friends of Clyde Holloway, the Louisiana Public Service Commission chair who recently passed away. Commissioner Holloway was consistently fair, dedicated to serving the public interest and treated his convictions. We appreciate his many years of public service.
Last Friday, the Governor of Louisiana appointed Charlie DeWitt, Former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, to fill the remaining months of Commissioner Holloway's term. We look forward to working with Commissioner DeWitt. As you know, we spent the last few years working with our regulators, Commissioner Holloway and others, for improvements in our regulatory constructs. These constructs are now facilitating our investments in the utility infrastructure.
For example, this quarter, Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement in its first FRP filing with a forward test year. We have requested any potential rate adjustments to be in effect on December 30. Entergy Mississippi completed its FRP filing with a stipulated settlement for a $19.4 million rate increase. Newer rates were effective in July 2016. Entergy Texas filed for a $19 million annual increase to its transmission cost recovery factor rider in September, reflecting $210 million of incremental transmission investment since its last base rate filing.
Entergy Texas also presented its view on alternative ratemaking mechanisms to the Public Utility Commission in Texas through a filing made in August. This filing was a response to the Texas Legislature's request for the commission to conduct a study and make recommendations regarding appropriate reforms to the ratemaking process. With its comments, Entergy Texas asserted that a formulary plan in the forward test year as an effective mechanism to reduce regulatory lags. This mechanism would provide utilities with an opportunity to earn their authorized returns and is also beneficial to utility's credit ratings providing access to capital at lower cost to customers, and facilitating infrastructure investment to support economic development and the creation of jobs in Texas.
The commission will consider the filing along with the recommendations from others and provide its final ratemaking report to the Legislature in January.
And our FERC-regulated system agreement came to an end on September 1 after more than 50 years of existence. This agreement has been a source of litigation between Entergy and various retail regulators for years, and its elimination moves that risk and -- removes that risk and allows us to focus more specifically on the priorities and policies of the local regulators. You've also heard us talk about the importance of controlling bills for our customers. Our rates continue to be among the lowest in the country, and these low rates are one of the factors that make our region attractive for industrial development. We said there are a number of levers available to keep overall customer bills reasonable. In one such example, last month, $55 million of Mississippi storm restoration bonds for Hurricane Katrina were fully paid off, and we were able to remove that charge from our customers' bills. These are the first storm securitization bonds to roll off bills and more will follow for our customers in Louisiana in 2018, in Texas in 2021.
Shifting to our nuclear operations. We've recognized the importance of nuclear powers as part of the national energy landscape and the significant benefits our plants bring to our stakeholders. Nuclear power is a source of low-cost steady reliable baseload power. It provides fuel diversity to our generation portfolio and reduces geo price volatility. It minimizes our environmental footprint by creating virtually no emissions. Each plant anchors its surrounding community with steady good-paying jobs, a significant property tax base and other ancillary economic benefits. And last but not least, we believe the plants are necessary to ensure the continued reliability of our electric grid.
We must preserve the benefits our plants provide and ensure that our operations are in line with evolving nuclear industry standards for operational excellence. This requires that we look at what investment is needed to ensure safe and reliable operations in the near term as well as what it will take to prepare plants to operate at the end of their expected operating lives.
As a result, going forward, the cost to operate our plants will be higher including investing to preserve these valuable resources for our customers, communities, employees and owners is an important part of our utility strategy. Our financial plan now includes the investments we believe are needed to meet our goals for nuclear operations as well as mitigating actions and rate treatment. Drew will discuss our revised earnings outlook and other outlook information in his remarks.
Turning briefly to EWC. Operational earnings for the quarter were essentially flat for the same quarter of last year. Like many merchant generators, we face market challenges, including very low commodity prices. Each challenges are apparent and revised EWC EBITDA outlooks we've provided today and further validate the progress we continue to make on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint. 
On August 9, we announced our agreement to sell the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon. We recently received early termination of the HSR waiting period, and we continue to work through the required regulatory approvals with the NRC, FERC and the New York Public Service Commission. We are targeting the second quarter of 2017 to close the transaction. We also continue to pursue the long 2 parallel paths, both the plant's refueling and potential sale, and the possibility of permanent shutdown and decommissioning. Once again, I'd like to thank our FitzPatrick employees who continue to operate the plant safely and reliably throughout this transition. 
We're also entering into agreements this quarter to sell our EWC wind assets in Iowa and Texas, and expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to be disciplined in our assessment of every remaining asset in our EWC portfolio to execute on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint.
Many of you have heard about the mid-August rainstorms in South Louisiana, which brought devastation to so many of our customers as well as our employees. These historic rains dropped an estimated 7 trillion gallons of water in 1 week, damaging roughly 60,000 homes and businesses, and causing outages to more than 32,000 of our electric customers. Our crews worked tirelessly to restore power quickly and safely to customers. After the water receded, hundreds of Entergy employees from 4 states, friends and family members, all logged over 10,000 hours of volunteer service, helping to clean flooded homes. In addition, they collected needed tools and supplies, and provided meals to those in the area, coming together admirably to support each other and the affected community. To that end, Entergy contributed $525,000 to local nonprofit organizations to help them respond to the storm.
I'd also like to acknowledge those who were recently affected and suffered losses in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. Along with many of our peer utilities, Entergy provided over 400 workers to assist in restoration efforts. We were eager to respond to this call for help as others have done for us many times in the past. In many ways, events such as these are an important reminder of who we serve and what we do best. Supporting the communities where our customers and employees live has always been a part of who we are at Entergy and one of the many ways we power life. 
In recognition of effort such as these as well as our other sustainable business practices, Entergy has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 15th consecutive year. We earned top scores in the areas of corporate citizenship and philanthropy, climate strategy, biodiversity and water-related risks. The index confirms that we are focused on the right things and successfully providing value to each of our core stakeholders. Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top 10 utilities in economic development in 2015. This is the ninth year in a row that we've been named to the list, recognizing our integral role that resulted in nearly $10 billion of capital investment and the creation of over 4,800 jobs in our service territory. We know that economic development is important for our customers across the region and it's also good for business. We will continue to work with our state agencies and local communities to promote growth across our service territory.
In summary, this was another solid quarter. Both our consolidated operational earnings and our adjusted earnings for our core business were substantially higher than last year and in line with our growth expectations. Our solid results to date demonstrate our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. With that backdrop, I'll also note that our financial outlooks now reflect our prudent decision to position the nuclear fleet for sustained operational excellence along with other nonfuel O&M adjustments such as increased benefit expenses due to the prolonged low interest rate environment and the industry-wide of flattening consumption from residential and commercial customers. 
Despite the near-term effects, the incorporation of these items in our financial outlooks strengthens our confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term goals as reflected in our unchanged 2019 outlook. As we look down the road to 2019 and beyond, we continue to see the benefits of the progress and accomplishments we've made over the past 24 months to execute on our objectives of steady predictable growth on Utility, Parent & Other earnings and corporate dividends. We look forward to talking with you some more about our plans and our outlooks at EEI next month. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

In addition to reviewing the quarterly results, I'll take some time today to talk about our longer-term outlook. We know that you are all anticipating an update on our nuclear investments and its financial effects, we decided to give you key information advance at EEI to help you better prepare for those meetings.
I'll start with key takeaways from our third quarter results on Slide 4, beginning with the consolidated results in the top left corner. As reported earnings included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close or sell. Last year's results included significant impairments for the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants. 
On an operational view, our consolidated earnings were $2.31 per share in the current period. This compares to $1.90 a share a year ago. The increase is due to growth in our core Utility, Parent & Other business shown in the top right corner. Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased more than 25% above last year, which I'll discuss shortly. Just a reminder, in our adjusted view, normalizes for special items, the estimated effects of weather and income taxes. Looking at the bottom left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat.
Operational earnings per share of Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.40 quarter-over-quarter, shown on Slide 5. Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.42. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investments that benefit customers and improve returns. Specific drivers include Entergy Arkansas' rate case, the Union Power Station acquisition, Entergy Mississippi's recent formulary rate plan and Entergy Texas' new transmission cost recovery rider.
Billed retail sales for the quarter were lower than a year ago. We continue to see weakness in both residential and commercial sales. Industrial sales were also lower even considering the continued growth from new and expansion customers. This is consistent with our comments last quarter. Despite the lower sales volume, industrial revenue was up, excluding rate effects because of the demand commanded for the bill and the new customers. For the full year, we anticipate industrial growth to be in line with our original guidance assumption of approximately 2.9%, and we expect industrial growth to continue into next year at around the same level. 
Also contributing to the UPO earnings increase was nonfuel O&M, which declined. Lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses were the largest driver. 
Turning to EWC's third quarter results, summarized on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.19 in the current quarter as compared to $0.18 a year ago. Effects from 2015 impairments were partly offset by lower energy prices. Decommissioning expense was also higher due to the establishment of decommissioning liabilities for Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick as a result of our agreement with NYPA to transfer the decommissioning trust and liabilities to Entergy. 
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow, which once again around $1 billion consistent with the same quarter last year.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 8. As you can see, we are affirming our 2016 guidance for consolidated operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. For the consolidated operational view, positive weather in the third quarter is being more than offset by lower EWC revenue and higher decommissioning expense for the NYPA trust transfer transaction. We also expect a slightly higher effective tax rate. Overall, we currently expect consolidated operational results will be within the bottom half of the range.
For Utility, Parent & Other, we still expect adjusted earnings for the year at around the midpoint of our guidance range. That said, there are a few things that we're keeping an eye on. As you know, we have the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project before the Louisiana Commission, and that issue is not yet fully resolved. Grand Gulf is also in an extended outage, and we will continue to monitor these potential implications. On the positive side, we recognized that our nonfuel O&M is favorable to our plant through the third quarter. We will continue to monitor our spending for opportunities in the fourth quarter.
In just under 2 weeks at EEI, we will discuss our strategy and longer-term views. However, I'd like to take a minute to talk about our financial outlooks, starting with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on Slide 9. At Analyst Day, we knew that we would have significant incremental spending to ensure the longer-term sustainability of our nuclear plants. Since then, we have spent the last few months going through the process that Chris Bakken outlined to help us understand the magnitude of the investment needed to position our fleet for sustained operational excellence. The low interest rate environment and its effect on our pension and postretirement benefit expenses was also discussed at the Analyst Day.
More recently, residential and commercial sales have been lower than our expectations, and we now expect a lower growth rate. Our goal is to fully mitigate these effects by identifying opportunities to operate our business more efficiently, reprioritizing projects among the business functions and utilizing regulatory mechanisms available to us as needed. Considering all of these, we now expect our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings to be lower in 2017 and 2018. However, we are still on track for greater than 5% 3-year growth based on the midpoints of our adjusted 2019 outlook versus our 2016 guidance.
Slide 10 illustrates the major changes from our original Utility, Parent & Other outlook to our current expectations. The primary drivers for our changes are: the aforementioned higher nuclear cost, lower pension discount rate and lower retail sales. These are expected to be about $0.75 in 2017, partially offset by mitigations we've identified over the past several months, which total about $0.25 in 2017, and increased net revenue from rate actions and other items which will help about $0.20 next year.
Regarding mitigations, we've worked hard over the past several months to identify opportunities. For example, on the last call, we talked about interest expense reductions from economic refinancings. We've also issued new debt at rates lower than we planned. In addition, we've identified O&M savings from various employee-led initiatives throughout the company, driving improvements in sourcing, benefits, insurance, outage operational and other costs over the next few years. Our outlook now reflects recovery of our prudent spending, net of mitigations through our normal ratemaking mechanisms.
On Slide 11, EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA outlook also reflects lower expectations. The summary of what's changed is provided on Slide 12. Like Utility, Parent & Other, net revenue and nonfuel O&M are the 2 key drivers for the changes at EWC. Revenue estimates declined due to lower forward prices and reduced volume from revised assumptions on outages, including at Indian Point to more conservatively planned additional time for potential replacement of baffle bolts.
As noted on Slide 13, we will have additional details at the EEI Financial Conference, where we will continue the discussion of our business strategy, including our nuclear investments, longer-term outlooks and 2017 drivers. As has been our practice, we anticipate that we will provide earnings guidance for 2017 and our detailed 3-year capital plan on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
We realize that we've covered a lot of new information today. We've also included some information on our nuclear investments in our preliminary 3-year capital plan in the appendix of our webcast presentation. We'll be listening to your questions today and over the next week, and we'll provide information that you need to understand and analyze these changes at EEI. 
We look forward to moving ahead with the strategies to create value for our owners, our customers, our employees and the communities we serve. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

It's something that we spend a lot of time trying to maintain. As you know, we already have some of the lowest rates in the country, 20% to 25% below the national average. And as far as these expenditures go, if they weren't prudent measures to make, we wouldn't make them. Between our mitigation actions as well as other items that are rolling off like securitizations that I mentioned in the seeping $55 million in 2018, we have roughly $1 billion of securitization bonds rolling out at the Louisiana jurisdictions just in that -- in utilizing our normal regulatory processes. We do believe that all the prudently incurred expenditures will be recovered. And also keep in mind here that when we look at the jurisdictions that are most impacted by the nuclear spend, namely, obviously, Arkansas and Louisiana, where the plants reside, you put everything together not just the spend that we've got, the tradition here but everything, and over the net -- over the period that we're talking about, we wouldn't expect the customer rates to increase by much more than 1%, including everything so far less than the rate of inflation annually. And so the impact here we're trying to manage as much as we can, all of the expenditures will be prudently incurred. We're putting all of our operations in line with what the industry is. As you know, every plant in the country is different, but that's certainly something that we've kept in mind. We've outlined this plan in terms of amount, in terms of timing, in terms of what we need to do to balance the equation not only for the operational side of things but for our customers. And again, we would envision we come out of the back side of this by the time we get to 2019, we'd still have some of the most competitive rates in the country."

So we were -- which is slightly above our target range, and our target range is 18% to 20%. And we were talking about a forecast that got us around the neighborhood of 21% that we were working on, obviously, just add, as I said, maybe another 150 basis points to that.

And so we're thinking about other options around how do we manage it, starting with the business itself and can we continue to find ways to be more efficient."

And again, from an -- you asked about the trajectory. And if you look at the plan as we've laid it out now and not just that spend but everything together in those jurisdictions, we're talking about a trajectory of about that we wouldn't expect to be more than 1% a year from a rate standpoint. And remember, it's not only our mitigation -- mitigating actions that Drew outlined that are on the slides in your deck, things like the securitizations blowing off the low growth that we have, the continuation of the investments that we're making, as I outlined all those investments related to the new power plants, et cetera.

I know when we talked about this, initially, we've talked about on a system basis, the investment being $900 million or so when you think about it as it relates to the, again, as the entire system. In terms of timing, as you can see, as you go through the filings, you will see that there were some costs we're asking to defer that will get really incurred product to the full functionality of the meters themselves. And we believe that's consistent with the matching of that cost with the benefits that you'll see -- that we'll going to implement as a result of the implementation of the meters themselves. There is also, I think as you recognize, as Drew mentioned, some asset investments that's made in advance of original deployment, basically, to develop the backbone to support the meter deployment. Our view is that asset investment is consistent with what we've seen from kind of a timing perspective and the necessity to get an employee in order to allow the efficient use of the meters themselves once they are fully deployed and recognize the full benefits of it. We also believe that infrastructure, as you spoke for other -- sort of other systems as well. So I think our perspective is the cost is consistent with what we've seen with implementations across the country. And it will be supported and supportive of the benefits that Leo mentioned, as we think about the implementation overall. I'd have to get specificity for you in terms of years but we don't view that investment to be significant investment at risk in advance of the meter deployment."

We had a significant amount of investment that I outlined, where it goes into the generation and transmission footprint of our regulated utility. That has not changed. If we continue to make those modernizing investments that would lower production cost provides significant benefits to our customers, improve the reliability, reduce our environmental footprint and the -- which is continuing to grow service territory, particularly, as it relates to what we see on the industrial side, all while we maintain some of the lowest rates in our country. In addition to that, what we just -- or in response to the question for Michael around AMI, AMI is the first step. And we just now start to make regulatory filings but first, we'll get the back office and the backbone of the systems and make it smart. We don't want to deploy the meters until they actually have something to do for us. So we're putting all of that in place in advance of actually beginning to deploy the meters in 2019. There are other technologies that we will deploy on the system then that we're looking at today in terms of asset management technologies and other things that will go from that point and forward, that will provide even greater benefits, savings, helping us to manage the load for our customers and provide that needed investment, that will provide us an earnings opportunity but at the same point in time, that will help us help customers manage their bills through the ability to manage how much they use, when they use it, et cetera. So that, for us, is again, total offense and extremely, extremely exciting for us as we look to the future. When we look at EWC, our objective has not changed. It's always been to separate that business from the Utility. And we continue to execute on that. We sold the wind assets or in the process of selling those. We sold the rice plant last year. We made the decision as unfortunate as they are. We shut down Pilgrim. We shut down Vermont Yankee. And we're going to continue on that path, albeit with a different price deck that we see continues to erode, but we're still working as diligent as we can. And I think the proof of that is in our discipline around, first, making the decision at FitzPatrick to seize operations there, but at the same time, never giving up and never wavering from the idea that we might come up with something better that resulted in the creation of the ZECs, working with Exelon and the states to come up with the sale of that plant, the continuation of its economic benefit and its reliability benefit to the state of New York and certainly to our employees and the communities. That for us isn't a defense at all. It's all offense. Like everyone else, we're in the merchant market, and gas prices have been low particularly in the Northeast, and we've got to manage around that, but it doesn't change what we're doing or how hard we're working or what we think we can accomplish there, and we've accomplished a lot. And we would anticipate over the course of the next couple of years, we'll continue to accomplish a lot. So all that said, we're pretty excited about what we have the opportunity to accomplish here. And again, just going through all that we just talked about with the sustainability of the nuclear fleet, the investment in AMI, the investment in the generation business, the investment in transmission going through the normal regulatory constructs that we have today and still maintaining our 2019 outlook sounds like offense to me. But strategically, that's where we're headed, the same place we were headed before, and we just updated some of the information for you, that's all."

We've changed not only who it is, but where it reports, whereas it used to report into the COO, it now reports in directly to me.

Today, we're announcing another solid quarter with operational earnings per share of $2.31. Adjusted earnings of $1.98 for our core Utility, Parent & Other business were substantially higher than last year, and in line with our growth expectations. We remain on track to meet this year's guidance for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share.
As our results show, we continue to execute on our strategy and meet our objectives both at the Utility and EWC. At the beginning of the year, we set out our to do list and shown on Slide 3. And with 3 quarters of 2016 now behind us, I'm happy to say that we've successfully completed most of those tasks.
Each of these accomplishments supports our objective of steady and predictable growth at the Utility, while managing risk and reducing our EWC footprint. At the Utility, we continue to make needed investments which will modernize our system and enhance sufficiency and reliability for the benefit of our customers. We have a number of generation projects in front of us which will meet this purpose.
First, the St. Charles Power Station is a 980-megawatt CCGT to be constructed and placed into service in Montz, Louisiana by June of 2019. The administrative law judge recommended supporting this certification of this project in July, and we're awaiting a final regulatory decision from the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The commission is faced with scheduling challenges, and it has been difficult for the full commission to take up major items for vote. However, we anticipate that the commission will be able to make a decision on this project before the end of the year.
On October 7, Entergy Texas made its filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, seeking the certification to construct the Montgomery County Power Station. This 993-megawatt highly efficient combined cycle plant will provide reliable power at significantly reduced energy costs. The plant will produce an expected $1.7 billion in net benefits to our Texas customers. In addition, the plant will use state-of-the-art emission control technology to lower air emissions. And construction, anticipated to begin in 2019, will provide more than 2,800 direct jobs in Texas and nearly $1 billion in economic activity to the local economy.
In June, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the New Orleans City Council seeking approval to construct the New Orleans Power Station. The 226-megawatt CT will provide a modern cost-effective local resource to enhance reliability and operational flexibility, mitigate market risks and aid in restoration efforts following major weather events. The construction of this plant will produce hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits for the state and local economy. We are currently working with the city council to set a procedural schedule.
And we expect to make filings with the Louisiana commission to begin the regulatory approval process for the Lake Charles CCGT later this year. This also will be a highly efficient plant that will support the growing customer base in the Lake Charles area. Additionally, we estimate the plant will provide around $1.4 billion in savings to customers over its lifetime.
Our transmission grid is equally vital for the operation of our system, and ongoing investments are required for compliance, reliability and efficiency. We continually make upgrades in additions to the grid to enhance our level of service and make room for growth. At the end of June, we completed Phase 2 of our Pine Bluff Voltage Support project in Arkansas, constructing a new 230 kV substation and transmission line. In July, we also finished the installation of a 230 kV line, a 500 kV-230 kV autotransformer and a 230 kV substation to better serve our customers in Texas.
Some of our transmission investment decisions are made through the annual MISO Transmission Expansion Planning process, also known as MTEP. We are nearing the end of the MTEP planning process for 2016.
Currently, we have 48 projects totaling roughly $480 million under consideration. The MISO board will make its selections and give final approval to projects in December. On September 15, we submitted about $700 million of proposed projects for MTEP '17, and we will work with MISO on the selection process for those proposals over the course of the next year.
For the last several years, we've been executing on these and other traditional generation and transmission projects. We've also begun to outline investments which will lay the foundation for an integrated energy network. To that end, on September 19, Entergy Arkansas was the first of our jurisdictions to make regulatory filings seeking approval for its commission for advanced metering implementation.
These were followed by filings from Entergy New Orleans on October 18. In each filing, we've requested that our regulators find the deployment of the advanced metering infrastructure to be in the public interests. Entergy Arkansas expects to recover its investment through its forward-looking FRP. Entergy New Orleans has requested approval to implement a phase-in customer charge. Deployment of this infrastructure, including advanced meters, is expected to bring total net benefits of approximately $260 million to our customers in Arkansas and New Orleans, in addition to improved outage restoration, enhanced customer service and tools to better manage energy usage.
Contingent on approval by the Arkansas Commission and the New Orleans City Council, meter deployment will begin in 2019. Ahead of meter deployment, we are focused on constructing and integrating the back-office systems that support this technology and make it smart, a meter data management system, a new outage management system and distribution management system as well as designing and installing the infrastructure for our communications network. Advanced meters are a big step forward, and the advantages they provide to our customers as well as the follow-on technologies and services they enable represent the future of our company and our industry.
I'd like to take a moment now to extend our sympathy to the family and friends of Clyde Holloway, the Louisiana Public Service Commission chair who recently passed away. Commissioner Holloway was consistently fair, dedicated to serving the public interest and true to his convictions. We appreciate his many years of public service.
Last Friday, the Governor of Louisiana appointed Charlie DeWitt, Former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, to fill the remaining months of Commissioner Holloway's term. We look forward to working with Commissioner DeWitt. As you know, we spent the last few years working with our regulators, Commissioner Holloway and others, for improvements in our regulatory constructs. These constructs are now facilitating our investments in the utility infrastructure.
For example, this quarter, Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement in its first FRP filing with a forward test year. We have requested any potential rate adjustments to be in effect on December 30. Entergy Mississippi completed its FRP filing with a stipulated settlement for a $19.4 million rate increase. Newer rates were effective in July 2016. Entergy Texas filed for a $19 million annual increase to its transmission cost recovery factor rider in September, reflecting $210 million of incremental transmission investment since its last base rate filing.
Entergy Texas also presented its view on alternative ratemaking mechanisms to the Public Utility Commission in Texas through a filing made in August. This filing was a response to the Texas Legislature's request for the commission to conduct a study and make recommendations regarding appropriate reforms to the ratemaking process. With its comments, Entergy Texas asserted their formulary plan in the forward test year as an effective mechanism to reduce regulatory lags. This mechanism would provide utilities with an opportunity to earn their authorized returns and is also beneficial to utility's credit ratings providing access to capital at lower cost to customers, and facilitating infrastructure investment to support economic development and the creation of jobs in Texas.
The commission will consider the filing along with the recommendations from others and provide its final ratemaking report to the Legislature in January.
And our FERC-regulated system agreement came to an end on September 1 after more than 50 years of existence. This agreement has been a source of litigation between Entergy and various retail regulators for years, and its elimination moves that risk and -- removes that risk and allows us to focus more specifically on the priorities and policies of the local regulators. You've also heard us talk about the importance of controlling bills for our customers. Our rates continue to be among the lowest in the country, and these low rates are one of the factors that make our region attractive for industrial development. We said there are a number of levers available to keep overall customer bills reasonable. In one such example, last month, $55 million of Mississippi storm restoration bonds for Hurricane Katrina were fully paid off, and we were able to remove that charge from our customers' bills. These are the first storm securitization bonds to roll off bills and more will follow for our customers in Louisiana in 2018, in Texas in 2021.
Shifting to our nuclear operations. We've recognized the importance of nuclear powers as part of the national energy landscape and the significant benefits our plants bring to our stakeholders. Nuclear power is a source of low-cost steady reliable baseload power. It provides fuel diversity to our generation portfolio and reduces fuel price volatility. It minimizes our environmental footprint by creating virtually no emissions. Each plant anchors its surrounding community with steady good-paying jobs, a significant property tax base and other ancillary economic benefits. And last but not least, we believe the plants are necessary to ensure the continued reliability of our electric grid.
We must preserve the benefits our plants provide and ensure that our operations are in line with evolving nuclear industry standards for operational excellence. This requires that we look at what investment is needed to ensure safe and reliable operations in the near term as well as what it will take to prepare plants to operate at the end of their expected operating lives.
As a result, going forward, the cost to operate our plants will be higher including investing to preserve these valuable resources for our customers, communities, employees and owners is an important part of our utility strategy. Our financial plan now includes the investments we believe are needed to meet our goals for nuclear operations as well as mitigating actions and rate treatment. Drew will discuss our revised earnings outlook and other outlook information in his remarks.
Turning briefly to EWC. Operational earnings for the quarter were essentially flat for the same quarter of last year. Like many merchant generators, we face market challenges, including very low commodity prices. These challenges are apparent and revised EWC EBITDA outlooks we've provided today and further validate the progress we continue to make on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint. 
On August 9, we announced our agreement to sell the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon. We recently received early termination of the HSR waiting period, and we continue to work through the required regulatory approvals with the NRC, FERC and the New York Public Service Commission. We are targeting the second quarter of 2017 to close the transaction. We also continue to pursue the long 2 parallel paths, both the plant's refueling and potential sale, and the possibility of permanent shutdown and decommissioning. Once again, I'd like to thank our FitzPatrick employees who continue to operate the plant safely and reliably throughout this transition. 
We're also entering into agreements this quarter to sell our EWC wind assets in Iowa and Texas, and expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to be disciplined in our assessment of every remaining asset in our EWC portfolio to execute on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint.
Many of you have heard about the mid-August rainstorms in South Louisiana, which brought devastation to so many of our customers as well as our employees. These historic rains dropped an estimated 7 trillion gallons of water in 1 week, damaging roughly 60,000 homes and businesses, and causing outages to more than 32,000 of our electric customers. Our crews worked tirelessly to restore power quickly and safely to customers. After the water receded, hundreds of Entergy employees from 4 states, friends and family members, all logged over 10,000 hours of volunteer service, helping to clean flooded homes. In addition, they collected needed tools and supplies, and provided meals to those in the area, coming together admirably to support each other and the affected community. To that end, Entergy contributed $525,000 to local nonprofit organizations to help them respond to the storm.
I'd also like to acknowledge those who were recently affected and suffered losses in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. Along with many of our peer utilities, Entergy provided over 400 workers to assist in restoration efforts. We were eager to respond to this call for help as others have done for us many times in the past. In many ways, events such as these are an important reminder of who we serve and what we do best. Supporting the communities where our customers and employees live has always been a part of who we are at Entergy and one of the many ways we power life. 
In recognition of efforts such as these as well as our other sustainable business practices, Entergy has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 15th consecutive year. We earned top scores in the areas of corporate citizenship and philanthropy, climate strategy, biodiversity and water-related risks. The index confirms that we are focused on the right things and successfully providing value to each of our core stakeholders. Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top 10 utilities in economic development in 2015. This is the ninth year in a row that we've been named to the list, recognizing our integral role that resulted in nearly $10 billion of capital investment and the creation of over 4,800 jobs in our service territory. We know that economic development is important for our customers across the region and it's also good for business. We will continue to work with our state agencies and local communities to promote growth across our service territory.
In summary, this was another solid quarter. Both our consolidated operational earnings and our adjusted earnings for our core business were substantially higher than last year and in line with our growth expectations. Our solid results to date demonstrate our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. With that backdrop, I'll also note that our financial outlooks now reflect our prudent decision to position the nuclear fleet for sustained operational excellence along with other nonfuel O&M adjustments such as increased benefit expenses due to the prolonged low interest rate environment and the industry-wide reality of flattening consumption from residential and commercial customers. 
Despite the near-term effects, the incorporation of these items in our financial outlooks strengthens our confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term goals as reflected in our unchanged 2019 outlook. As we look down the road to 2019 and beyond, we continue to see the benefits of the progress and accomplishments we've made over the past 24 months to execute on our objectives of steady predictable growth on Utility, Parent & Other earnings and corporate dividends. We look forward to talking with you some more about our plans and our outlooks at EEI next month. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

In addition to reviewing the quarterly results, I'll take some time today to talk about our longer-term outlook. We know that you are all anticipating an update on our nuclear investments and its financial effects, we decided to give you key information advance at EEI to help you better prepare for those meetings.
I'll start with key takeaways from our third quarter results on Slide 4, beginning with the consolidated results in the top left corner. As reported earnings included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close or sell. Last year's results included significant impairments for the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants. 
On an operational view, our consolidated earnings were $2.31 per share in the current period. This compares to $1.90 a share a year ago. The increase is due to growth in our core Utility, Parent & Other business shown in the top right corner. Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased more than 25% above last year, which I'll discuss shortly. Just a reminder, in our adjusted view, normalizes for special items, the estimated effects of weather and income taxes. Looking at the bottom left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat.
Operational earnings per share of Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.40 quarter-over-quarter, shown on Slide 5. Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.42. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investments that benefit customers and improve returns. Specific drivers include Entergy Arkansas' rate case, the Union Power Station acquisition, Entergy Mississippi's recent formulary rate plan and Entergy Texas' new transmission cost recovery rider.
Billed retail sales for the quarter were lower than a year ago. We continue to see weakness in both residential and commercial sales. Industrial sales were also lower even considering the continued growth from new and expansion customers. This is consistent with our comments last quarter. Despite the lower sales volume, industrial revenue was up, excluding rate effects because of the demand commanded for the bill and the new customers. For the full year, we anticipate industrial growth to be in line with our original guidance assumption of approximately 2.9%, and we expect industrial growth to continue into next year at around the same level. 
Also contributing to the UPO earnings increase was nonfuel O&M, which declined. Lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses were the largest driver. 
Turning to EWC's third quarter results, summarized on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.19 in the current quarter as compared to $0.18 a year ago. Effects from 2015 impairments were partly offset by lower energy prices. Decommissioning expense was also higher due to the establishment of decommissioning liabilities for Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick as a result of our agreement with NYPA to transfer the decommissioning trust and liabilities to Entergy. 
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow, which once again around $1 billion consistent with the same quarter last year.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 8. As you can see, we are affirming our 2016 guidance for consolidated operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. For the consolidated operational view, positive weather in the third quarter is being more than offset by lower EWC revenue and higher decommissioning expense for the NYPA trust transfer transaction. We also expect a slightly higher effective tax rate. Overall, we currently expect consolidated operational results will be within the bottom half of the range.
For Utility, Parent & Other, we still expect adjusted earnings for the year at around the midpoint of our guidance range. That said, there are a few things that we're keeping an eye on. As you know, we have the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project before the Louisiana Commission, and that issue is not yet fully resolved. Grand Gulf is also in an extended outage, and we will continue to monitor this potential implication. On the positive side, we recognized that our nonfuel O&M is favorable to our plan through the third quarter. We will continue to monitor our spending for opportunities in the fourth quarter.
In just under 2 weeks at EEI, we will discuss our strategy and longer-term views. However, I'd like to take a minute to talk about our financial outlooks, starting with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on Slide 9. At Analyst Day, we knew that we would have significant incremental spending to ensure the longer-term sustainability of our nuclear plants. Since then, we have spent the last few months going through the process that Chris Bakken outlined to help us understand the magnitude of the investment needed to position our fleet for sustained operational excellence. The low interest rate environment and its effect on our pension and postretirement benefit expenses was also discussed at the Analyst Day.
More recently, residential and commercial sales have been lower than our expectations, and we now expect a lower growth rate. Our goal is to fully mitigate these effects by identifying opportunities to operate our business more efficiently, reprioritizing projects among the business functions and utilizing regulatory mechanisms available to us as needed. Considering all of these, we now expect our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings to be lower in 2017 and 2018. However, we are still on track for greater than 5% 3-year growth based on the midpoints of our adjusted 2019 outlook versus our 2016 guidance.
Slide 10 illustrates the major changes from our original Utility, Parent & Other outlook to our current expectations. The primary drivers for our changes are: the aforementioned higher nuclear cost, lower pension discount rate and lower retail sales. These are expected to be about $0.75 in 2017, partially offset by mitigations we've identified over the past several months, which total about $0.25 in 2017, and increased net revenue from rate actions and other items which will help about $0.20 next year.
Regarding mitigations, we've worked hard over the past several months to identify opportunities. For example, on the last call, we talked about interest expense reductions from economic refinancings. We've also issued new debt at rates lower than we planned. In addition, we've identified O&M savings from various employee-led initiatives throughout the company, driving improvements in sourcing, benefits, insurance, outage operational and other costs over the next few years. Our outlook now reflects recovery of our prudent spending, net of mitigations through our normal ratemaking mechanisms.
On Slide 11, EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA outlook also reflects lower expectations. The summary of what's changed is provided on Slide 12. Like Utility, Parent & Other, net revenue and nonfuel O&M are the 2 key drivers for the changes at EWC. Revenue estimates declined due to lower forward prices and reduced volume from revised assumptions on outages, including at Indian Point to more conservatively planned additional time for potential replacement of baffle bolts.
As noted on Slide 13, we will have additional details at the EEI Financial Conference, where we will continue the discussion of our business strategy, including our nuclear investments, longer-term outlooks and 2017 drivers. As has been our practice, we anticipate that we will provide earnings guidance for 2017 and our detailed 3-year capital plan on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
We realize that we've covered a lot of new information today. We've also included some information on our nuclear investments in our preliminary 3-year capital plan in the appendix of our webcast presentation. We'll be listening to your questions today and over the next week, and we'll provide information that you need to understand and analyze these changes at EEI. 
We look forward to moving ahead with the strategies to create value for our owners, our customers, our employees and the communities we serve. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

It's something that we spend a lot of time trying to maintain. As you know, we already have some of the lowest rates in the country, 20% to 25% below the national average. And as far as the expenditures go, if they weren't prudent measures to make, we wouldn't make them. Between our mitigation actions as well as other items that are rolling off like securitizations that I mentioned in Mississippi, $55 million in 2018, we have roughly $1 billion of securitization bonds rolling out at the Louisiana jurisdictions just in that -- in utilizing our normal regulatory processes. We do believe that all the prudently incurred expenditures will be recovered. And also keep in mind here that when we look at the jurisdictions that are most impacted by the nuclear spend, namely, obviously, Arkansas and Louisiana, where the plants reside, you put everything together not just the spend that we've got, the tradition here but everything, and over the net -- over the period that we're talking about, we wouldn't expect the customer rates to increase by much more than 1%, including everything so far less than the rate of inflation annually. And so the impact here we're trying to manage as much as we can, all of the expenditures will be prudently incurred. We're putting all of our operations in line with what the industry is. As you know, every plant in the country is different, but that's certainly something that we've kept in mind when we've outlined this plan in terms of amount, in terms of timing, in terms of what we need to do to balance the equation not only for the operational side of things but for our customers. And again, we would envision we come out of the back side of this by the time we get to 2019, we'd still have some of the most competitive rates in the country."

Louisiana will flow through the FRP in the near term, but we do have some reset capability by the time we get out to 2019. Those are the major implications in terms of where the plants reside. And again, from an -- you asked about the trajectory. And if you look at the plan as we've laid it out now and not just that spend but everything together in those jurisdictions, we're talking about a trajectory of about that we wouldn't expect to be more than 1% a year from a rate standpoint. And remember, it's not only our mitigation -- mitigating actions that Drew outlined that are on the slides in your deck, things like the securitizations building off the load growth that we have, the continuation of the investments that we're making, as I outlined all those investments related to the new power plants, et cetera. We envision that those are going to provide production cost benefits as they're more efficient, et cetera. So all that kind of works together to keep that trajectory still in line with one of the best in the industry. I don't know, Theo, if you want to add to that."

In terms of timing, as you can see, as you go through the filings, you will see that there were some costs we're asking to defer that will get really incurred product to the full functionality of the meters themselves. And we believe that's consistent with the matching of that cost with the benefits that you'll see -- that we'll going to implement as a result of the implementation of the meters themselves. There is also, I think as you recognize, as Drew mentioned, some asset investments that's made in advance of meter deployment, basically, to develop the backbone to support the meter deployment. Our view is that asset investment is consistent with what we've seen from kind of a timing perspective and the necessity to get an employee in order to allow the efficient use of the meters themselves once they are fully deployed and recognize the full benefits of it. We also believe that infrastructure, as you spoke for other -- sort of other systems as well. So I think our perspective is the cost is consistent with what we've seen with implementations across the country. And it will be supported and supportive of the benefits that Leo mentioned, as we think about the implementation overall.

We had a significant amount of investment that I outlined that goes into the generation and transmission footprint of our regulated utility. That has not changed. If we continue to make those modernizing investments that would lower production cost provides significant benefits to our customers, improve the reliability, reduce our environmental footprint and the -- which is continuing to grow service territory, particularly, as it relates to what we see on the industrial side, all while we maintain some of the lowest rates in our country. In addition to that, what we just -- or in response to the question for Michael around AMI, AMI is the first step. And we just now started to make regulatory filings but first, we'll get the back office and the backbone of the systems and make it smart. We don't want to deploy the meters until they actually have something to do for us. So we're putting all of that in place in advance of actually beginning to deploy the meters in 2019. There are other technologies that we will deploy on the system then that we're looking at today in terms of asset management technologies and other things that will go from that point and forward, that will provide even greater benefits, savings, helping us to manage the load for our customers and provide that needed investment, that will provide us an earnings opportunity but at the same point in time, that will help us help customers manage their bills through the ability to manage how much they use, when they use it, et cetera. So that, for us, is again, total offense and extremely, extremely exciting for us as we look to the future. When we look at EWC, our objective has not changed. It's always been to separate that business from the Utility. And we continue to execute on that. We sold the wind assets or are in the process of selling those. We sold the RISE plant last year. We made the decision as unfortunate as they are to shut down Pilgrim, to shut down Vermont Yankee. And we're going to continue on that path, albeit with a different price deck that we see continues to erode, but we're still working as diligent as we can. And I think the proof of that is in our discipline around, first, making the decision at FitzPatrick to cease operations there, but at the same time, never giving up and never wavering from the idea that we might come up with something better that resulted in the creation of the ZECs, working with Exelon and the states to come up with the sale of that plant, the continuation of its economic benefit and its reliability benefit to the state of New York and certainly to our employees and the communities. That for us isn't a defense at all. It's all offense. Like everyone else, we're in the merchant market, and gas prices have been low particularly in the Northeast, and we've got to manage around that, but it doesn't change what we're doing or how hard we're working or what we think we can accomplish there, and we've accomplished a lot. And we would anticipate over the course of the next couple of years, we'll continue to accomplish a lot. So all that said, we're pretty excited about what we have the opportunity to accomplish here. And again, just going through all that we just talked about with the sustainability of the nuclear fleet, the investment in AMI, the investment in the generation business, the investment in transmission going through the normal regulatory constructs that we have today and still maintaining our 2019 outlook sounds like offense to me. But strategically, that's where we're headed, the same place we were headed before, and we just updated some of the information for you, that's all."

I'd say that the challenges we face stem from a desire to run a lean operation. And that lean operation meant to benefit our customers and getting the right balance between operational excellence and the cost structure. What we found, obviously, we've had a couple of situations with plants going into column 4, what we found is that we potentially didn't get the balance as right as we want. And so to get ourselves up to the standards that we hold ourselves to and to the standards of the industry, we've got to change our strategy around how we operate the plant. As you know, we made organizational changes last year, 6 months ago that we brought Chris in, and Chris has been responsible for developing what that strategy is. We've changed not only who it is, but where it reports, whereas it used to report into the COO, it now reports in directly to me. And so Chris and his team, along with his discussions with people in the industry and with regulators, et cetera, have devised this change in strategy to get ourselves up to where we need to be to meet our own standards and the operational excellence standards of the industry."

They fit right with the strategy that we've got everywhere else, whether it's investing in CCGTs that reduce production cost, that improve air emissions or whether it's looking at something in the gas and ground kind of investment that would limit fuel volatility. So these assets fit right into our strategy, right into the need for our committees, our customers.

Today, we're announcing another solid quarter with operational earnings per share of $2.31. Adjusted earnings of $1.98 for our core Utility, Parent & Other business were substantially higher than last year, and in line with our growth expectations. We remain on track to meet this year's guidance for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share.
As our results show, we continue to execute on our strategy and meet our objectives both at the Utility and EWC. At the beginning of the year, we set out our to do list and shown on Slide 3. And with 3 quarters of 2016 now behind us, I'm happy to say that we've successfully completed most of those tasks.
Each of these accomplishments supports our objective of steady and predictable growth at the Utility, while managing risk and reducing our EWC footprint. At the Utility, we continue to make needed investments which will modernize our system and enhance sufficiency and reliability for the benefit of our customers. We have a number of generation projects in front of us which will meet this purpose.
First, the St. Charles Power Station is a 980-megawatt CCGT to be constructed and placed into service in Montz, Louisiana by June of 2019. The administrative law judge recommended supporting this certification of this project in July, and we're awaiting a final regulatory decision from the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The commission is faced with scheduling challenges, and it has been difficult for the full commission to take up major items for vote. However, we anticipate that the commission will be able to make a decision on this project before the end of the year.
On October 7, Entergy Texas made its filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, seeking the certification to construct the Montgomery County Power Station. This 993-megawatt highly efficient combined cycle plant will provide reliable power at significantly reduced energy costs. The plant will produce an expected $1.7 billion in net benefits to our Texas customers. In addition, the plant will use state-of-the-art emission control technology to lower air emissions. And construction, anticipated to begin in 2019, will provide more than 2,800 direct jobs in Texas and nearly $1 billion in economic activity to the local economy.
In June, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the New Orleans City Council seeking approval to construct the New Orleans Power Station. The 226-megawatt CT will provide a modern cost-effective local resource to enhance reliability and operational flexibility, mitigate market risks and aid in restoration efforts following major weather events. The construction of this plant will produce hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits for the state and local economy. We are currently working with the city council to set a procedural schedule.
And we expect to make filings with the Louisiana commission to begin the regulatory approval process for the Lake Charles CCGT later this year. This also will be a highly efficient plant that will support the growing customer base in the Lake Charles area. Additionally, we estimate the plant will provide around $1.4 billion in savings to customers over its lifetime.
Our transmission grid is equally vital for the operation of our system, and ongoing investments are required for compliance, reliability and efficiency. We continually make upgrades in additions to the grid to enhance our level of service and make room for growth. At the end of June, we completed Phase 2 of our Pine Bluff Voltage Support project in Arkansas, constructing a new 230 kV substation and transmission line. In July, we also finished the installation of a 230 kV line, a 500 kV-230 kV autotransformer and a 230 kV substation to better serve our customers in Texas.
Some of our transmission investment decisions are made through the annual MISO Transmission Expansion Planning process, also known as MTEP. We are nearing the end of the MTEP planning process for 2016.
Currently, we have 48 projects totaling roughly $480 million under consideration. The MISO board will make its selections and give final approval to projects in December. On September 15, we submitted about $700 million of proposed projects for MTEP '17, and we will work with MISO on the selection process for those proposals over the course of the next year.
For the last several years, we've been executing on these and other traditional generation and transmission projects. We've also begun to outline investments which will lay the foundation for an integrated energy network. To that end, on September 19, Entergy Arkansas was the first of our jurisdictions to make regulatory filings seeking approval for its commission for advanced metering implementation.
These were followed by filings from Entergy New Orleans on October 18. In each filing, we've requested that our regulators find the deployment of the advanced metering infrastructure to be in the public interests. Entergy Arkansas expects to recover its investment through its forward-looking FRP. Entergy New Orleans has requested approval to implement a phase-in customer charge. Deployment of this infrastructure, including advanced meters, is expected to bring total net benefits of approximately $260 million to our customers in Arkansas and New Orleans, in addition to improved outage restoration, enhanced customer service and tools to better manage energy usage.
Contingent on approval by the Arkansas Commission and the New Orleans City Council, meter deployment will begin in 2019. Ahead of meter deployment, we are focused on constructing and integrating the back-office systems that support this technology and make it smart, a meter data management system, a new outage management system and distribution management system as well as designing and installing the infrastructure for our communications network. Advanced meters are a big step forward, and the advantages they provide to our customers as well as the follow-on technologies and services they enable represent the future of our company and our industry.
I'd like to take a moment now to extend our sympathy to the family and friends of Clyde Holloway, the Louisiana Public Service Commission chair who recently passed away. Commissioner Holloway was consistently fair, dedicated to serving the public interest and true to his convictions. We appreciate his many years of public service.
Last Friday, the Governor of Louisiana appointed Charlie DeWitt, Former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, to fill the remaining months of Commissioner Holloway's term. We look forward to working with Commissioner DeWitt. As you know, we spent the last few years working with our regulators, Commissioner Holloway and others, for improvements in our regulatory constructs. These constructs are now facilitating our investments in the utility infrastructure.
For example, this quarter, Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement in its first FRP filing with a forward test year. We have requested any potential rate adjustments to be in effect on December 30. Entergy Mississippi completed its FRP filing with a stipulated settlement for a $19.4 million rate increase. Newer rates were effective in July 2016. Entergy Texas filed for a $19 million annual increase to its transmission cost recovery factor rider in September, reflecting $210 million of incremental transmission investment since its last base rate filing.
Entergy Texas also presented its view on alternative ratemaking mechanisms to the Public Utility Commission in Texas through a filing made in August. This filing was a response to the Texas Legislature's request for the commission to conduct a study and make recommendations regarding appropriate reforms to the ratemaking process. With its comments, Entergy Texas asserted their formulary plan in the forward test year as an effective mechanism to reduce regulatory lags. This mechanism would provide utilities with an opportunity to earn their authorized returns and is also beneficial to utility's credit ratings providing access to capital at lower cost to customers, and facilitating infrastructure investment to support economic development and the creation of jobs in Texas.
The commission will consider the filing along with the recommendations from others and provide its final ratemaking report to the Legislature in January.
And our FERC-regulated system agreement came to an end on September 1 after more than 50 years of existence. This agreement has been a source of litigation between Entergy and various retail regulators for years, and its elimination moves that risk and -- removes that risk and allows us to focus more specifically on the priorities and policies of the local regulators. You've also heard us talk about the importance of controlling bills for our customers. Our rates continue to be among the lowest in the country, and these low rates are one of the factors that make our region attractive for industrial development. We said there are a number of levers available to keep overall customer bills reasonable. In one such example, last month, $55 million of Mississippi storm restoration bonds for Hurricane Katrina were fully paid off, and we were able to remove that charge from our customers' bills. These are the first storm securitization bonds to roll off bills and more will follow for our customers in Louisiana in 2018, in Texas in 2021.
Shifting to our nuclear operations. We've recognized the importance of nuclear powers as part of the national energy landscape and the significant benefits our plants bring to our stakeholders. Nuclear power is a source of low-cost steady reliable baseload power. It provides fuel diversity to our generation portfolio and reduces fuel price volatility. It minimizes our environmental footprint by creating virtually no emissions. Each plant anchors its surrounding community with steady good-paying jobs, a significant property tax base and other ancillary economic benefits. And last but not least, we believe the plants are necessary to ensure the continued reliability of our electric grid.
We must preserve the benefits our plants provide and ensure that our operations are in line with evolving nuclear industry standards for operational excellence. This requires that we look at what investment is needed to ensure safe and reliable operations in the near term as well as what it will take to prepare plants to operate at the end of their expected operating lives.
As a result, going forward, the cost to operate our plants will be higher including investing to preserve these valuable resources for our customers, communities, employees and owners is an important part of our utility strategy. Our financial plan now includes the investments we believe are needed to meet our goals for nuclear operations as well as mitigating actions and rate treatment. Drew will discuss our revised earnings outlook and other outlook information in his remarks.
Turning briefly to EWC. Operational earnings for the quarter were essentially flat for the same quarter of last year. Like many merchant generators, we face market challenges, including very low commodity prices. These challenges are apparent and revised EWC EBITDA outlooks we've provided today and further validate the progress we continue to make on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint. 
On August 9, we announced our agreement to sell the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon. We recently received early termination of the HSR waiting period, and we continue to work through the required regulatory approvals with the NRC, FERC and the New York Public Service Commission. We are targeting the second quarter of 2017 to close the transaction. We also continue to pursue the long 2 parallel paths, both the plant's refueling and potential sale, and the possibility of permanent shutdown and decommissioning. Once again, I'd like to thank our FitzPatrick employees who continue to operate the plant safely and reliably throughout this transition. 
We're also entering into agreements this quarter to sell our EWC wind assets in Iowa and Texas, and expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to be disciplined in our assessment of every remaining asset in our EWC portfolio to execute on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint.
Many of you have heard about the mid-August rainstorms in South Louisiana, which brought devastation to so many of our customers as well as our employees. These historic rains dropped an estimated 7 trillion gallons of water in 1 week, damaging roughly 60,000 homes and businesses, and causing outages to more than 32,000 of our electric customers. Our crews worked tirelessly to restore power quickly and safely to customers. After the water receded, hundreds of Entergy employees from 4 states, friends and family members, all logged over 10,000 hours of volunteer service, helping to clean flooded homes. In addition, they collected needed tools and supplies, and provided meals to those in the area, coming together admirably to support each other and the affected community. To that end, Entergy contributed $525,000 to local nonprofit organizations to help them respond to the storm.
I'd also like to acknowledge those who were recently affected and suffered losses in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. Along with many of our peer utilities, Entergy provided over 400 workers to assist in restoration efforts. We were eager to respond to this call for help as others have done for us many times in the past. In many ways, events such as these are an important reminder of who we serve and what we do best. Supporting the communities where our customers and employees live has always been a part of who we are at Entergy and one of the many ways we power life. 
In recognition of efforts such as these as well as our other sustainable business practices, Entergy has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 15th consecutive year. We earned top scores in the areas of corporate citizenship and philanthropy, climate strategy, biodiversity and water-related risks. The index confirms that we are focused on the right things and successfully providing value to each of our core stakeholders. Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top 10 utilities in economic development in 2015. This is the ninth year in a row that we've been named to the list, recognizing our integral role that resulted in nearly $10 billion of capital investment and the creation of over 4,800 jobs in our service territory. We know that economic development is important for our customers across the region and it's also good for business. We will continue to work with our state agencies and local communities to promote growth across our service territory.
In summary, this was another solid quarter. Both our consolidated operational earnings and our adjusted earnings for our core business were substantially higher than last year and in line with our growth expectations. Our solid results to date demonstrate our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. With that backdrop, I'll also note that our financial outlooks now reflect our prudent decision to position the nuclear fleet for sustained operational excellence along with other nonfuel O&M adjustments such as increased benefit expenses due to the prolonged low interest rate environment and the industry-wide reality of flattening consumption from residential and commercial customers. 
Despite the near-term effects, the incorporation of these items in our financial outlooks strengthens our confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term goals as reflected in our unchanged 2019 outlook. As we look down the road to 2019 and beyond, we continue to see the benefits of the progress and accomplishments we've made over the past 24 months to execute on our objectives of steady predictable growth on Utility, Parent & Other earnings and corporate dividends. We look forward to talking with you some more about our plans and our outlooks at EEI next month. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Drew."

In addition to reviewing the quarterly results, I'll take some time today to talk about our longer-term outlook. We know that you are all anticipating an update on our nuclear investments and its financial effects, we decided to give you key information advance at EEI to help you better prepare for those meetings.
I'll start with key takeaways from our third quarter results on Slide 4, beginning with the consolidated results in the top left corner. As reported earnings included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close or sell. Last year's results included significant impairments for the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants. 
On an operational view, our consolidated earnings were $2.31 per share in the current period. This compares to $1.90 a share a year ago. The increase is due to growth in our core Utility, Parent & Other business shown in the top right corner. Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased more than 25% above last year, which I'll discuss shortly. Just a reminder, in our adjusted view, normalizes for special items, the estimated effects of weather and income taxes. Looking at the bottom left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat.
Operational earnings per share of Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.40 quarter-over-quarter, shown on Slide 5. Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.42. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investments that benefit customers and improve returns. Specific drivers include Entergy Arkansas' rate case, the Union Power Station acquisition, Entergy Mississippi's recent formulary rate plan and Entergy Texas' new transmission cost recovery rider.
Billed retail sales for the quarter were lower than a year ago. We continue to see weakness in both residential and commercial sales. Industrial sales were also lower even considering the continued growth from new and expansion customers. This is consistent with our comments last quarter. Despite the lower sales volume, industrial revenue was up, excluding rate effects because of the demand commanded for the bill and the new customers. For the full year, we anticipate industrial growth to be in line with our original guidance assumption of approximately 2.9%, and we expect industrial growth to continue into next year at around the same level. 
Also contributing to the UPO earnings increase was nonfuel O&M, which declined. Lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses were the largest driver. 
Turning to EWC's third quarter results, summarized on Slide 6. Operational earnings were $0.19 in the current quarter as compared to $0.18 a year ago. Effects from 2015 impairments were partly offset by lower energy prices. Decommissioning expense was also higher due to the establishment of decommissioning liabilities for Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick as a result of our agreement with NYPA to transfer the decommissioning trust and liabilities to Entergy. 
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow, which once again around $1 billion consistent with the same quarter last year.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 8. As you can see, we are affirming our 2016 guidance for consolidated operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. For the consolidated operational view, positive weather in the third quarter is being more than offset by lower EWC revenue and higher decommissioning expense for the NYPA trust transfer transaction. We also expect a slightly higher effective tax rate. Overall, we currently expect consolidated operational results will be within the bottom half of the range.
For Utility, Parent & Other, we still expect adjusted earnings for the year at around the midpoint of our guidance range. That said, there are a few things that we're keeping an eye on. As you know, we have the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project before the Louisiana Commission, and that issue is not yet fully resolved. Grand Gulf is also in an extended outage, and we will continue to monitor this potential implication. On the positive side, we recognized that our nonfuel O&M is favorable to our plan through the third quarter. We will continue to monitor our spending for opportunities in the fourth quarter.
In just under 2 weeks at EEI, we will discuss our strategy and longer-term views. However, I'd like to take a minute to talk about our financial outlooks, starting with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on Slide 9. At Analyst Day, we knew that we would have significant incremental spending to ensure the longer-term sustainability of our nuclear plants. Since then, we have spent the last few months going through the process that Chris Bakken outlined to help us understand the magnitude of the investment needed to position our fleet for sustained operational excellence. The low interest rate environment and its effect on our pension and postretirement benefit expenses was also discussed at the Analyst Day.
More recently, residential and commercial sales have been lower than our expectations, and we now expect a lower growth rate. Our goal is to fully mitigate these effects by identifying opportunities to operate our business more efficiently, reprioritizing projects among the business functions and utilizing regulatory mechanisms available to us as needed. Considering all of these, we now expect our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings to be lower in 2017 and 2018. However, we are still on track for greater than 5% 3-year growth based on the midpoints of our adjusted 2019 outlook versus our 2016 guidance.
Slide 10 illustrates the major changes from our original Utility, Parent & Other outlook to our current expectations. The primary drivers for our changes are: the aforementioned higher nuclear cost, lower pension discount rate and lower retail sales. These are expected to be about $0.75 in 2017, partially offset by mitigations we've identified over the past several months, which total about $0.25 in 2017, and increased net revenue from rate actions and other items which will help about $0.20 next year.
Regarding mitigations, we've worked hard over the past several months to identify opportunities. For example, on the last call, we talked about interest expense reductions from economic refinancings. We've also issued new debt at rates lower than we planned. In addition, we've identified O&M savings from various employee-led initiatives throughout the company, driving improvements in sourcing, benefits, insurance, outage operational and other costs over the next few years. Our outlook now reflects recovery of our prudent spending, net of mitigations through our normal ratemaking mechanisms.
On Slide 11, EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA outlook also reflects lower expectations. The summary of what's changed is provided on Slide 12. Like Utility, Parent & Other, net revenue and nonfuel O&M are the 2 key drivers for the changes at EWC. Revenue estimates declined due to lower forward prices and reduced volume from revised assumptions on outages, including at Indian Point to more conservatively planned additional time for potential replacement of baffle bolts.
As noted on Slide 13, we will have additional details at the EEI Financial Conference, where we will continue the discussion of our business strategy, including our nuclear investments, longer-term outlooks and 2017 drivers. As has been our practice, we anticipate that we will provide earnings guidance for 2017 and our detailed 3-year capital plan on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
We realize that we've covered a lot of new information today. We've also included some information on our nuclear investments in our preliminary 3-year capital plan in the appendix of our webcast presentation. We'll be listening to your questions today and over the next week, and we'll provide information that you need to understand and analyze these changes at EEI. 
We look forward to moving ahead with the strategies to create value for our owners, our customers, our employees and the communities we serve. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

It's something that we spend a lot of time trying to maintain. As you know, we already have some of the lowest rates in the country, 20% to 25% below the national average. And as far as the expenditures go, if they weren't prudent measures to make, we wouldn't make them. Between our mitigation actions as well as other items that are rolling off like securitizations that I mentioned in Mississippi, $55 million in 2018, we have roughly $1 billion of securitization bonds rolling out at the Louisiana jurisdictions just in that -- in utilizing our normal regulatory processes. We do believe that all the prudently incurred expenditures will be recovered. And also keep in mind here that when we look at the jurisdictions that are most impacted by the nuclear spend, namely, obviously, Arkansas and Louisiana, where the plants reside, you put everything together not just the spend that we've got, the tradition here but everything, and over the net -- over the period that we're talking about, we wouldn't expect the customer rates to increase by much more than 1%, including everything so far less than the rate of inflation annually. And so the impact here we're trying to manage as much as we can, all of the expenditures will be prudently incurred. We're putting all of our operations in line with what the industry is. As you know, every plant in the country is different, but that's certainly something that we've kept in mind when we've outlined this plan in terms of amount, in terms of timing, in terms of what we need to do to balance the equation not only for the operational side of things but for our customers. And again, we would envision we come out of the back side of this by the time we get to 2019, we'd still have some of the most competitive rates in the country."

And again, from an -- you asked about the trajectory. And if you look at the plan as we've laid it out now and not just that spend but everything together in those jurisdictions, we're talking about a trajectory of about that we wouldn't expect to be more than 1% a year from a rate standpoint. And remember, it's not only our mitigation -- mitigating actions that Drew outlined that are on the slides in your deck, things like the securitizations building off the load growth that we have, the continuation of the investments that we're making, as I outlined all those investments related to the new power plants, et cetera.

And we believe that's consistent with the matching of that cost with the benefits that you'll see -- that we'll going to implement as a result of the implementation of the meters themselves. There is also, I think as you recognize, as Drew mentioned, some asset investments that's made in advance of meter deployment, basically, to develop the backbone to support the meter deployment. Our view is that asset investment is consistent with what we've seen from kind of a timing perspective and the necessity to get an employee in order to allow the efficient use of the meters themselves once they are fully deployed and recognize the full benefits of it.

I'd have to get specificity for you in terms of years but we don't view that investment to be significant investment at risk in advance of the meter deployment."

So I'm trying to figure out from an offense perspective or future growth, how are you looking at what are the dimensions that you can kind of push and grow going forward coming out from the defensive kind of view right now?"

We had a significant amount of investment that I outlined that goes into the generation and transmission footprint of our regulated utility. That has not changed. If we continue to make those modernizing investments that would lower production cost provides significant benefits to our customers, improve the reliability, reduce our environmental footprint and the -- which is continuing to grow service territory, particularly, as it relates to what we see on the industrial side, all while we maintain some of the lowest rates in our country. In addition to that, what we just -- or in response to the question for Michael around AMI, AMI is the first step. And we just now started to make regulatory filings but first, we'll get the back office and the backbone of the systems and make it smart. We don't want to deploy the meters until they actually have something to do for us. So we're putting all of that in place in advance of actually beginning to deploy the meters in 2019. There are other technologies that we will deploy on the system then that we're looking at today in terms of asset management technologies and other things that will go from that point and forward, that will provide even greater benefits, savings, helping us to manage the load for our customers and provide that needed investment, that will provide us an earnings opportunity but at the same point in time, that will help us help customers manage their bills through the ability to manage how much they use, when they use it, et cetera. So that, for us, is again, total offense and extremely, extremely exciting for us as we look to the future. When we look at EWC, our objective has not changed. It's always been to separate that business from the Utility. And we continue to execute on that. We sold the wind assets or are in the process of selling those. We sold the RISE plant last year. We made the decision as unfortunate as they are to shut down Pilgrim, to shut down Vermont Yankee. And we're going to continue on that path, albeit with a different price deck that we see continues to erode, but we're still working as diligent as we can. And I think the proof of that is in our discipline around, first, making the decision at FitzPatrick to cease operations there, but at the same time, never giving up and never wavering from the idea that we might come up with something better that resulted in the creation of the ZECs, working with Exelon and the states to come up with the sale of that plant, the continuation of its economic benefit and its reliability benefit to the state of New York and certainly to our employees and the communities. That for us isn't a defense at all. It's all offense. Like everyone else, we're in the merchant market, and gas prices have been low particularly in the Northeast, and we've got to manage around that, but it doesn't change what we're doing or how hard we're working or what we think we can accomplish there, and we've accomplished a lot. And we would anticipate over the course of the next couple of years, we'll continue to accomplish a lot. So all that said, we're pretty excited about what we have the opportunity to accomplish here. And again, just going through all that we just talked about with the sustainability of the nuclear fleet, the investment in AMI, the investment in the generation business, the investment in transmission going through the normal regulatory constructs that we have today and still maintaining our 2019 outlook sounds like offense to me. But strategically, that's where we're headed, the same place we were headed before, and we just updated some of the information for you, that's all."

This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy. We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station;",2793,"Thank you, David., and good morning, everyone. This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy. We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station; finalized our Arkansas rate case; received a final order in our distribution cost recovery factor filing in Texas; filed our first FRP with forward-looking features in Mississippi; completed the ANO NRC inspection; received confirmation from the New York ISO that the shutdown of Fitzpatrick will not affect reliability in the region; saw over 6% industrial sales growth versus last year; and today, we are reporting first quarter operational earnings per share of $1.35, above what we expected.
While that's a good start, we're also aware that it's early in the year and we'd face challenges ahead. But we're confident that we can manage these and deliver on our earnings commitments for the year as well as our adjusted Utility, Parent And Other long-term outlook. Our results for this quarter are the outcome of the strategy we have been pursuing for some time to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders in 2016 and beyond. At the utility, investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, which provides the financial flexibility we need to make these investments, and at EWC, continuing to reduce our footprint to limit exposure from assets not supported by the market. We've already materially reduced our size, risk and volatility through the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center and the shutdown of Vermont Yankee. This trend will only accelerate as Pilgrim and Fitzpatrick come offline. We will continue to emphasize safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial diligence at all sites.
If you turn your attention to our to-do list on Slide 3. On March 3, we closed the acquisition of the Union Power Station. This acquisition is both an important driver in achieving our 2016 earnings expectation, and also one more important step in our broader plan to modernize our fleet and provide lower cost reliable generation for our customers. Recovery of the cost of this investment in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans effectively began simultaneously with the transactions close, thanks to a collaborative agreement between our team, our regulators and other participants, who recognized the benefits of this investment for our customers.
Another important component of our supply plan is building the St. Charles power station. A hearing at the LPSC began April 18 and is expected to conclude today. Thus, we expect that the LPSC will be able to take up the certification decision in August. This is an important investment to serve our customers in Louisiana, and is an example of the infrastructure development that we're undertaking to position the utility for the future.
Beyond generation, we also continue to make significant progress on providing benefits to our customers through our transmission investments. We officially kicked off Entergy Louisiana's Lake Charles transmission project with a wire cutting ceremony in March. Once completed, this $150 million -- $159 million project will support continued reliability and service to a rapidly growing area in our service territory. On the regulatory front, we've also made progress towards better aligning the timing of our investments with the needs of our customers going forward. This will improve access to the capital needed to make the investments required to enhance the reliability and capability of our system and provide lower costs, more environmentally-friendly resources of generation for the benefit of our customers.
This ultimately supports economic development on our service territory, which strengthens communities, creates jobs and brings more financial stability to the regions we support. This quarter, we filed or concluded several major proceedings. First, we received the final order on our Arkansas rate case and rate adjustments became effective on February 24. We will make our first formula rate plan filing in July, under the new framework, using a future test year, which will bring more predictability and strength to Entergy Arkansas' financial profile. This new regulatory structure is the result of collaboration among a broad group of stakeholders and will help us be a stronger partner to attract jobs and economic expansion to Arkansas. Last month, Moody's acknowledged this view with an upgrade to Entergy Arkansas' long-term rating. Entergy Mississippi has also began to utilize its new formula rate plan with forward-looking features, and made its first filing on March 15. The filing reflects an anticipated earned ROE for the 2016 test year that is below the FRP bandwidth, indicating a $32.6 million rate increase to a point within the FRP bandwidth that reflects a 9.96% earned ROE.
A final order on that filing is expected before the end of the second quarter with the resulting rate adjustments to become effective around midyear.
And in February, the administrative law judge issued a proposal for a decision with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, on our transmission cost recovery filing. Based on the proposal for decision, we estimate $10 million to $11 million annual recovery on transmission spend, incremental to base rates. The use of this rider, along with the distribution cost rider we've been utilizing since January of 2016, will bring us greater financial flexibility to support the needs of our customers in Texas.
The Louisiana commission also recently opened 2 generic dockets on the income tax and corporate structure questions. The dockets were initiated in response to specific commissioner concerns regarding the Cleco transaction and the implications of that transaction's structure on taxes and rate making. While the dockets are generic and affect all LPSC jurisdictional utilities, we believe that the scope of the documents will be narrowly focused on those types of structures that gave rise to the dockets, and not on broader policy issues like tax normalization or tax-related matters previously approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Furthermore, we've worked constructively and transparently with the LPSC on tax-related matters. The LPSC is familiar with our tax positions, which have resulted in significant benefits to our customers.
The commission has 2 items regarding the Cleco transaction on its Business and Executive Session agenda on April 28, and we're hopeful they'll take that opportunity to clarify the scope of these dockets. We do not expect significant effects for ELL as a result of these dockets.
Finally, we carefully monitored the effects of investments and rate actions on our customer's builds, which today remain, on an average, 20% to 25% below the national average. In fact, our average residential rates remain below $0.10 per kilowatt hour.
Looking forward, we continue to explore solutions that will meet our customers' changing expectations in the evolving landscape of the utility industry. By introducing new technologies and renewable energy resources, we can build a grid that is cleaner, more resilient and affordable, and provides innovative opportunities in the way we interact and generate power for the benefit of all of our customers.
We're active on the renewables front with solar pilot power programs underway in Mississippi, New Orleans and Arkansas. Entergy Mississippi has completed 3 solar installations in 3 different locations, each capable of generating 500 kilowatts. Entergy New Orleans has begun construction of their 1 megawatt solar generation project with state-of-the-art battery storage technology. And Entergy Arkansas has entered into a power purchase agreement to facilitate construction of an 81-megawatt solar generating facility, which could be online as early as 2018.
These are the first steps towards assessing feasibility of utility scale solar generation, a resource that provides one way to help meet our voluntary commitment to stabilize our carbon dioxide emissions and reduce our environmental footprint.
At the same time, in 2015, our existing generating fleet continued to produce electricity at one of the lowest carbon dioxide emission rates in the United States. We are building on these pilot programs and we've initiated 3 new requests for proposals for renewable side generation resources to help meet long-term resource planning objectives in our service territory. These RFPs are seeking up to 200 megawatts of capacity for Louisiana, 100 megawatts for Arkansas and 20 megawatts for New Orleans. The on-pilot programs, we've also created a commercial development and innovation team dedicated to evaluating and integrating other new technologies in our operating model. That team focuses on addressing customer needs and expectations through product and service innovation, technology deployment and alternative service models and will also research and develop the enabling technologies that enhance the distribution grid and provide higher service and reliability for all of our customers.
For example, as I mentioned last quarter, we are moving forward with the process to install advanced meters in our distribution system. At our Analyst Day in June, we will give you more details around the next steps for deployment of advanced meters and, similar to our approach for our supply plan back in 2014, we'll provide the initial strokes around broader plans for other potential grid modernization efforts, to be followed with more details over time.
I would take a moment now to talk about initiatives to improve our nuclear operations.
First of all, our plants are safe. If they weren't, they would not be running. But this past year, the performance of nuclear fleet as a whole was not in line with our standards. Operational excellence is integral to our business model and a core competency we must maintain to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. We've made it a top priority in 2016 to strengthen the culture of operational excellence throughout our organization. I would like to extend my thanks to Tim Mitchell, who started this down this path, who is our interim Chief Nuclear Officer; and welcome Chris Bakken, who has officially joined us as the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Reporting directly to me, Chris will now lead these efforts in the nuclear organization. In January, as part of a comprehensive fleet-wide performance improvement plan, we formed a corporate event response team with industry assistance around best practices and increased engagement with all stakeholders. We are evaluating nuclear operations across our fleet, from top to bottom, and we continue to evaluate the need for process changes at each individual plant. And it's not just about column four, our main long-term objective is sustained operational excellence across our fleet.
This could result in incremental nuclear spending, and we're working hard to mitigate any financial implications. At ANO, the NRC completed its supplemental inspection and announced those results at a public meeting earlier this month. The NRC is confident that the problems have been identified and a comprehensive plan is being implemented to correct them. The NRC is expected to issue a confirmatory action letter in the next several weeks, and we plan to give you an update at Analyst Day.
Finally, it's important to emphasize that the NRC did recognize that the plant is safe to continue power operations, and that the actions taken today, have further improved the margin of safety, not only at ANO, but at all of our other nuclear facilities. Pilgrim is also working toward process improvements and the NRC will complete a supplementary inspection of that plant, with a focus on the corrective action program we've discussed, that resulted in entry into column 4 and a safety culture assessment. We'll inform the NRC when we're ready for that inspection, which we expect to be in the second half of this year.
Also, after careful consideration of the circumstances surrounding the plant's operations, we intend to refuel the plant in the spring of 2017, and run the plant safely through its current capacity market commitments with the ISO of New England, until the planned shutdown date of May 31st, 2019.
And in the end point, we are committed to resolving performance deficiencies and ensuring recovery in plant performance. We performed and completed comprehensive inspections during our planned refueling outage at unit 2. We detected additional work involving [indiscernible] bolts which we'll fully address -- we will fully address before restarting the plant. Subject to the completion of engineering analysis, we expect to be done with the additional work and have the plant back online around late June. Finally, we remain focused on safely operating the Fitzpatrick Plant through January 27, 2017, followed by a safe shutdown and eventual decommissioning of the facility. The decisions to shut down assets are very difficult. And we're proud of our employees who remain focused on safe operations and finishing strong.
I reiterate our commitment to support them and the communities affected by the difficult decisions we've made for these plants. Speaking of the communities we serve, we recognize that we play an important role as a corporate citizen in every region where we operate, and our core values resonate in the ways we support our communities. Improving educational and the economic opportunities for customers in our communities is one way we demonstrate our commitment. As part of a 5-year $5 million initiative to support workforce development training, we've made a $250,000 grant to Jobs for America's Graduates. This program equips at-risk youth with the skills needed to transition successfully to careers or college, addressing critical workforce needs, closing skill gaps and creating a competitive advantage for local communities.
The benefits of program like this one are long-lasting in providing opportunities for those who might not otherwise have some, and helping to raise the standard of living for a family for generations to come. We've also made a two-year $450,000 grant to the Red Cross to support disaster response in our communities. Recent floods damaged really 13,000 homes in Louisiana, and damage is still being assessed from this month's floods in Texas, highlighting the importance of a fast response in times of disaster.
Through our partnership with the Red Cross, Entergy is able to direct funds to communities following storms or other disasters, as they are needed, allowing help to be provided more quickly to those in need. I'm also proud of our initiatives, which help us maintain a diverse and engaged workforce. Veterans and active Reservists make valuable contributions to our company, and in recognition of our efforts to support National Guard and Reserve members, we've been selected as a finalist for the 2016 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. We're pleased to be considered for this honor, and we appreciate the sacrifice that these employees and their families make in their service to our country, as well as the unique skills and experiences that they bring to Entergy. These are just some of the efforts that got us ranked top quartile in Corporate Responsibility magazine's annual list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens. This is the 7th time we've been included on this list, which recognizes companies taking sustainable, responsible actions in areas such as employee relations, philanthropy and community support, environment and climate change.
Nowhere are these qualities are more important -- apparent than when our employees go above and beyond to serve our customers during their most difficult times. Many of you may have seen or read about the significant flooding in our service territory this quarter. Though our system withstood the conditions quite well, our employees were also very diligent in safely restoring power to those that needed it, repairing damaged infrastructure and even saving lives.
I'm excited about all that we've done so far in 2016 to execute on our strategy. This quarter was a good start to the year. The major undertakings we've completed will help drive our 2016 results. We're also aware of the challenges ahead, and more work needs to be done to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Everything we do is designed to support our objective to create value for each of our four stakeholders. We strive to deliver top quartile returns for our owners, provide top quartile satisfaction for our customers, achieve top quartile organization health scores and top decile safety performance for our employees, and maintain an active role in supporting our communities by achieving top decile performance for corporate social responsibility.
With these objectives in mind, we remain focused on the strategy we've developed to achieve those objectives. Steadily grow the utility by investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates, with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make those investments, and continue to reduce the EWC footprint while ensuring safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial due diligence for our assets.
We are off to a good start and will continue to execute through the remainder of the year on the plans that we've laid out. With that, I will turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the results for the quarter.

As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the results for the quarter. Turning to Slide 4, our operational earnings excluding special items were $1.35 per share, higher than we expected. This compares to $1.68 a year ago. This quarter's results varied from last year due to the effects of weather and a 2015 income tax item and Utility, Parent and Other, and lower wholesale power prices at EWC. These declines were partially offset by growth in the utility business.
In both periods, as reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close. These special items are for severance and retention costs as well as capital spending, which is being expensed. 
Turning to Utility, Parent and Other results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share decreased $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. However, the adjusted view on Slide 6, which excludes the effects of weather and income tax items, increased $0.19.
The growth in our base business is a result of our efforts in the last year to execute on our strategy to make productive investment that benefit customers and improve returns in our operating companies. Consistent with that strategy, Entergy Arkansas rate case is an important driver for the quarterly results. Rate adjustments were effective starting February 24, and included recovery for the Union Power Station acquisition. In addition, the final order allowed the deferral of $0.06 of previously expensed Fukushima and flood barrier compliance costs, which we collected over 10 years.
Combined, these items contributed about $0.15 to this quarter's earnings. 
A second driver of note was improved efforts to manage nonfuel O&M expense, which decreased $0.07 after excluding the deferral I just noted. The scope for [indiscernible] spending and benefit costs, including pension, were lower, while nuclear spending increased. This quarter, we also recorded a charge of approximately $0.05 associated with FERC quarters in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding, which came out last Thursday.
The charge represents the portion of EAI's estimated liability that would be attributable to its wholesale business and is not recoverable. This is a complex and technical case that continues on at the FERC, and the ultimate outcome is uncertain. We will provide additional details in our Form 10-Q.
Turning to sales. We also saw earnings contribution from over 6% industrial sales growth. Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the increase. About 70% of this quarter's increase came from new and expansion customers across several sectors as they continue to ramp and come online. Higher sales to existing customers were driven by petroleum refiners as fewer and shorter outages drove industrial sales growth in the quarter. This is expected to continue into 2Q.
Growth in new and expansion customers are also expected to continue through the rest of the year. However, given how strong refiners ran in the second half of last year and expected outages and changes in operational levels later this year, we expect industrial growth to be weighted towards the first half of 2016.
Turning to EWC's first quarter results summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.51 in the current quarter, $0.20 lower than the prior year. The single most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet average price was down more than $8 per megawatt hour or nearly 13%. In addition, realized earnings on decommissioning trust declined due to last year's rebalancing activity for BY's trust, which resulted in higher interest income in 2015. On the other hand, the effect of last year's impairments reduced fuel -- nuclear refueling outage and depreciation expenses, which benefited earnings approximately $0.16 this quarter.
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow for this quarter of $533 million, about $80 million lower than the same quarter in 2015. The largest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 10. As of today, we see adjusted Utility, Parent and Other earnings at our guidance midpoint. Recall, this excludes the effects of any weather or tax items. For our consolidated guidance, we must also consider negative weather to-date, EWC price declines since year-end and the extended outage at Indian Point unit 2. For IP 2, we've not yet completed our engineering analysis, but based on information to-date, our preliminary estimate is that the extended outage will reduce earnings by approximately $0.20. This is primarily from lost revenue, but also includes higher refueling outage costs, which we currently estimate to be around $20 million.
The higher outage cost will be amortized over the life of the outage, with the bulk of the earnings effect in 2017.
Looking at the balance of the year, there are additional risks and opportunities that could apply to both Utility, Parent and Other, as well as Entergy overall. As Leo mentioned, we have the potential for higher nuclear spending as we execute on our nuclear performance improvement plan. As always, there are potential risks to our sales forecasts. We also see opportunities to mitigate these challenges or provide upside, starting with management of our spending, some of which began in the first quarter.
In addition, as we mentioned in our last quarterly call, there's potential for income tax items, possibly as early as the second quarter of this year. Considering all these factors, we're affirming our guidance for the year. 
Moving to a longer-term view, Slide 11 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook, which is unchanged. Some of the challenges and opportunities that we've noted for '16, exist on an ongoing basis, and added uncertainty for -- with some added uncertainty for pension expenses, but also with the added benefit of efficient regulatory mechanisms. Our strategy to realize these results remains the same as we focus on making productive investments to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with timely and predictable investment recovery.
Slide 12 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook, assuming market prices as of March 31. One thing to note, is the root cause analysis is being both issues could prompt an accelerated inspection schedule for unit 3 in Indian Point. This is not reflected in our current estimates, and we plan to provide more information once our analysis is complete.
Before closing, I would like to give you a little more detail on our Analyst Day on June 9, in New York City, in Midtown. We'll talk about what's next for Entergy, and the utility growth opportunities before us. We will also provide some longer-term 5-year views and more detail on our nuclear performance improvement plan.
Our extended management team, including our new Chief Nuclear Officer, Chris Bakken, will be there to give you an opportunity to talk with them about their areas of responsibility. We look forward to seeing you there. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

And as we go forward throughout the year, we expect to see that, the comeback, as we look at growth state products in the regions that we serve, particularly Louisiana and Texas, we see that starting to kind of settle out and begin to trend upward, and we think that will help move those growth rates back to where -- to the more typical level. But again, energy efficiency will continue to have an impact on our residential and commercial sectors."

Anything we do would need to be consistent with the internal plan that we have right now.

And then some of the things that we've talked about as it relates to new technologies that we can deploy, whether it's the solar RFPs, et cetera, that I talked about, or the advanced metering or what's to come next. So we've got a significant organic growth opportunity in working through the investment plan, the financing plan and the regulatory structure around that to make it beneficial to our customers, first and foremost on our mind. So anything we do would have to be consistent with that objective -- with that strategy. So that's the first screen we go through, is, what would help us in that, whether its cash flow, balance sheet, other growth opportunities, technological synergies, et cetera. Secondly, we would want it to be transactable, something that we know we can have a really good chance of getting done, both through counterparty engagement. Price that make sense to us, on whatever side of the table we would sit on, and regulatory execution. And three, it cannot distract us from doing number 1. We don't want to have a couple of years of not doing the growth -- organic growth that we have today, while we try to do something that's supposed to help us get that done. So those 3 criteria continue. And to be -- the way we look at it, as you know, we evaluate this kind of thing on a regular ongoing basis. If anything comes up, we'll obviously let you know.

And we've done that at RISE, Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim, then its Fitzpatrick to follow. The plants that aren't supported by the market or that are and no longer fit the portfolio. As far as the operating plan, I think around -- just a lump, I think, Indian Point and Palisades in together, you'll certainly -- currently today they are not in the same situation necessarily as the other plants, as far as being cash flow positive. If they're not operating versus cash flow positive, if they are. You'll remember when we made those decisions around those facilities, we looked at 3 different things. One, what's the NPV of the facility, is it negative or positive? Two, what's the near-term cash flow burn rate, positive or negative? And three, how does the change of risk profile of the company. I think we achieved our objectives with all of those, including the RISE sale around that. And we continue to evaluate the other plants in a similar manner. The difference being, obviously, the PPA supports the cost structure at Palisades and the market supports the cost structure at Indian Point. As far as any kind of opportunities that we would have around those facilities, outside of the decisions we've already made, I can't really comment and wouldn't comment on that. Just because once we've started down that path, our strategy or our policy is to just not comment on those sorts of things. But like I said, we are looking at those in the same way, from an NPV, cash flow and risk standpoint, what are our options with those facilities. And we will pick the one that we believe creates the best value for our stakeholders. And again, is the NPV positive to run versus what our alternative will become? That will be a major driver. If it's Cash flow positive or negative, in particularly in the near term, for one of those alternatives to run the plant. And third, is the -- does it change the risk profile? And obviously, our view is that making that footprint; smaller does improve the risk profile of the company. And then, the last thing we always need to look at is the execution opportunity. Is it something similar to what I discussed on the question around M&A? There's a lot of things that we could do, but we have to make sure anything we do is executable both with the counterparty, our own point of view, and through the regulatory process."

If -- economics could've been different, and we've -- for example, we've been promoting a clean energy standard in New York, that would include nuclear plants for several years. And the reason, obviously, that we'd do that is, one, it's the right thing to do from a public policy standpoint. And it's certainly the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint, from an energy price standpoint to support the market's reliability, the whole 9 yards. And we've been promoting it for a number of years, because obviously, these things must take their course in the regulatory arena and then in the legislation -- legislative it's regulatory or the courts. 
And obviously, you can always expect there to be intervention into anything that comes up, and these things just take a long time to develop. And so, right now, there is no -- nothing in place. We don't know if there was something in place, what it would be. We don't know, if knew how it was structured, what it would provide. We don't know if, what it provided would be enough to support the economics of the plant. And we don't know that the timing of it could ever been done before we had to make the decision to go ahead and refuel, which then would come in to several hundred million dollars of losses. So we're out of time. It's not that we're against any of those proposals in terms of -- on their face, other than I would say that, that obviously, we believe that if there's a clean energy standard in New York that includes nuclear -- it should include all of the nuclear plants. And we commend them for their efforts, because we think that's the right thing to do, or we wouldn't have been proposing it for the last couple of years. I mean, you hit the nail on the head on this point of no return aspect. It's not in place. We don't know what it is. We don't know what it'll provide. We don't know what the economics would be, and for it to run its course, again, we're unfortunately, we're likely out of time. So anything that says we're opposed to a clean energy standard and the like, we're not. We've been for those all along. Again, we do think this should incorporate all plants in the state. We would be for all plants in the country, actually, to be consistent. But right now, there is nothing in place that we could look at, that would provide us the opportunity to change our decision."

This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy. We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station;",2793,"Thank you, David., and good morning, everyone. This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy. We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We've closed the acquisition of New Union Power Station; finalized our Arkansas rate case; received a final order in our distribution cost recovery factor filing in Texas; filed our first FRP with forward-looking features in Mississippi; completed the ANO NRC inspection; received confirmation from the New York ISO that the shutdown of Fitzpatrick will not affect reliability in the region; saw over 6% industrial sales growth versus last year; and today, we are reporting first quarter operational earnings per share of $1.35, above what we expected.
While that's a good start, we're also aware that it's early in the year and we'd face challenges ahead. But we're confident that we can manage these and deliver on our earnings commitments for the year as well as our adjusted Utility, Parent And Other long-term outlook. Our results for this quarter are the outcome of the strategy we have been pursuing for some time to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders in 2016 and beyond. At the utility, investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, which provides the financial flexibility we need to make these investments, and at EWC, continuing to reduce our footprint to limit exposure from assets not supported by the market. We've already materially reduced our size, risk and volatility through the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center and the shutdown of Vermont Yankee. This trend will only accelerate as Pilgrim and Fitzpatrick come offline. We will continue to emphasize safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial diligence at all sites.
If you turn your attention to our to-do list on Slide 3. On March 3, we closed the acquisition of the Union Power Station. This acquisition is both an important driver in achieving our 2016 earnings expectation, and also one more important step in our broader plan to modernize our fleet and provide lower cost reliable generation for our customers. Recovery of the cost of this investment in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans effectively began simultaneously with the transactions close, thanks to a collaborative agreement between our team, our regulators and other participants, who recognized the benefits of this investment for our customers.
Another important component of our supply plan is building the St. Charles power station. A hearing at the LPSC began April 18 and is expected to conclude today. Thus, we expect that the LPSC will be able to take up the certification decision in August. This is an important investment to serve our customers in Louisiana, and is an example of the infrastructure development that we're undertaking to position the utility for the future.
Beyond generation, we also continue to make significant progress on providing benefits to our customers through our transmission investments. We officially kicked off Entergy Louisiana's Lake Charles transmission project with a wire cutting ceremony in March. Once completed, this $150 million -- $159 million project will support continued reliability and service to a rapidly growing area in our service territory. On the regulatory front, we've also made progress towards better aligning the timing of our investments with the needs of our customers going forward. This will improve access to the capital needed to make the investments required to enhance the reliability and capability of our system and provide lower costs, more environmentally-friendly resources of generation for the benefit of our customers.
This ultimately supports economic development on our service territory, which strengthens communities, creates jobs and brings more financial stability to the regions we support. This quarter, we filed or concluded several major proceedings. First, we received the final order on our Arkansas rate case and rate adjustments became effective on February 24. We will make our first formula rate plan filing in July, under the new framework, using a future test year, which will bring more predictability and strength to Entergy Arkansas' financial profile. This new regulatory structure is the result of collaboration among a broad group of stakeholders and will help us be a stronger partner to attract jobs and economic expansion to Arkansas. Last month, Moody's acknowledged this view with an upgrade to Entergy Arkansas' long-term rating. Entergy Mississippi has also began to utilize its new formula rate plan with forward-looking features, and made its first filing on March 15. The filing reflects an anticipated earned ROE for the 2016 test year that is below the FRP bandwidth, indicating a $32.6 million rate increase to a point within the FRP bandwidth that reflects a 9.96% earned ROE.
A final order on that filing is expected before the end of the second quarter with the resulting rate adjustments to become effective around midyear.
And in February, the administrative law judge issued a proposal for a decision with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, on our transmission cost recovery filing. Based on the proposal for decision, we estimate $10 million to $11 million annual recovery on transmission spend, incremental to base rates. The use of this rider, along with the distribution cost rider we've been utilizing since January of 2016, will bring us greater financial flexibility to support the needs of our customers in Texas.
The Louisiana commission also recently opened 2 generic dockets on the income tax and corporate structure questions. The dockets were initiated in response to specific commissioner concerns regarding the Cleco transaction and the implications of that transaction's structure on taxes and rate making. While the dockets are generic and affect all LPSC jurisdictional utilities, we believe that the scope of the documents will be narrowly focused on those types of structures that gave rise to the dockets, and not on broader policy issues like tax normalization or tax-related matters previously approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Furthermore, we've worked constructively and transparently with the LPSC on tax-related matters. The LPSC is familiar with our tax positions, which have resulted in significant benefits to our customers.
The commission has 2 items regarding the Cleco transaction on its Business and Executive Session agenda on April 28, and we're hopeful they'll take that opportunity to clarify the scope of these dockets. We do not expect significant effects for ELL as a result of these dockets.
Finally, we carefully monitored the effects of investments and rate actions on our customer's builds, which today remain, on an average, 20% to 25% below the national average. In fact, our average residential rates remain below $0.10 per kilowatt hour.
Looking forward, we continue to explore solutions that will meet our customers' changing expectations in the evolving landscape of the utility industry. By introducing new technologies and renewable energy resources, we can build a grid that is cleaner, more resilient and affordable, and provides innovative opportunities in the way we interact and generate power for the benefit of all of our customers.
We're active on the renewables front with solar pilot power programs underway in Mississippi, New Orleans and Arkansas. Entergy Mississippi has completed 3 solar installations in 3 different locations, each capable of generating 500 kilowatts. Entergy New Orleans has begun construction of their 1 megawatt solar generation project with state-of-the-art battery storage technology. And Entergy Arkansas has entered into a power purchase agreement to facilitate construction of an 81-megawatt solar generating facility, which could be online as early as 2018.
These are the first steps towards assessing feasibility of utility scale solar generation, a resource that provides one way to help meet our voluntary commitment to stabilize our carbon dioxide emissions and reduce our environmental footprint.
At the same time, in 2015, our existing generating fleet continued to produce electricity at one of the lowest carbon dioxide emission rates in the United States. We are building on these pilot programs and we've initiated 3 new requests for proposals for renewable side generation resources to help meet long-term resource planning objectives in our service territory. These RFPs are seeking up to 200 megawatts of capacity for Louisiana, 100 megawatts for Arkansas and 20 megawatts for New Orleans. The on-pilot programs, we've also created a commercial development and innovation team dedicated to evaluating and integrating other new technologies in our operating model. That team focuses on addressing customer needs and expectations through product and service innovation, technology deployment and alternative service models and will also research and develop the enabling technologies that enhance the distribution grid and provide higher service and reliability for all of our customers.
For example, as I mentioned last quarter, we are moving forward with the process to install advanced meters in our distribution system. At our Analyst Day in June, we will give you more details around the next steps for deployment of advanced meters and, similar to our approach for our supply plan back in 2014, we'll provide the initial strokes around broader plans for other potential grid modernization efforts, to be followed with more details over time.
I would take a moment now to talk about initiatives to improve our nuclear operations.
First of all, our plants are safe. If they weren't, they would not be running. But this past year, the performance of nuclear fleet as a whole was not in line with our standards. Operational excellence is integral to our business model and a core competency we must maintain to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. We've made it a top priority in 2016 to strengthen the culture of operational excellence throughout our organization. I would like to extend my thanks to Tim Mitchell, who started this down this path, who is our interim Chief Nuclear Officer; and welcome Chris Bakken, who has officially joined us as the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Reporting directly to me, Chris will now lead these efforts in the nuclear organization. In January, as part of a comprehensive fleet-wide performance improvement plan, we formed a corporate event response team with industry assistance around best practices and increased engagement with all stakeholders. We are evaluating nuclear operations across our fleet, from top to bottom, and we continue to evaluate the need for process changes at each individual plant. And it's not just about column four, our main long-term objective is sustained operational excellence across our fleet.
This could result in incremental nuclear spending, and we're working hard to mitigate any financial implications. At ANO, the NRC completed its supplemental inspection and announced those results at a public meeting earlier this month. The NRC is confident that the problems have been identified and a comprehensive plan is being implemented to correct them. The NRC is expected to issue a confirmatory action letter in the next several weeks, and we plan to give you an update at Analyst Day.
Finally, it's important to emphasize that the NRC did recognize that the plant is safe to continue power operations, and that the actions taken today, have further improved the margin of safety, not only at ANO, but at all of our other nuclear facilities. Pilgrim is also working toward process improvements and the NRC will complete a supplementary inspection of that plant, with a focus on the corrective action program we've discussed, that resulted in entry into column 4 and a safety culture assessment. We'll inform the NRC when we're ready for that inspection, which we expect to be in the second half of this year.
Also, after careful consideration of the circumstances surrounding the plant's operations, we intend to refuel the plant in the spring of 2017, and run the plant safely through its current capacity market commitments with the ISO of New England, until the planned shutdown date of May 31st, 2019.
And in the end point, we are committed to resolving performance deficiencies and ensuring recovery in plant performance. We performed and completed comprehensive inspections during our planned refueling outage at unit 2. We detected additional work involving [indiscernible] bolts which we'll fully address -- we will fully address before restarting the plant. Subject to the completion of engineering analysis, we expect to be done with the additional work and have the plant back online around late June. Finally, we remain focused on safely operating the Fitzpatrick Plant through January 27, 2017, followed by a safe shutdown and eventual decommissioning of the facility. The decisions to shut down assets are very difficult. And we're proud of our employees who remain focused on safe operations and finishing strong.
I reiterate our commitment to support them and the communities affected by the difficult decisions we've made for these plants. Speaking of the communities we serve, we recognize that we play an important role as a corporate citizen in every region where we operate, and our core values resonate in the ways we support our communities. Improving educational and the economic opportunities for customers in our communities is one way we demonstrate our commitment. As part of a 5-year $5 million initiative to support workforce development training, we've made a $250,000 grant to Jobs for America's Graduates. This program equips at-risk youth with the skills needed to transition successfully to careers or college, addressing critical workforce needs, closing skill gaps and creating a competitive advantage for local communities.
The benefits of program like this one are long-lasting in providing opportunities for those who might not otherwise have some, and helping to raise the standard of living for a family for generations to come. We've also made a two-year $450,000 grant to the Red Cross to support disaster response in our communities. Recent floods damaged really 13,000 homes in Louisiana, and damage is still being assessed from this month's floods in Texas, highlighting the importance of a fast response in times of disaster.
Through our partnership with the Red Cross, Entergy is able to direct funds to communities following storms or other disasters, as they are needed, allowing help to be provided more quickly to those in need. I'm also proud of our initiatives, which help us maintain a diverse and engaged workforce. Veterans and active Reservists make valuable contributions to our company, and in recognition of our efforts to support National Guard and Reserve members, we've been selected as a finalist for the 2016 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. We're pleased to be considered for this honor, and we appreciate the sacrifice that these employees and their families make in their service to our country, as well as the unique skills and experiences that they bring to Entergy. These are just some of the efforts that got us ranked top quartile in Corporate Responsibility magazine's annual list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens. This is the 7th time we've been included on this list, which recognizes companies taking sustainable, responsible actions in areas such as employee relations, philanthropy and community support, environment and climate change.
Nowhere are these qualities are more important -- apparent than when our employees go above and beyond to serve our customers during their most difficult times. Many of you may have seen or read about the significant flooding in our service territory this quarter. Though our system withstood the conditions quite well, our employees were also very diligent in safely restoring power to those that needed it, repairing damaged infrastructure and even saving lives.
I'm excited about all that we've done so far in 2016 to execute on our strategy. This quarter was a good start to the year. The major undertakings we've completed will help drive our 2016 results. We're also aware of the challenges ahead, and more work needs to be done to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Everything we do is designed to support our objective to create value for each of our four stakeholders. We strive to deliver top quartile returns for our owners, provide top quartile satisfaction for our customers, achieve top quartile organization health scores and top decile safety performance for our employees, and maintain an active role in supporting our communities by achieving top decile performance for corporate social responsibility.
With these objectives in mind, we remain focused on the strategy we've developed to achieve those objectives. Steadily grow the utility by investing to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates, with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make those investments, and continue to reduce the EWC footprint while ensuring safe operations, regulatory compliance and commercial due diligence for our assets.
We are off to a good start and will continue to execute through the remainder of the year on the plans that we've laid out. With that, I will turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the results for the quarter.

As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the results for the quarter. Turning to Slide 4, our operational earnings excluding special items were $1.35 per share, higher than we expected. This compares to $1.68 a year ago. This quarter's results varied from last year due to the effects of weather and a 2015 income tax item and Utility, Parent and Other, and lower wholesale power prices at EWC. These declines were partially offset by growth in the utility business.
In both periods, as reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close. These special items are for severance and retention costs as well as capital spending, which is being expensed. 
Turning to Utility, Parent and Other results on Slide 5, operational earnings per share decreased $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. However, the adjusted view on Slide 6, which excludes the effects of weather and income tax items, increased $0.19.
The growth in our base business is a result of our efforts in the last year to execute on our strategy to make productive investment that benefit customers and improve returns in our operating companies. Consistent with that strategy, Entergy Arkansas rate case is an important driver for the quarterly results. Rate adjustments were effective starting February 24, and included recovery for the Union Power Station acquisition. In addition, the final order allowed the deferral of $0.06 of previously expensed Fukushima and flood barrier compliance costs, which we collected over 10 years.
Combined, these items contributed about $0.15 to this quarter's earnings. 
A second driver of note was improved efforts to manage nonfuel O&M expense, which decreased $0.07 after excluding the deferral I just noted. The scope for [indiscernible] spending and benefit costs, including pension, were lower, while nuclear spending increased. This quarter, we also recorded a charge of approximately $0.05 associated with FERC quarters in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding, which came out last Thursday.
The charge represents the portion of EAI's estimated liability that would be attributable to its wholesale business and is not recoverable. This is a complex and technical case that continues on at the FERC, and the ultimate outcome is uncertain. We will provide additional details in our Form 10-Q.
Turning to sales. We also saw earnings contribution from over 6% industrial sales growth. Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the increase. About 70% of this quarter's increase came from new and expansion customers across several sectors as they continue to ramp and come online. Higher sales to existing customers were driven by petroleum refiners as fewer and shorter outages drove industrial sales growth in the quarter. This is expected to continue into 2Q.
Growth in new and expansion customers are also expected to continue through the rest of the year. However, given how strong refiners ran in the second half of last year and expected outages and changes in operational levels later this year, we expect industrial growth to be weighted towards the first half of 2016.
Turning to EWC's first quarter results summarized on Slide 8. Operational earnings were $0.51 in the current quarter, $0.20 lower than the prior year. The single most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet average price was down more than $8 per megawatt hour or nearly 13%. In addition, realized earnings on decommissioning trust declined due to last year's rebalancing activity for BY's trust, which resulted in higher interest income in 2015. On the other hand, the effect of last year's impairments reduced fuel -- nuclear refueling outage and depreciation expenses, which benefited earnings approximately $0.16 this quarter.
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow for this quarter of $533 million, about $80 million lower than the same quarter in 2015. The largest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on Slide 10. As of today, we see adjusted Utility, Parent and Other earnings at our guidance midpoint. Recall, this excludes the effects of any weather or tax items. For our consolidated guidance, we must also consider negative weather to-date, EWC price declines since year-end and the extended outage at Indian Point unit 2. For IP 2, we've not yet completed our engineering analysis, but based on information to-date, our preliminary estimate is that the extended outage will reduce earnings by approximately $0.20. This is primarily from lost revenue, but also includes higher refueling outage costs, which we currently estimate to be around $20 million.
The higher outage cost will be amortized over the life of the outage, with the bulk of the earnings effect in 2017.
Looking at the balance of the year, there are additional risks and opportunities that could apply to both Utility, Parent and Other, as well as Entergy overall. As Leo mentioned, we have the potential for higher nuclear spending as we execute on our nuclear performance improvement plan. As always, there are potential risks to our sales forecasts. We also see opportunities to mitigate these challenges or provide upside, starting with management of our spending, some of which began in the first quarter.
In addition, as we mentioned in our last quarterly call, there's potential for income tax items, possibly as early as the second quarter of this year. Considering all these factors, we're affirming our guidance for the year. 
Moving to a longer-term view, Slide 11 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook, which is unchanged. Some of the challenges and opportunities that we've noted for '16, exist on an ongoing basis, and added uncertainty for -- with some added uncertainty for pension expenses, but also with the added benefit of efficient regulatory mechanisms. Our strategy to realize these results remains the same as we focus on making productive investments to benefit customers, while maintaining competitive rates with timely and predictable investment recovery.
Slide 12 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook, assuming market prices as of March 31. One thing to note, is the root cause analysis is being both issues could prompt an accelerated inspection schedule for unit 3 in Indian Point. This is not reflected in our current estimates, and we plan to provide more information once our analysis is complete.
Before closing, I would like to give you a little more detail on our Analyst Day on June 9, in New York City, in Midtown. We'll talk about what's next for Entergy, and the utility growth opportunities before us. We will also provide some longer-term 5-year views and more detail on our nuclear performance improvement plan.
Our extended management team, including our new Chief Nuclear Officer, Chris Bakken, will be there to give you an opportunity to talk with them about their areas of responsibility. We look forward to seeing you there. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

So we actually were about $0.07, $0.08 ahead at EWC versus our previous expectation. The balance of that was that utility, some of it, was the -- or the bulk of the O&M savings that we saw above expectation were in the fossil area as we came through the outage season, we actually did much better than we have historically. And then in the balance of it, as you referenced, there was some conservatism built into the Arkansas rate case. So we -- that was justified at the -- right at the very end, we did lose $5 million of comp, but that spread out differently than we've built the conservatism into our case. Some of those Fukushima and flood barrier costs were not part of our expectations for the quarter but they were able to stay in at that final order. And then, some timing elements were, for the period between February 24 and April 1, went in our favor, but they weren't in our overall expectation. So that's more of a timing shift between periods.

And we've done that at RISE, Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim, then its Fitzpatrick to follow. The plants that aren't supported by the market or that are and no longer fit the portfolio. As far as the operating plan, I think around -- just a lump, I think, Indian Point and Palisades in together, you'll certainly -- currently today they are not in the same situation necessarily as the other plants, as far as being cash flow positive. If they're not operating versus cash flow positive, if they are. You'll remember when we made those decisions around those facilities, we looked at 3 different things. One, what's the NPV of the facility, is it negative or positive? Two, what's the near-term cash flow burn rate, positive or negative? And three, how does the change of risk profile of the company. I think we achieved our objectives with all of those, including the RISE sale around that. And we continue to evaluate the other plants in a similar manner. The difference being, obviously, the PPA supports the cost structure at Palisades and the market supports the cost structure at Indian Point. As far as any kind of opportunities that we would have around those facilities, outside of the decisions we've already made, I can't really comment and wouldn't comment on that. Just because once we've started down that path, our strategy or our policy is to just not comment on those sorts of things. But like I said, we are looking at those in the same way, from an NPV, cash flow and risk standpoint, what are our options with those facilities. And we will pick the one that we believe creates the best value for our stakeholders. And again, is the NPV positive to run versus what our alternative will become? That will be a major driver. If it's Cash flow positive or negative, in particularly in the near term, for one of those alternatives to run the plant. And third, is the -- does it change the risk profile? And obviously, our view is that making that footprint; smaller does improve the risk profile of the company. And then, the last thing we always need to look at is the execution opportunity. Is it something similar to what I discussed on the question around M&A? There's a lot of things that we could do, but we have to make sure anything we do is executable both with the counterparty, our own point of view, and through the regulatory process."

If -- economics could've been different, and we've -- for example, we've been promoting a clean energy standard in New York, that would include nuclear plants for several years. And the reason, obviously, that we'd do that is, one, it's the right thing to do from a public policy standpoint. And it's certainly the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint, from an energy price standpoint to support the market's reliability, the whole 9 yards. And we've been promoting it for a number of years, because obviously, these things must take their course in the regulatory arena and then in the legislation -- legislative it's regulatory or the courts. 
And obviously, you can always expect there to be intervention into anything that comes up, and these things just take a long time to develop. And so, right now, there is no -- nothing in place. We don't know if there was something in place, what it would be. We don't know, if knew how it was structured, what it would provide. We don't know if, what it provided would be enough to support the economics of the plant. And we don't know that the timing of it could ever been done before we had to make the decision to go ahead and refuel, which then would come in to several hundred million dollars of losses. So we're out of time. It's not that we're against any of those proposals in terms of -- on their face, other than I would say that, that obviously, we believe that if there's a clean energy standard in New York that includes nuclear -- it should include all of the nuclear plants. And we commend them for their efforts, because we think that's the right thing to do, or we wouldn't have been proposing it for the last couple of years. I mean, you hit the nail on the head on this point of no return aspect. It's not in place. We don't know what it is. We don't know what it'll provide. We don't know what the economics would be, and for it to run its course, again, we're unfortunately, we're likely out of time. So anything that says we're opposed to a clean energy standard and the like, we're not. We've been for those all along. Again, we do think this should incorporate all plants in the state. We would be for all plants in the country, actually, to be consistent. But right now, there is nothing in place that we could look at, that would provide us the opportunity to change our decision."
