I will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and annual performance, and then provide an overview of the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. We will then turn the call to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.
From a financial perspective, in the first quarter, we delivered Enterprise revenue of $13.62 billion, improved our non-GAAP operating income rate by 10 basis points to 5.9%, and delivered a better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.53 versus $1.48 last year. In our Domestic business, we exceeded our bottom line expectations due to a well executed holiday plan, a disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returns and clearance product and strong expense management. 
While Domestic revenue declined 1.5%, it was against a backdrop where the NPD reported categories were down 5.1%. Strong performance in health and wearables, home theater and appliances was more than offset by softness in the mobile phone category and continued declines in tablets. In addition, we continue to significant growth in the online channel with e-commerce revenue increasing nearly 14% to 15.6% of total Domestic revenue. In the International business, our performance was better than expected on the top and bottom lines, while revenue declined at 26.2% due to the expected impacts of foreign currency and store closures in Canada. Revenue retention from the brand consolidation continued to exceed our expectations. This high retention in addition to a more effective promotional strategy, drove a 30-basis-point increase in the International non-GAAP operating income rate to 4.7%. 
On a full year basis, fiscal 2016 marks the second year in a row we increased our Domestic revenue and expended our operating margin. We also continued to do to make significant progress against our Renew Blue strategy. So during the year, we continue to gain share in appliances in nearly all of our traditional consumer-electronics categories. We grew Domestic online revenue 13% to over $4 billion or 11% of total Domestic revenue. We increased our Net Promoter Score by over 300 basis points. We continue to improve our employee engagement scores and decreased employee turnover. We deepened our partnerships with top tech companies in the world. We delivered $150 million against our $400 million Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program. We consolidated brands and embarked on a significant transformation in Canada, including the closure of 68 stores. And finally, in 1 year, we returned $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders, including $1 billion in share repurchases, which was originally planned to be completed over 3 years.
This performance is the direct result of the execution of our Renew Blue strategy and the hard work, dedication and customer focus on the part of all of our associates. I am proud to recognize them publicly this morning.
Turning to fiscal 2017. We are entering the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. Our purpose from a customers' standpoint is to build a company that does a unique job of helping customers, learn about and enjoy the latest technology. As we begin this next phase, in fiscal 2017, we will execute against the following priorities: Number 1, build and our strong industry position in multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business; number 2, drive cost reduction and efficiency; and number 3, advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation.
So our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business, more specifically, we will implement a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital, chores services and supply chain. For example, in home theater, we will build on the superior customer experience we've created in partnership with our key vendors, and leverage the strength of our market-leading share in 4K and large-screen televisions. We will also add 5 Magnolia Design Centers stores-within-a-store, bringing our total to 84 by year end. 
In appliances, we expect to continue to grow our market share by adding an incremental 27 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store, bringing our total to 203 at year-end, and by leveraging the new vendor appliance experiences that we launched in Q3 of last year.  Additionally, we expect to see incremental growth from our enhanced delivery and installation offerings, which are driving high conversion and material improvements in NPS, Net Promoter Score.
In Connected Home, we will continue to increase our assortment in emerging categories, including security, writing and video monitoring, expand our in-store presentation, and leverage our leading position in routers and networking equipment which from the backbone of the Connected Home.
In mobile phones, we will capitalize on the customer experience investments we've communicated late last year with an expectation to drive increased in version, as well as a reduced wait time for our customers. Our strategy is to be an advocate for every phone order by offering the best deal in plans and devices, in partial advice, in clarity and efficiency, we can be a complex process.
In the very short time, we believe high smartphone penetration, combined with low consumer demand for current product offerings, it's depressing the category. But over the course of the year, we believe that more compelling phone launches can fuel renewed growth in the category.
From an online standpoint, we will continue to build out new digital capabilities, prioritizing the customer shopping experience on phones and tablet devices. Examples of recent advances include the successful Q4 launch of Blue Assist, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call and e-mail. For example, its touch ID login, included in our latest mobile app update, and of course, our recently launched Geek Squad app.
In our retail stores, we will continue to drive increased sales proficiency and further leverage our service capabilities. In fiscal 2016, our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents contributed significantly to our NPS and market share gains, and we believe that continues to be significant further opportunity to take this competitive advantage to the next level.
And then finally, in our International business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation. We will continue to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and a financial performance.
Our second priority for fiscal 2017 is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. We do see costs is essential for us to be able to fund our investment, build our resilience to product cycle, and increase our profitability over time. Furthermore, based on the -- on current economic factors and softness in the consumer-electronics industry, it is essential that we be proactive on the cost reduction front.  A key element of our approach to achieving this is to simplify our business processes to simultaneously improve the customer experience and drive costs down. 
As an example, we have a project focused on reducing the amount of open box appliances we take into our stores by addressing root cause issues. This project has a potential to know the improve the customer experience, but also to drive material savings from lower markdowns, lower transportation costs and better use of labor in our stores and distributions centers.
Are broadly, we aspire to achieve world-class operational levels of performance, defined in terms of quality, service and cost. This focus has to be a way of life, especially given our margin structure and the volatility of our industry.
Last year, we announced a specific cost reduction and gross profit optimization program called Renew Blue Phase 2, with the goal of $400 million of over 3 years, on top of the $1 billion we eliminated as part of Phase 1. Against that goal, in the fiscal 2016, we achieved $150 million, leaving us with $250 million. 
In light of our increased focus on cost and productivity, we believe there are incremental savings that can be achieved above and beyond our current goal which we will update you on as we progress.  Partially offsetting these savings will be our expected future investments in the areas of labor expertise, services pricing and key growth initiatives, which I will discuss in a moment.  In fiscal 2016, these investments totaled approximately $100 million, and we expect a similar level in fiscal 2017 which to be clear, will be funded by our cost savings.
Our third priority is to advance key initiatives to more deeply transform Best Buy in order to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short and precious, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity which environment. The event of the Internet of Things is providing a new technology way that is making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant to customers. We are investing to be the leading technology experts which makes it easy to learn about and confidently enjoy the Best Buy. 
In this context, we believe we have ongoing growth opportunities around key product categories as well as from increasing our share of wallet with existing customers, and acquiring new customers within our target segments, who are those of us passionate about technology and need help with it. Capturing these opportunities, we require that we do the following: Number 1, develop and bring to market curated solution driven merchandise to solve key customer problems, in particular, in new growth areas and; number 2, ensure we have an inspirational and educational sales approach across all sales channels that helps customers understand the value that technology can create for them; number 3, help customers unleash responsible from their technology; and number 4, provide customers with ongoing convenient purchase support.  Inherent in all of this is the desire to build a stronger ongoing relationship with our customers.
Now our services capabilities in Geek Squad are key building blocks of this strategy. We understand that we've discussed service-related opportunities many times in the past. And while it is not visible in our services top line results today, we are, in fact, making progress to bring these opportunities to life. To do so, we've had to spend time in the last 2 years fixing many aspects of our traditional warranty and repair businesses. We've also had to adjust our pricing in warranty business. We are seeing the results of our efforts through substantial increases in Net Promoter Score's, higher total customer interactions and from a financial point of view, the periodic profit-sharing payments we earned this year.  We are also beginning to see improved attach rates as we enter fiscal 2017.
Building on this, we will continue our work to improve the customer experience and enhance our service offering and capabilities in support of our mission to help customers learn about and enjoy the latest tech. 
While we are energized with a potential of this opportunity, the work necessary to capture it, it takes time. Thus, fiscal 2017 will be another year of gradual and incremental improvement, with more meaningful results expected in fiscal 2018.
Now before I turn the call over to Sharon, I'd like to provide some thoughts about our fiscal 2017 outlook and return of capital plan. So in summary, Best Buy is a specialty retailer that excels in an industry characterized by product innovation cycles. We are undeterred by this fact, as we believe there will always be technology innovation and an imperative is that in these cycles, we continue to deliver superior execution against what's in recognizing that the cycles any point in time.
In fiscal 2017, we are focused on continue to build in our foundation to both drive and capitalize on these technology cycles. In parallel, we are focused key initiatives that we discussed today that we believe will result in stickier relationship with our customers, provide profitable revenue even during down cycles, and continue to create long-term shareholder value.
More over time as the fruits of these key initiatives materialize, we expect to accelerate our revenue and operating income growth by taking advantage of opportunities provided by ongoing technology innovation and the need to customers have for help.
In the short term, we will be characterized by our strong cash flow generating capabilities in our intent to regularly return excess free cash flow to shareholders. 
From a financial outlook perspective for fiscal 2017, based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out in our Domestic business, we are expecting revenue declines in the first half followed by growth in the back half. We also expect that our strong execution in operational capabilities will allow us to continue to gain market share. In this context, we are targeting flat Domestic revenue for the full year due to continued growth in appliances, connected home and home theater, in particular, but recognize that being flat will be challenging without the strong mobile cycle, and improvements in the NPD reported categories overall. 
Despite the soft line -- the soft top line environment, we will target flattish operating income, including the lapping of the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our services client portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016.
A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. In addition, we intend to reward our shareholders by being a premium dividend payer, and increasing our earnings per share through ongoing share repurchases. I would now like to talk about our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan. 
After 3 consecutive years of strong cash flow generation in the Renew Blue, we believe that now is an ideal time to provide a view of our long-term capital allocation strategy. This strategy is based on our strong cash position today and our ongoing confidence in our future cash flow generation.
At the core of this strategy is our intent to: First, fund our operations and growth and investments, including potential acquisitions; and then to return the remaining excess free cash flow to our shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy targets the return of excess free cash flow to shareholders through a 35% to 45% non-GAAP dividend payout ratio, and regular share repurchases with the minimum annual expectation of offsetting dilution from equity compensation.
So in line with this strategy, our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan includes: Number 1, the 22% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share; number 2, the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next 2 years; and number 3, a special dividend of $0.45 per share or approximately $145 million.
This is in addition to the $1.5 billion in cash we returned to shareholders in fiscal 2016. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our Q1 fiscal '17 guidance."

Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release.Enterprise revenue of $13.6 billion w",1134,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release.
Enterprise revenue of $13.6 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.9%, however, exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected profitability in both our Domestic and International businesses driven by a more affected, disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returned and clearance products, and an approximate $0.02 of additionally EPS from the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio.
Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 34%, resulting in an incremental $0.02 of EPS versus expectations. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year.
Enterprise revenue declined 4.1% to $13.6 billion, primarily due to a 1.8% comparable sales decline in the Domestic business, and negative foreign currency impact of approximately 140 basis points, and the negative impact of Canadian store closures. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.05 or 3% to $1.53. This increase was primarily driven by the service periodic profit-sharing benefit of $0.19, and a share repurchase benefit of $0.06. These benefits were partially offset by Domestic revenue declines in the mobile phone, tablet and digital imaging categories and the expected $0.03 negative impact from the Canadian brand consolidation.
In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 1.5% to $12.5 billion. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.8%, excluding the estimated 10 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and the loss of revenue from 13 large format and 17 small format Best Buy mobile store closures. These declines were partially offset by the 10-basis-point benefit associated with installment billing and the approximate 80 basis points services periodic profit-sharing benefits, which is not included in our comparable sales calculation.
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by a significant declines and mobile phones, tablets, digital imaging and services. 
In services, comparable revenue declined 11.9% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven by lower frequency and severity of claims on extended warranty.
In our International segment, revenue declined 26.2% to $1.1 billion due to a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points, the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry.
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 21.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 21.6%. This increase was primarily due to a 65-basis-point impact from the services periodic profit-sharing benefit and the improved rates in the mobile and computing categories, primarily due to a more disciplined promotional strategy. These increases were partially offset by an increased mix of lower margin wearable devices, a decreased mix of higher-margin digital imaging products, a lower rate in televisions driven by a decline in average selling prices and higher distribution costs and our investments in services pricing.
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 21.8%. This increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year gross profit rates in both Canada and Mexico due to a more disciplined promotional strategy.
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.1 billion or 15.7% of revenue, a decrease of $68 million, but an increase of 20 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.95 billion or 15.6% of revenue, and was nearly flat in dollars  year-over-year as investments in future growth initiatives and lower vendor funding being recorded as an offset to SG&A were offset by the flow of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions and lower incentive compensation.
From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.
International non-GAAP SG&A was $192 million or 17.2% of revenue, a decrease of $70 million or 10 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
Specific to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred non-GAAP diluted EPS impact of negative $0.03 in the fourth quarter and negative $0.07 for fiscal 2016. These impacts were lower than expected due to higher sales retention from closed stores, a more discipline promotional strategy and our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year in order to pilot results.
In Q1 of fiscal '17, Canada will still be lopping 68 of its store closures last year, and facing ongoing foreign currency in Canadian economic headwinds. As such, in Q1, we expect International revenues to decline 15% to 20%. 
Beginning in the second quarter and through the balance of the year, while currency and economic headwinds will continue to be a challenge, in constant currency, the International business is expected to be near flat on both the top and bottom line.
From a cash flow perspective, and a full year basis, capital expenditures totaled $649 million, and we returned $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders. 
In working capital, our decision to bring holiday inventory in early as well as insuperable moving into Q1 fiscal '17 resulted in a total every longer and hiring costs payable prior to year-end. This created a timing issue, which resulted in our ratio of accounts payable to inventory being lower at year end than last year. As we look forward to next year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of the $650 million to $700 million, and the accounts payable to inventory ratio is expected to increase.
I would now like to talk about our Q1 financial guidance. In the Domestic business, we believe that the softness that we saw in the NPD tracked categories and mobile phones will continue into Q1. We also believe that in the International business, revenue will be down by approximately 15% to 20% due to ongoing impacts of foreign currency and the Canadian brand consolidation which was not executed until late March of 2015.  With that backdrop, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.35 billion, and Enterprise comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%, primarily driven by continued softness in the mobile and tablet categories.
Our non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 39% to 39.5%, and our not Q1 I'm diluted earnings per share is expected the be the range of $0.31 to $0.35, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 326 million.
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So talking about the future in this industry is always interesting and let me try to be as helpful as possible. As we look ahead in particular, fiscal '17, the areas where we see key growth opportunities for us, around appliances, where we, as you know, we've had multiple quarters, multiple years now of growth, and that's going to continue to be driven by the housing recovery. Second is connected objects, so around the connected -- the Internet of Things, Connected Home, and then of course, there's the continued TV cycle. The specific categories you talk about, so in particular, virtual reality, we are very sided. We have this promotion. Find a ready disinterested the buying the Galaxy S7, you can preorder now at Best Buy, and you get a free virtual reality gear, and then some additional memory, so great value. Candidly, this is an interesting category. I think it will still be small this year. It may help in the computing category with higher end computers, because you're going to need that computing power.
But it's from a financial standpoint, it's going to be limited. Mobile, I think I'm going to stick to my prepared remarks. It's going to be a function of new products revising the category. And I'm not going to make any forward-looking statement on that particular point. TV is, of course, we've been very excited and performing really well with 4K and large-screen TVs. Our share has been increasing. Of course, like any cycle, it's not going to continue forever, so it's not going to be a strong going forward as it has been from a growth rate standpoint. Connected Home, I think it's an exciting category. Increasingly, it's not just about the security cameras or the smart logs and so forth. Everything in your home is connected, at least in my home. Your smart TV is connected. Your music, your streaming, your home office is connected, gaming is connected. And of course, getting into security, home automation, energy management. And the complexity of this -- if you think about this, with the control layer, the security layer, the networking layer, the access layer, provides a lot of complexity. And so the continued innovation and the complexity creates a big opportunity for us. So we're seeing growth amid comments about the fact that we are increasing the assortments, the presentation and we're voting on our strength in routers and networking. So we'll see continued growth in that growth space of connected objects and the Internet of Things."

But rest assured that we will continue to rationalize as we deem it appropriate. The great news is that the stores that remain in our portfolio, they are performing. The key for us is improving and increasing our retention rates in the U.S. Unlike Canada where the stores were literally in the same parking lot, a mile away, 3 miles away, in the U.S., we never built our portfolio that way.

The services revenue decline, there's a piece which we've called nonproductive revenue, which is the -- which is driven by the lower frequency and cost severity related to the clients. As a relates to the productive revenue, which is the one that we care about, the trend is starting to evolve because we have price investment, and then we have provided for you in Q4 and that's going to, of course, carry over into this fiscal year. And it is partially offset by the -- we're seeing -- beginning of an increase in the attach rates. We never expected it -- expect the attach rates to full year offset the price investment. This is an area, frankly, where the elasticity is much lower than on the key hardware categories. But we thought it was the right thing to do from a customers' standpoint as we look ahead. As relates to -- a periodic payment from the warranty portfolio, last year was an exceptional year. And we've disclosed every quarter, the amounts. It was driven by again, the improved performance of our service portfolio, so nothing to be shy about around that. But this was an exceptional year because it was multiple -- it was twice the amounts. Now looking ahead in this fiscal year, we'll get some continued improvement in that business as the improved operational performance, severity and frequency, will carry over -- not so much in the form of periodic payments, but in the form of lower cost charged to the portfolio, not nearly close to the amount of fiscal '16, but some portion. Now what's exciting for us is that we get to lap the party exceptional payment last year, and we're able to do this through the increased focus on cost and efficiency."

We did bring our inventories in earlier, and customers are shopping earlier and earlier. So that in retrospect, has turned out to be an excellent decision for us. In addition to that, we have had a significant focus on restocking in our stores, and have made some operational changes in our stores for down stocking. That also -- pay dividends to us during the fourth quarter. In addition, unsure from store, we continue to believe that strategically, ship-from-store will be -- go down in our history at Best Buy as one of the most important strategic decisions that we made because it is allowing us to utilize both our online and our retail inventories to serve the online customers.

Increasingly, it's difficult to measure because as many of you visit our stores, the shop-in-shop are in many, many of our stores -- so it's really hard to measure scientifically with great precision. However, when you see increased market share, there is no doubt in -- as an example, increased market share in 4K high-end TVs or in appliances, there is no doubt that this has been a key driver of our performance. Looking ahead, there's no doubt that in terms of physical shop-in-shop, there's left to be done, right, because we have high penetration of these shop-in-shops. So I think that looking ahead, we have the opportunity to partner in some cases more deeply with the vendors, in particular, in how we deliver this promise of making it easy to learn about and enjoy the technology. So around help and service and classes, I think there is deeper integration opportunities where the vendors and we are very excited about that as well."

And we believe that we will be revealing those overtime to you. We put the $400 million out there, and obviously, you know that we don't communicate anything that we don't have the exact execution plan behind it to you guys. So as we start developing those plans and may become more crystallized, we will definitely be communicating that. What we wanted to make sure that you guys took away from today's call is that, that $400 million is the bottom of what we believe is possible, and that with these additional opportunities that we've been identifying in the back half of this year, that we continue to believe that there is substantially more opportunity there. So we'll keep you posted as we go. Let's get the $400 billion delivered as well, and then we can talk about more. But there is no doubt that based on some of the looking -- and you guys see that it's very structural, and they're going to come through that product flow and how it comes through Best Buy, it's going to come through our return process, especially on large cube inventory, there is so much opportunity there. There is recovery on inventory that is returned. It's how we handle the movement across the United States with some of our large cube inventory. This comes in many forms. The great news is it comes in many forms. And it is -- there is no lack of opportunity. And I'm going to take 1 more-minute just to lay a backup for why is there this much opportunity at Best Buy. The reason we have these opportunities is because if you think about the growth years for Best Buy, they were opening 50 stores a year and adding $1 billion to $2 billion a year of incremental revenue. And during that time, when you have that kind of growth, trying to keep pace with all of the operational excellence that goes behind that, what you end up doing is creating a large number of triage processes, meaning that while we don't have the system to do this, so we're going to create this workaround and it will work. And then the work around it gets bigger and bigger and bigger as the company continues to grow. But just about the time to get ready to fix it, they've just added another 50 stores another $2 billion worth of revenue and of course, that was the focus back then. Now that the company has reached such scale, these opportunities, these workarounds have become very costly. And that's the opportunity that we have to take them out. But leave it to understand that they are structural, and a lot of change has to happen. And that's why you don't just throw them out there on a list and say, yes, I totally -- I've got to be communicating that we need to give you guys clarity to the road map."

I will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and annual performance, and then provide an overview of the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. We will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.
From a financial perspective, in the first quarter, we delivered Enterprise revenue of $13.62 billion, improved our non-GAAP operating income rate by 10 basis points to 5.9%, and delivered a better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.53 versus $1.48 last year. In our Domestic business, we exceeded our bottom line expectations due to a well executed holiday plan, a disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returns and clearance product, and strong expense management. 
While Domestic revenue declined 1.5%, it was against a backdrop where the NPD reported categories were down 5.1%. Strong performance in health and wearables, home theater and appliances was more than offset by softness in the mobile phone category and continued declines in tablets. In addition, we continue to drive significant growth in the online channel with e-commerce revenue increasing nearly 14% to 15.6% of total Domestic revenue. In the International business, our performance was better than expected on the top and bottom lines, while revenue declined 26.2% due to the expected impacts of foreign currency and store closures in Canada. Revenue retention from the brand consolidation continued to exceed our expectations. This high retention in addition to a more effective promotional strategy, drove a 30-basis-point increase in the International non-GAAP operating income rate to 4.7%. 
On a full year basis, fiscal 2016 marks the second year in a row we increased our Domestic revenue and expanded our operating margin. We also continued to make significant progress against our Renew Blue strategy. So during the year, we continue to gain share in appliances and nearly all of our traditional consumer electronics categories. We grew Domestic online revenue 13% to over $4 billion or 11% of total Domestic revenue. We increased our Net Promoter Score by over 300 basis points. We continue to improve our employee engagement scores and decreased employee turnover. We deepened our partnerships with the top tech companies in the world. We delivered $150 million against our $400 million Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program. We consolidated brands and embarked on a significant transformation in Canada, including the closure of 68 stores. And finally, in 1 year, we returned $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders, including $1 billion in share repurchases, which was originally planned to be completed over 3 years.
This performance is the direct result of the execution of our Renew Blue strategy and the hard work, dedication and customer focus on the part of all of our associates. I am proud to recognize them publicly this morning.
Turning to fiscal 2017. We are entering the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. Our purpose from a customers' standpoint is to build a company that does a unique job of helping customers learn about and enjoy the latest technology. As we begin this next phase, in fiscal 2017, we will execute against the following priorities: Number 1, build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business; number 2, drive cost reduction and efficiencies; and number 3, advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation.
So our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business, more specifically, we will implement a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital towards services and supply chain. For example, in home theater, we will build on the superior customer experience we've created in partnership with our key vendors, and leverage the strength of our market-leading share in 4K and large-screen televisions. We will also add 5 Magnolia Design Centers stores-within-a-store, bringing our total to 84 by year end. 
In appliances, we expect to continue to grow our market share by adding an incremental 27 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store, bringing our total to 203 at year-end, and by leveraging the new vendor appliance experiences that were launched in Q3 of last year.  Additionally, we expect to see incremental growth from our enhanced delivery and installation offerings, which are driving high conversion and material improvements in NPS, Net Promoter Score.
In Connected Home, we will continue to increase our assortment in emerging categories, including security, lighting and video monitoring, expand our in-store presentation, and leverage our leading position in routers and networking equipment which form the backbone of the Connected Home.
In mobile phones, we will capitalize on the customer experience investments we implemented late last year with an expectation to drive increased conversion as well as reduce wait time for our customers. Our strategy is to be an advocate for every phone order by offering the best deal and plans and devices, impartial advice, and clarity and efficiency in what can be a complex process.
In the very short time, we believe high smartphone penetration, combined with low consumer demand for current product offerings, is depressing the category. Over the course of the year, we believe that more compelling phone launches can fuel renewed growth in the category.
From an online standpoint, we will continue to build out new digital capabilities, prioritizing the customer shopping experience on phone and tablet devices. Examples of recent advances include the successful Q4 launch of Blue Assist, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call and e-mail. Another example is Touch ID login, included in our latest mobile app update, and of course, our recently launched Geek Squad app.
In our retail stores, we will continue to drive increased sales proficiency and further leverage our service capabilities. In fiscal 2016, our Blue Shirt and Geek Squad agents contributed significantly to our NPS and market share gains, and we believe there continues to be significant further opportunity to take this competitive advantage to the next level.
And then finally, in our International business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation. We will continue to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance.
Our second priority for fiscal 2017 is to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing costs is essential for us to be able to fund our investment, build our resilience to product cycles, and increase our profitability over time. Furthermore, based on the -- on current economic factors and softness in the consumer electronics industry, it is essential that we be proactive on the cost reduction front.  A key element of our approach to achieving this is to simplify our business processes to simultaneously improve the customer experience and drive cost out. 
As an example, we have a project focused on reducing the amount of open box appliances we take into our stores by addressing root cause issues. This project has the potential to not only improve the customer experience, but also to drive material savings through lower markdowns, lower transportation costs, and better use of labor in our stores and distributions centers.
More broadly, we aspire to achieve world-class operational levels of performance, defined in terms of quality, service and cost. This focus has to be a way of life, especially given our margin structure and the volatility of our industry.
Last year, we announced a specific cost reduction and gross profit optimization program called Renew Blue Phase 2, with the goal of $400 million over 3 years, on top of the $1 billion we eliminated as part of Phase 1. Against that goal, in the fiscal 2016, we achieved $150 million, leaving us with $250 million. 
In light of our increased focus on cost and productivity, we believe there are incremental savings that can be achieved above and beyond our current goal which we will update you on as we progress.  Partially offsetting these savings will be our expected future investments in the areas of labor expertise, services pricing and key growth initiatives, which I will discuss in a moment.  In fiscal 2016, these investments totaled approximately $100 million, and we expect a similar level in fiscal 2017 which to be clear, will be funded by our cost savings.
Our third priority is to advance key initiatives to more deeply transform Best Buy in order to drive future growth and differentiation. While they may be short and precious, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity-rich environment. The advent of the Internet of Things is providing a new technology way that is making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant to customers. We are investing to be the leading technology expert which makes it easy to learn about and confidently enjoy the Best Tech. 
In this context, we believe we have ongoing growth opportunities around key product categories as well as from increasing our share of wallet with existing customers, and acquiring new customers within our target segments for those of us passionate about technology and need help with it. Capturing these opportunities, will require that we do the following: Number 1, develop and bring to market curated solution-driven merchandise to solve key customer problems, in particular, in new growth areas and; number 2, ensure we have an inspirational and educational sales approach across all sales channels that helps customers understand the value that technology can create for them; number 3, help customers unleash whats possible from their technology; and number 4, provide customers with ongoing convenient purchase support.  Inherent in all of this is the desire to build a stronger ongoing relationship with our customers.
Now our services capabilities in Geek Squad are key building blocks of this strategy. We understand that we've discussed service-related opportunities many times in the past. And while it is not visible in our services top line results today, we are, in fact, making progress to bring these opportunities to life. To do so, we've had to spend time in the last 2 years fixing many aspects of our traditional warranty and repair businesses. We've also had to adjust our pricing in warranty business. We are seeing the results of our efforts through substantial increases in Net Promoter Scores, higher total customer interactions and from a financial point of view, the periodic profit-sharing payments we earned this year.  We are also beginning to see improved attach rates as we enter fiscal 2017.
Building on this, we will continue our work to improve the customer experience and enhance our service offering and capabilities in support of our mission to help customers learn about and enjoy the latest tech. 
While we are energized by the potential of this opportunity, the work necessary to capture it, it takes time. Thus, fiscal 2017 will be another year of gradual and incremental improvement, with more meaningful results expected in fiscal 2018.
Now before I turn the call over to Sharon, I'd like to provide some thoughts about our fiscal 2017 outlook and return of capital plan. So in summary, Best Buy is a specialty retailer that excels in an industry characterized by product innovation cycles. We are undeterred by this fact, as we believe there will always be technology innovation and imperative is that in these cycles we continue to deliver superior execution against what is in our control recognizing that the cycles rarely align at any point in time.
In fiscal 2017, we are focused on continuing to build on our foundation to both drive and capitalize on these technology cycles. In parallel, we are focused on building the key initiatives that we discussed today that we believe will result in stickier relationship with our customers, provide profitable revenue even during down cycles, and continue to create long-term shareholder value.
Over time as the fruits of these key initiatives materialize, we expect to accelerate our revenue and operating income growth by taking advantage of opportunities provided by ongoing technology innovation and the need customers have for help.
In the short term, we will be characterized by our strong cash flow generating capabilities and our intent to regularly return excess free cash flow to shareholders. 
From a financial outlook perspective for fiscal 2017, based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out in our Domestic business, we are expecting revenue declines in the first half followed by growth in the back half. We also expect that our strong execution and operational capabilities will allow us to continue to gain market share. In this context, we are targeting flat Domestic revenue for the full year due to continued growth in appliances, Connected Home and home theater, in particular, but recognize that being flat will be challenging without a strong mobile cycle, and improvements in the NPD reported categories overall. 
Despite the soft line -- the soft top line environment, we will target flattish operating income, including the lapping of the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016.
A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. In addition, we intend to reward our shareholders by being a premium dividend payer, and increasing our earnings per share through ongoing share repurchases. I would now like to talk about our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan. 
After 3 consecutive years of strong cash flow generation under Renew Blue, we believe that now is an ideal time to provide a view of our long-term capital allocation strategy. This strategy is based on our strong cash position today and our ongoing confidence in our future cash flow generation.
At the core of this strategy is our intent to: First, fund our operations and growth investments, including potential acquisitions; and then to return the remaining excess free cash flow to our shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy targets the return of excess free cash flow to shareholders through a 35% to 45% non-GAAP dividend payout ratio, and regular share repurchases with the minimum annual expectation of offsetting dilution from equity compensation.
So in line with this strategy, our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan includes: Number 1, the 22% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share; number 2, the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next 2 years; and number 3, a special dividend of $0.45 per share or approximately $145 million.
This is in addition to the $1.5 billion in cash we returned to shareholders in fiscal 2016. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our Q1 fiscal '17 guidance."

Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release.Enterprise revenue of $13.6 billion w",1136,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release.
Enterprise revenue of $13.6 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.9%, however, exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected profitability in both our Domestic and International businesses driven by a more affective, disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returned and clearance products, and an approximate $0.02 of additionally EPS from the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio.
Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 34%, resulting in an incremental $0.02 of EPS versus expectations. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year.
Enterprise revenue declined 4.1% to $13.6 billion, primarily due to a 1.8% comparable sales decline in the Domestic business, and negative foreign currency impact of approximately 140 basis points, and the negative impact of Canadian store closures. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.05 or 3% to $1.53. This increase was primarily driven by the service periodic profit-sharing benefit of $0.19, and a share repurchase benefit of $0.06. These benefits were partially offset by Domestic revenue declines in the mobile phone, tablet and digital imaging categories and the expected $0.03 negative impact from the Canadian brand consolidation.
In our Domestic segments, revenue decreased 1.5% to $12.5 billion. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.8%, excluding the estimated 10 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and the loss of revenue from 13 large format and 17 small format Best Buy mobile store closures. These declines were partially offset by the 10-basis-point benefit associated with installment billing and the approximate 80 basis points services periodic profit-sharing benefits, which is not included in our comparable sales calculation.
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by significant declines in mobile phones, tablets, digital imaging and services. 
In services, comparable revenue declined 11.9% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven by lower frequency and severity of claims on extended warranties.
In our International segment, revenue declined 26.2% to $1.1 billion due to a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points, the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry.
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 21.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 21.6%. This increase was primarily due to a 65-basis-point impact from the services periodic profit-sharing benefit and improved rates in the mobile and computing categories, primarily due to a more disciplined promotional strategy. These increases were partially offset by an increased mix of lower margin wearable devices, a decreased mix of higher-margin digital imaging products, a lower rate in televisions driven by a decline in average selling prices and higher distribution costs and our investments in services pricing.
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 21.8%. This increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year gross profit rates in both Canada and Mexico due to a more disciplined promotional strategy.
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.1 billion or 15.7% of revenue, a decrease of $68 million, but an increase of 20 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.95 billion or 15.6% of revenue, and was nearly flat in dollars  year-over-year as investments in future growth initiatives and lower vendor funding being recorded as an offset to SG&A were offset by the flow of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions and lower incentive compensation.
From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.
International non-GAAP SG&A was $192 million or 17.2% of revenue, a decrease of $70 million or 10 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
Specific to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred non-GAAP diluted EPS impact of negative $0.03 in the fourth quarter and negative $0.07 for fiscal 2016. These impacts were lower than expected due to higher sales retention from closed stores, a more disciplined promotional strategy and our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year in order to pilot results.
In Q1 of fiscal '17, Canada will still be lapping 68 of its store closures last year, and facing ongoing foreign currency and Canadian economic headwinds. As such, in Q1, we expect International revenues to decline 15% to 20%. 
Beginning in the second quarter and through the balance of the year, while currency and economic headwinds will continue to be a challenge, in constant currency, the International business is expected to be near flat on both the top and bottom line.
From a cash flow perspective, on a full year basis, capital expenditures totaled $649 million, and we returned $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders. 
In working capital, our decision to bring holiday inventory in early as well as a Super Bowl moving into Q1 fiscal '17 resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year-end. This created a timing issue, which resulted in our ratio of accounts payable to inventory being lower at year end than last year. As we look forward to next year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of  $650 million to $700 million, and the accounts payable to inventory ratio is expected to increase.
I would now like to talk about our Q1 financial guidance. In the Domestic business, we believe that the softness that we saw in the NPD tracked categories and mobile phones will continue into Q1. We also believe that in the International business, revenue will be down by approximately 15% to 20% due to the ongoing impacts of foreign currency and the Canadian brand consolidation which was not executed until late March of 2015.  With that backdrop, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.35 billion, and Enterprise comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%, primarily driven by continued softness in the mobile and tablet categories.
Our non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 39% to 39.5%, and our Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 326 million.

So talking about the future in this industry is always interesting and let me try to be as helpful as possible. As we look ahead in particular, fiscal '17, the areas where we see key growth opportunities for us, around appliances, where we, as you know, we've had multiple quarters, multiple years now of growth, and that's going to continue to be driven by the housing recovery. Second is connected objects, so around the connected -- the Internet of Things, Connected Home, and then of course, there's the continued TV cycle. The specific categories you talk about, so in particular order, virtual reality, we are very excited. We have this promotion, if anybody is interested in buying the Galaxy S7, you can preorder now at Best Buy, and you get a free virtual reality gear, and then some additional memory, so great value. Candidly, this is an interesting category. I think it will still be small this year. It may help in the computing category with higher-end computers, because you're going to need that computing power.
But it's from a financial standpoint, it's going to be limited. Mobile, I think I'm going to stick to my prepared remarks. It's going to be a function of new products revising the category. And I'm not going to make any forward-looking statement on that particular point. TV is, of course, we've been very excited and performing really well with 4K and large-screen TVs. Our share has been increasing. Of course, like any cycle, this is not going to continue forever, so it's not going to be as strong going forward as it has been from a growth rate standpoint. Connected Home, I think is an exciting category. Increasingly, it's not just about the security cameras or the smart locks and so forth. Everything in your home is connected, at least in my home. Your smart TV is connected. Your music, your streaming, your home office is connected, gaming is connected. And of course, getting into security, home automation, energy management. And the complexity of this -- if you think about this, with the control layer, the security layer, the networking layer, the access layer, provides a lot of complexity. And so the continued innovation and the complexity creates a big opportunity for us. So we're seeing growth amid comments about the fact that we are increasing the assortments, the presentation and we're building on our strength in routers and networking. So we'll see continued growth in that growth space of connected objects and the Internet of Things."

But rest assured that we will continue to rationalize as we deem it appropriate. The great news is that the stores that remain in our portfolio, they are performing. The key for us is improving and increasing our retention rates in the U.S. Unlike Canada where the stores were literally in the same parking lot, a mile away, 3 miles away, in the U.S., we never built our portfolio that way.

The services revenue decline, there's a piece which we've called nonproductive revenue, which is the -- which is driven by the lower frequency and cost severity related to the clients. As related to the productive revenue, which is the one that we care about, the trend is starting to evolve because we have the price investment, and we have quantified it for you in Q4 and that's going to, of course, carry over into this fiscal year. And it is partially offset by the -- we're seeing -- beginning of an increase in the attach rates. We never expected it -- expected the attach rates to fully offset the price investment. This is an area, frankly, where the elasticity is much lower than on the key hardware categories. But we thought it was the right thing to do from a customers' standpoint as we looked ahead. As related to the periodic payment from the warranty portfolio, last year was an exceptional year. And we've disclosed every quarter, the amounts. It was driven by again, the improved performance of our service portfolio, so nothing to be shy about around that. But this was an exceptional year because it was multiple -- it was twice the amounts. Now looking ahead in this fiscal year, we'll get some continued improvement in that business as the improved operational performance, severity and frequency, will carry over -- not so much in the form of periodic payments, but in the form of lower cost charged to the portfolio, not nearly close to the amount of fiscal '16, but some portion. Now what's exciting for us is that we get to lap the party exceptional payment last year, and we're able to do this through the increased focus on cost and efficiency."

We did bring our inventories in earlier, and customers are shopping earlier and earlier. So that in retrospect, has turned out to be an excellent decision for us. In addition to that, we have had a significant focus on restocking in our stores, and have made some operational changes in our stores for down stocking. That also paid dividends to us during the fourth quarter. In addition, on ship-from-store, we continue to believe that strategically ship-from-store will be a go bound in our history at Best Buy as one of the most important strategic decisions that we made because it is allowing us to utilize both our online and our retail inventories to serve the online customer. And it has -- obviously, you've seen the strength of our online growth. You know that business now is over $4 billion.

We are pleased with the minds and the spirit of the U.S. consumer, certainly compared to many other geographies outside of the U.S. Demand is there. You see it when you see the growth in appliances, continued growth in appliances, that is a very strong wave. In our category, I think we all have to bear in mind that demand is driven by supply. So when there's great exciting innovation, you get that because most of what we sell is not a basic Maslovian need on the part of our customer. So this is an industry where great supply creates demand. And we're excited by the technology wave that are coming above and beyond the softness that has existed in phones. From a services standpoint, I would say 2 things: One is, there's clear demand for help on the part of the customer. Now the customer, all of us, don't always want to pay for service. And we will provide and we're providing service today in order to generate more demand. So when we have Magnolia system designers coming to your home, that's going to generate demand, but their visit is free, and we're happy to come to your home. Everybody on the call will come to you. Tech-support, however, above and beyond the sales help, is something that customers are happy to pay for, and we are seeing increased demand in this area. So we -- the summary is that we believe we have an opportunity rich environment, and that the key trend made for Best Buy based on these technology waves and the need that customers have for help."

Looking ahead, there's no doubt that in terms of physical shop-in-shop, there's less to be done, right, because we have high penetration of these shop-in-shops.

So as we start developing those plans and may become more crystallized, we will definitely be communicating that. What we wanted to make sure that you guys took away from today's call is that, that $400 million is the bottom of what we believe is possible, and that with these additional opportunities that we've been identifying in the back half of this year, that we continue to believe that there is substantially more opportunity there. So we'll keep you posted as we go. Let's get the $400 million delivered as well, and then we can talk about more. But there is no doubt that based on some of the looking we're doing and you guys, these are very structural, and they're going to come through the product flow and how it comes through Best Buy, it's going to come through our return process, especially on large cube inventory, there is so much opportunity there. There is recovery on inventory that is returned. It's how we handle the movement across the United States with some of our larger cube inventory. This comes in many forms. The great news is it comes in many forms. And it is -- there is no lack of opportunity. And I'm going to take 1 more-minute just to lay a backdrop for why is there this much opportunity at Best Buy. The reason we have these opportunities is because if you think about the growth years for Best Buy, they were opening 50 stores a year and adding $1 billion to $2 billion a year of incremental revenue. And during that time, when you have that kind of growth, trying to keep pace with all of the operational excellence that goes behind that, what you end up doing is creating a large number of triage processes, meaning that while we don't have the systems to do this, so we're going to create this workaround and it will work. And then the work around gets bigger and bigger and bigger as the company continues to grow. But just about the time they get ready to fix it, they've just added another 50 stores and another $2 billion worth of revenue and of course, that was the focus back then. Now that the company has reached such scale, these opportunities, these workarounds have become very costly. And thus the opportunity that we have to take them out. But leave it to understand that they are structural, and a lot of change has to happen. And that's why you don't just throw them out there on a list and say, yep, I totally -- I got to be communicating that, we need to give you guys clarity to the road map."

I will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and annual performance, and then provide an overview of the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. We will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.
From a financial perspective, in the first quarter, we delivered Enterprise revenue of $13.62 billion, improved our non-GAAP operating income rate by 10 basis points to 5.9%, and delivered a better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.53 versus $1.48 last year. In our Domestic business, we exceeded our bottom line expectations due to a well-executed holiday plan, a disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returns and clearance product, and strong expense management. 
While Domestic revenue declined 1.5%, it was against a backdrop where the NPD reported categories were down 5.1%. Strong performance in health and wearables, home theater and appliances was more than offset by softness in the mobile phone category and continued declines in tablets. In addition, we continue to drive significant growth in the online channel with e-commerce revenue increasing nearly 14% to 15.6% of total Domestic revenue. In the International business, our performance was better than expected on the top and bottom lines, while revenue declined 26.2% due to the expected impacts of foreign currency and store closures in Canada. Revenue retention from the brand consolidation continued to exceed our expectations. This high retention, in addition to a more effective promotional strategy, drove a 30-basis-point increase in the International non-GAAP operating income rate to 4.7%. 
On a full year basis, fiscal 2016 marks the second year in a row we increased our Domestic revenue and expanded our operating margin. We also continued to make significant progress against our Renew Blue strategy. So during the year, we continued to gain share in appliances and nearly all of our traditional consumer electronics categories. We grew Domestic online revenue 13% to over $4 billion or 11% of total Domestic revenue. We increased our Net Promoter Score by over 300 basis points. We continue to improve our employee engagement scores and decreased employee turnover. We deepened our partnerships with the top tech companies in the world. We delivered $150 million against our $400 million Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program. We consolidated brands and embarked on a significant transformation in Canada, including the closure of 68 stores. And finally, in 1 year, we returned $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders, including $1 billion in share repurchases, which was originally planned to be completed over 3 years.
This performance is the direct result of the execution of our Renew Blue strategy and the hard work, dedication and customer focus on the part of all of our associates. I am proud to recognize them publicly this morning.
Turning to fiscal 2017. We are entering the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. Our purpose from a customers' standpoint is to build a company that does a unique job of helping customers learn about and enjoy the latest technology. As we begin this next phase, in fiscal 2017, we will execute against the following priorities: Number one, build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business; number two, drive cost reduction and efficiencies; and number 3, advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation.
So our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business, more specifically, we will implement a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital towards services and supply chain. For example, in home theater, we will build on the superior customer experience we've created in partnership with our key vendors, and leverage the strength of our market-leading share in 4K and large-screen televisions. We will also add 5 Magnolia Design Centers stores-within-a-store, bringing our total to 84 by year end. 
In appliances, we expect to continue to grow our market share by adding an incremental 27 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store, bringing our total to 203 at year-end, and by leveraging the new vendor appliance experiences that were launched in Q3 of last year.  Additionally, we expect to see incremental growth from our enhanced delivery and installation offerings, which are driving high conversion and material improvements in NPS, Net Promoter Score.
In Connected Home, we will continue to increase our assortment in emerging categories, including security, lighting and video monitoring, expand our in-store presentation, and leverage our leading position in routers and networking equipment which form the backbone of the Connected Home.
In mobile phones, we will capitalize on the customer experience investments we implemented late last year, with an expectation to drive increased conversion as well as reduce wait time for our customers. Our strategy is to be an advocate for every phone order by offering the best deal on plans and devices, impartial advice, and clarity and efficiency in what can be a complex process. In the very short time, we believe high smartphone penetration, combined with low consumer demand for current product offerings, is depressing the category. Over the course of the year, we believe that more compelling phone launches can fuel renewed growth in the category.
From an online standpoint, we will continue to build out new digital capabilities, prioritizing the customer shopping experience on phone and tablet devices. Examples of recent advances include the successful Q4 launch of Blue Assist, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call and e-mail. Another example is Touch ID login, included in our latest mobile app update, and of course, our recently launched Geek Squad app.
In our retail stores, we will continue to drive increased sales proficiency and further leverage our service capabilities. In fiscal 2016, our Blue Shirt and Geek Squad agents contributed significantly to our NPS and market share gains, and we believe there continues to be significant further opportunity to take this competitive advantage to the next level. And finally, in our International business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation. We'll continue to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance.
Our second priority for fiscal 2017 is to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing costs is essential for us to be able to fund our investment, build our resilience to product cycles, and increase our profitability over time. Furthermore, based on the -- on current economic factors and softness in the consumer electronics industry, it is essential that we be proactive on the cost reduction front.  A key element of our approach to achieving this is to simplify our business processes to simultaneously improve the customer experience and drive cost out.  As an example, we have a project focused on reducing the amount of open box appliances we take into our stores by addressing root cause issues. This project has the potential to not only improve the customer experience, but also to drive material savings through lower markdowns, lower transportation costs, and better use of labor in our stores and distributions centers. 
More broadly, we aspire to achieve world-class operational levels of performance, defined in terms of quality, service and cost. This focus has to be a way of life, especially given our margin structure and the volatility of our industry. Last year, we announced a specific cost reduction and gross profit optimization program called Renew Blue Phase 2, with the goal of $400 million over 3 years, on top of the $1 billion we eliminated as part of Phase 1. Against that goal, in the fiscal 2016, we achieved $150 million, leaving us with $250 million. 
In light of our increased focus on cost and productivity, we believe there are incremental savings that can be achieved above and beyond our current goal which we will update you on as we progress.  Partially offsetting these savings will be our expected future investments in the areas of labor expertise, services pricing and key growth initiatives, which I will discuss in a moment.  In fiscal 2016, these investments total approximately $100 million, and we expect a similar level in fiscal 2017 which to be clear, will be funded by our cost savings.
Our third priority is to advance key initiatives to more deeply transform Best Buy in order to drive future growth and differentiation. While they may be short and precious, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity-rich environment. The advent of the Internet of Things is providing a new technology wave and is making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant to customers. We are investing to be the leading technology expert, which makes it easy to learn about and confidently enjoy the Best Tech. 
In this context, we believe we have ongoing growth opportunities around key product categories as well as from increasing our share of wallet with existing customers, and acquiring new customers within our target segments for those of us passionate about technology and need help with it. Capturing these opportunities, will require that we do the following: Number one, develop and bring to market curated solution-driven merchandise to solve key customer problems, in particular, in new growth areas and; number two, ensure we have an inspirational and educational sales approach across all sales channels that helps customers understand the value that technology can create for them; number three, help customers unleash what's possible from their technology; and number four, provide customers with ongoing convenient purchase support.  Inherent in all of this is the desire to build a stronger ongoing relationship with our customers.
Now our services capabilities in Geek Squad are key building blocks of this strategy. We understand that we've discussed service-related opportunities many times in the past. And while it is not visible in our services top line results today, we are, in fact, making progress to bring these opportunities to life. To do so, we've had to spend time in the last 2 years fixing many aspects of our traditional warranty and repair businesses. We've also had to adjust our pricing in warranty business. We are seeing the results of our efforts through substantial increases in Net Promoter Scores, higher total customer interactions and from a financial point of view, the periodic profit-sharing payments we earned this year.  We are also beginning to see improved attach rates as we enter fiscal 2017.
Building on this, we will continue our work to improve the customer experience and enhance our service offering and capabilities in support of our mission to help customers learn about and enjoy the latest tech. While we are energized by the potential of this opportunity, the work necessary to capture it, it takes time. Thus, fiscal 2017 will be another year of gradual incremental improvement, with more meaningful results expected in fiscal 2018.
Now before I turn the call over to Sharon, I'd like to provide some thoughts about our fiscal 2017 outlook and return of capital plan. So in summary, Best Buy is a specialty retailer that excels in an industry characterized by product innovation cycles. We are undeterred by this fact, as we believe there will always be technology innovation, and our imperative is that in these cycles we continue to deliver superior execution against what is in our control recognizing that the cycles rarely align at any point in time.
In fiscal 2017, we are focused on continuing to build on our foundation to both drive and capitalize on these technology cycles. In parallel, we are focused on building the key initiatives that we discussed today that we believe will result in stickier relationship with our customers, provide profitable revenue even during down cycles, and continue to create long-term shareholder value. Over time as the fruits of these key initiatives materialize, we expect to accelerate our revenue and operating income growth by taking advantage of opportunities provided by ongoing technology innovation and the need customers have for help. In the short term, we will be characterized by our strong cash flow generating capabilities and our intent to regularly return excess free cash flow to shareholders. 
From a financial outlook perspective for fiscal 2017, based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out in our Domestic business, we are expecting revenue declines in the first half followed by growth in the back half. We also expect that our strong execution and operational capabilities will allow us to continue to gain market share. In this context, we are targeting flat Domestic revenue for the full year due to continued growth in appliances, Connected Home and home theater, in particular, but recognize that being flat will be challenging without a strong mobile cycle, and improvements in the NPD reported categories overall. 
Despite the soft line -- the soft top line environment, we will target flattish operating income, including the lapping of the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. In addition, we intend to reward our shareholders by being a premium dividend payer, and increasing our earnings per share through ongoing share repurchases. 
I would now like to talk about our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan. After 3 consecutive years of strong cash flow generation under Renew Blue, we believe that now is an ideal time to provide a view of our long-term capital allocation strategy. This strategy is based on our strong cash position today and our ongoing confidence in our future cash flow generation. At the core of this strategy is our intent to: First, fund our operations and growth investments, including potential acquisitions; and then to return the remaining excess free cash flow to our shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy targets the return of excess free cash flow to shareholders through a 35% to 45% non-GAAP dividend payout ratio, and regular share repurchases with the minimum annual expectation of offsetting dilution from equity compensation.
So in line with this strategy, our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan includes: Number one, the 22% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share; number two, the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next 2 years; and number three, a special dividend of $0.45 per share or approximately $145 million. This is in addition to the $1.5 billion in cash we returned to shareholders in fiscal 2016. 
I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our Q1 fiscal '17 guidance."
255397,324046206,940770,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release.Enterprise revenue of $13.6 billion w",1136,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release.
Enterprise revenue of $13.6 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.9%, however, exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected profitability in both our Domestic and International businesses driven by a more affective, disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returned and clearance products, and an approximate $0.02 of additionally EPS from the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio. Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 34%, resulting in an incremental $0.02 of EPS versus expectations. 
I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue declined 4.1% to $13.6 billion, primarily due to a 1.8% comparable sales decline in the Domestic business, and negative foreign currency impact of approximately 140 basis points, and the negative impact of Canadian store closures.  Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.05 or 3% to $1.53. This increase was primarily driven by the service periodic profit-sharing benefit of $0.19, and a share repurchase benefit of $0.06. These benefits were partially offset by Domestic revenue declines in the mobile phone, tablet and digital imaging categories and the expected $0.03 negative impact from the Canadian brand consolidation.
In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 1.5% to $12.5 billion. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.8%, excluding the estimated 10 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and the loss of revenue from 13 large format and 17 small format Best Buy mobile store closures. These declines were partially offset by the 10-basis-point benefit associated with installment billing and the approximate 80 basis point services periodic profit-sharing benefits, which is not included in our comparable sales calculation.
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by significant declines in mobile phones, tablets, digital imaging and services.  In services, comparable revenue declined 11.9% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven by lower frequency and severity of claims on extended warranties. In our International segment, revenue declined 26.2% to $1.1 billion due to a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points, the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry.
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 21.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 21.6%. This increase was primarily due to a 65-basis-point impact from the services periodic profit-sharing benefit and improved rates in the mobile and computing categories, primarily due to a more disciplined promotional strategy. These increases were partially offset by an increased mix of lower margin wearable devices, a decreased mix of higher-margin digital imaging products, a lower rate in televisions driven by a decline in average selling prices and higher distribution costs and our investments in services pricing. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 21.8%. This increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year gross profit rates in both Canada and Mexico due to a more disciplined promotional strategy.
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.1 billion or 15.7% of revenue, a decrease of $68 million, but an increase of 20 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.95 billion or 15.6% of revenue, and was nearly flat in dollars  year-over-year as investments in future growth initiatives and lower vendor funding being recorded as an offset to SG&A were offset by the flow of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions and lower incentive compensation. From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.
International non-GAAP SG&A was $192 million or 17.2% of revenue, a decrease of $70 million or 10 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates.  Specific to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred non-GAAP diluted EPS impacts of negative $0.03 in the fourth quarter and negative $0.07 for fiscal 2016. These impacts were lower than expected due to higher sales retention from closed stores, a more disciplined promotional strategy and our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year in order to pilot results.
In Q1 of fiscal '17, Canada will still be lapping 68 of its store closures last year, and facing ongoing foreign currency and Canadian economic headwinds. As such, in Q1, we expect International revenues to decline 15% to 20%.  Beginning in the second quarter and through the balance of the year, while currency and economic headwinds will continue to be a challenge, in constant currency, the International business is expected to be near flat on both the top and bottom line. From a cash flow perspective, on a full year basis, capital expenditures totaled $649 million, and we returned $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders. 
In working capital, our decision to bring holiday inventory in early as well as the Super Bowl moving into Q1 fiscal '17 resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year-end. This created a timing issue, which resulted in our ratio of accounts payable to inventory being lower at year end than last year. As we look forward to next year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million, and the accounts payable to inventory ratio is expected to increase.
I would now like to talk about our Q1 financial guidance. In the Domestic business, we believe that the softness that we saw in the NPD tracked categories and mobile phones will continue into Q1. We also believe that in the International business, revenue will be down the approximate 15% to 20% due to the ongoing impacts of foreign currency and the Canadian brand consolidation which was not executed until late March of 2015.  With that backdrop, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.35 billion, and Enterprise comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%, primarily driven by continued softness in the mobile and tablet categories.
Our non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 39% to 39.5%, and our Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 326 million.
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So talking about the future in this industry is always interesting and let me try to be as helpful as possible. As we look ahead in particular, fiscal '17, the areas where we see key growth opportunities for us, around appliances, where we, as you know, we've had multiple quarters, multiple years now of growth, and that's going to continue to be driven by the housing recovery. Second is connected objects, so around the connected -- the Internet of Things, Connected Home, and then of course, there's the continued TV cycle. The specific categories you talk about, so in particular order, virtual reality, we are very excited. We have this promotion, if anybody is interested in buying the Galaxy S7, you can preorder now at Best Buy, and you get a free virtual reality gear, and then some additional memory, so great value. Candidly, this is an interesting category. I think it will still be small this year. It may help in the computing category with higher-end computers, because you're going to need that computing power. But it's from a financial standpoint, it's going to be limited. Mobile, I think I'm going to stick to my prepared remarks. It's going to be a function of new products revising the category. And I'm not going to make any forward-looking statement on that particular point. TVs, of course, we've been very excited and performing really well with 4K and large-screen TVs. Our share has been increasing. Of course, like any cycle, this is not going to continue forever, so it's not going to be as strong going forward as it has been from a growth rate standpoint. Connected Home, I think is an exciting category. Increasingly, it's not just about the security cameras or the smart locks and so forth. Everything in your home is connected, at least in my home. Your smart TVs is connected. Your music, your streaming, your home office is connected, gaming is connected. And of course, getting into security, home automation, energy management. And the complexity of this, think about this, with the control layer, the security layer, the networking layer, the access layer, provides a lot of complexity. And so the continued innovation and the complexity creates a big opportunity for us. So we're seeing growth amid comments about the fact that we are increasing the assortments, the presentation and we're building on our strength in routers and networking. So we'll see continued growth in that growth space of connected objects and the Internet of Things."

In addition to that, the Canadian economy also has been pretty soft. And we are playing that into our outlook, and making sure that we've accounted for what we think is happening there right now. But we could not be more pleased with the consolidation, the retention rates, the execution that has happened up there. And also lastly, there will also be some additional investments next year. But remember, we're saying we're offsetting our investments as a company, but there will be some investments in these new pilot stores that we are working on. And there's disruption when we're approaching that. So that will be another aspect of it. We're not going to be announcing every quarter an impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and these stores. We're going to treat it pretty much as business as usual. But there is significant investment, and it is why the CapEx mix here is going up just slightly because that will be higher in Canada."

But rest assured that we will continue to rationalize as we deem it appropriate. The great news is that the stores that remain in our portfolio, they are performing.

The services revenue decline, there's a piece which we've called nonproductive revenue, which is the -- which is driven by the lower frequency and cost severity related to the clients. As related to the productive revenue, which",299,"Yes. So several questions. The services revenue decline, there's a piece which we've called nonproductive revenue, which is the -- which is driven by the lower frequency and cost severity related to the clients. As related to the productive revenue, which is the one that we care about, the trend is starting to evolve because we have the price investment, and we have quantified it for you in Q4 and that is going to, of course, carry over into this fiscal year. And it is partially offset by the -- we're seeing the beginning of an increase in the attach rates. We never expected it -- expected the attach rates to fully offset the price investment. This is an area, frankly, where the elasticity is much lower than on the key hardware categories. But we thought it was the right thing to do from a customer standpoint as we looked ahead. As related to the periodic payment from the warranty portfolio, last year was an exceptional year. And we've disclosed every quarter, the amounts. It was driven by again, the improved performance of our service portfolio, so nothing to be shy about around that. But this was an exceptional year because it was multiple -- it was twice the amounts. Now looking ahead in this fiscal year, we'll get some continued improvement in that business as the improved operational performance, severity and frequency, will carry over, not so much in the form of periodic payments, but in the form of lower cost charged to the portfolio, not nearly close to the amount of fiscal '16, but some portion. Now what's exciting for us is that we get to lap the party exceptional payment last year, and we're able to do this through the increased focus on cost and efficiency."

Yes, there is no question that we improved our in-stock levels and what is terrific is that our customers noticed it. This was an area where we received recognition in our Net Promoter Score from our customers. Now in order to do that, you heard me just mention this accounts payable to inventory ratio. We did bring our inventories in earlier, and customers are shopping earlier and earlier. So that, in retrospect, has turned out to be an excellent decision for us. In addition to that, we have had a significant focus on restocking in our stores, and have made some operational changes in our stores for down stocking. That also paid dividends to us during the fourth quarter. In addition, on ship-from-store, we continue to believe that strategically ship-from-store will be a go bound in our history at Best Buy as one of the most important strategic decisions that we made because it is allowing us to utilize both our online and our retail inventories to serve the online customer. And it has -- obviously, you've seen the strength of our online growth. You know that business now is over $4 billion. And what ship-from-store is allowing us to do is be able to, on a consistent basis, make marketing promises to customers about speed of delivery. So to your question on, we said we were going to do this, was there a positive outcome? Clearly, there was a balance sheet investment as it related to that accounts payable, the inventory ratio, the answer is yes, we did it. It worked and we're very pleased with it, and we will continue to make additional changes where we believe it's necessary. But Hubert and I, in no way believe that we have solved our in-stock issue."

So when there's great exciting innovation, you get that because most of what we sell is not a basic Maslovian need on the part of our customer. So this is an industry where great supply creates demand. And we're excited by the technology waves that are coming above and beyond the softness that has existed in phones. From a services standpoint, I would say 2 things: One is, there's clear demand for help on the part of the customer. Now the customer, all of us, don't always want to pay for service. And we will provide and we're providing service today in order to generate more demand. So when we have Magnolia system designers coming to your home, that's going to generate demand, but their visit is free, and we're happy to come to your home. Everybody on the call will come to you.

So as we start developing those plans and may become more crystallized, we will definitely be communicating that. What we wanted to make sure that you guys took away from today's call is that, that $400 million is the bottom of what we believe is possible, and that with these additional opportunities that we've been identifying in the back half of this year, that we continue to believe that there is substantially more opportunity there. So we'll keep you posted as we go. Let's get the $400 million delivered as well, and then we can talk about more. But there is no doubt that based on some of the looking we're doing and you guys, these are very structural, and they're going to come through the product flow and how it comes through Best Buy, it's going to come through our return process, especially on large cube inventory, there's so much opportunity there. There is recovery on inventory that is returned. It's how we handle the movement across the United States with some of our larger cube inventory. This comes in many forms. The great news is it comes in many forms. And it is -- there is no lack of opportunity. And I'm going to take 1 more-minute just to lay a backdrop for why is there this much opportunity at Best Buy. The reason we have these opportunities is because if you think about the growth years for Best Buy, they were opening 50 stores a year and adding $1 billion to $2 billion a year of incremental revenue. And during that time, when you have that kind of growth, trying to keep pace with all of the operational excellence that goes behind that, what you end up doing is creating a large number of triage processes, meaning that while we don't have the systems to do this, so we're going to create this workaround and it will work. And then the work around gets bigger and bigger and bigger as the company continues to grow. But just about the time they get ready to fix it, they've just added another 50 stores and another $2 billion worth of revenue and of course, that was the focus back then. Now that the company has reached such scale, these opportunities, these workarounds have become very costly. And thus the opportunity that we have to take them out. But leave it to understand that they are structural, and a lot of change has to happen. And that's why you don't just throw them out there on a list and say, yep, I totally am going to be communicating that, we need to give you guys clarity to the road map."

Let me begin by discussing the announcement we made today regarding Sharon McCollam and Corie Barry. Of course, I first want to thank Sharon for the profound and lasting impact she's had on Best Buy and our amazing partnership. As you all know, Sharon came out of retirement in 2012 to help revitalize Best Buy when the company was facing a multifaceted crisis. 3.5 years later, we are in a very different place and are [ph] into the next phase of our journey as a company. And so as she transitions out of her role, Sharon can look forward to spending more time with her husband with a sense of accomplishment and confidence in Best Buy's future. 
Now one of Sharon's legacies is her successor in the CFO role, Corie Barry. Corie is a 16-year veteran of Best Buy and our current Chief Strategic Growth Officer. She's been groomed by Sharon for the CFO role almost since the time Sharon joined the company, and the 2 have collaborated on succession planning with the goal of making this a seamless transition. Over her many years at Best Buy, Corie has had a number of operational and financial roles in the field and at the corporate level, including as Senior Vice President of U.S. Finance and as the interim head of our services business. The board, Sharon and I firmly believe that Corie has the kind of experience, skills and passion for Best Buy that make for the perfect choice for this position. I look forward to working with her in her new role. 
Sharon will remain as CFO until our Annual Shareholder Meeting on June 14, at which time Corie will assume her responsibilities. As part of this transition plan, Sharon will remain with Best Buy in an advisory role until the end of the fiscal year. The duties Sharon has as Chief Administrative Officer will be assumed by several members of our executive team. So let me say once again how grateful we are to Sharon for all that she has done. Her legacy will endure. To Corie, allow me to publicly extend my congratulations. She's been a key player in Best Buy [ph] resurgence, and I'm confident she'll be a great leader for our company in the years ahead.
Altogether, I feel this is a remarkable time for our company. We have an exciting set of assets and opportunities and a very strong team committed to creating great results for all our stakeholders. 
I will now provide an overview of our first quarter performance and an update on our progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities, and I will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details in our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.
In the first quarter, we delivered better-than-expected Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion, a 30 basis point improvement in our non-GAAP operating income rate to 2.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.37 last year. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered better-than-expected, essentially flat comparable sales versus our guidance of a 1% to 2% decline. Contributing to these better-than-expected results was the strong performance in our online channel, which grew 24% in the quarter. And similar to last quarter's strength/trends [ph] from a merchandising perspective, we saw strong year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, offset by continued softness in mobile phones and tablets. 
Industry sales in the NPD-reported categories, which don't reflect mobile phone and appliance sales, declined 1.9%, including the benefit of the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 fiscal 2017. We also saw significant gains in our Net Promoter Score, which improved more than 600 basis points compared to this time last year, more than 600 basis points. 
In our International business, strong execution and higher sales retention in our Canadian business drove a better-than-expected revenue decline of 1.2% on a constant currency basis despite closing approximately 1/3 or 66 of our large format stores on March 28 of last year. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% versus our guidance of a 15% to 20% decline, primarily due to a lower-than-expected negative impact from foreign currency and the higher sales retention we are seeing in Canada. So altogether, a strong quarter, and I want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering these results. 
Now I'd like to share highlights of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. As we discussed on our Q4 call, our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. This involves implementing a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital, stores, supply chain, services and customer care. 
In appliances, we leveraged our 176 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver a 14% increase in revenue and our 22nd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. As a reminder, we will continue to roll out incremental stores-within-a-store throughout the year. 
In home theater, our market-leading customer experience around 4K and large-screen technologies continue to drive sales growth and market share gains. To continue to build on this experience, we're rolling out 376 new LG experiences in addition to our existing Sony and Samsung experiences. In computing, similar to home theater, our partnership with key vendors and the strengths of our market-leading position have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. 
In mobile, we added 25 incremental Verizon and AT&T stores-within-a-store to the 250 we rolled out in the back half of last year. However, the mobile phone category remains challenging as industry demand continues to be soft. Despite this current softness, we continue to believe that over the course of the year, iconic new phone launches can drive renewed growth in this category. 
In our online business, our 24% sales growth was driven by continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dotcom capabilities, including faster shipping. We continue to focus on improving the shopping journey for our customers, including streamlining the checkout process, providing visibility earlier in the shopping funnel for local store product availability, improving the quality and relevance of product recommendations and increasing search relevancy and accuracy. 
In our retail stores, the level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to drive meaningful improvement in our Net Promoter Score among both purchasers and nonpurchasers and is contributing to our market share gains. In our services business, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increase our Net Promoter Score. 
Year-over-year, our Geek Squad agents also drove more customer interactions across our channels and helped more customers use and enjoy their technology products. As expected, overall services revenue declined during the quarter, due to the carryover effect of the pricing investments we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair [ph] revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims in our extended warranties. 
As a reminder, while at face value, this repair revenue decline appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial because it reflects a reduction of our extended warranty costs. In our international business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation. As reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. 
Looking ahead, our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that is enabled by the consolidation of the 2 brands. 
Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing costs is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. This work is well on its way. I want to stress that this is not an isolated short-term cost-reduction program. We're establishing a lean culture focused on systematically eliminating nonquality and defects. This approach requires collaboration across teams and functions, and we're building the organizational capability, mindset and habits necessary to sustain changes. 
As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the first quarter, bringing our current achievements to $200 million. 
The third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short pressures, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity-rich environment. We're investing to make it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. 
We see fiscal '17 as a year of exploration and experimentation around creating compelling customer experiences that have the potential to unlock growth. Throughout the year, we will be testing and piloting several concepts around the country, and with our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
So to recap, we delivered a strong first quarter and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 full year financial outlook that we provided in our Q4 call. That outlook includes approximately flat revenue and non-GAAP operating income with EPS growth driven by share repurchases. 
Although we're reporting better-than-expected results today, we're not raising our full year outlook as the first quarter represents less than 15% of full year earnings. And at this stage, we have no new material information as it relates to product launches throughout the year. 
And now and of course, it's a bit emotional, let me turn the call over to my friend, Sharon McCollam. Sharon, anything you want to share with us this morning?"

Thank you. While I remain in an advisory capacity through the end of the year, this is my last official call as CFO, and as such, I want to take this opportunity to express what an immense privilege it has been to be part of this incredible transformation[ph]. With our team of more than 125,000 people, we have worked hand in hand to Renew Blue. And today, as I prepare to step down from my current role to spend more time with my husband and my family, I do so knowing that we have never been as well positioned as we are today to take Best Buy to a new level. 
I'd like to thank my peers, our corporate and field teams and, in particular, my direct reports for their exceptional contribution that have made this possible. I would also like to thank our board and you, our shareholders and analysts, for your confidence and support [ph]. 
Additionally, I want to publicly congratulate Corie. Corie has been my strategic right-hand partner since I joined Best Buy. With her exceptional financial acumen and deep understanding of Best Buy's operations, she has been an influential leader over the financial and cost discipline that have been established across the company over the past several years. She is also a highly respected cross-functional leader and will be an incredible CFO, of whom I could not be more proud or confident. So congratulations, Corie. 
And of course, I want to thank Hubert. You're an extraordinary leader and an inspiring business partner and a friend. I will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to share this journey with you and our entire Best Buy family."

Okay, so now let's talk about our Q1 results. Before I talk about these results versus last year, I'd like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you on our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our exp",1021,"Thank you, Hubert. Okay, so now let's talk about our Q1 results. 
Before I talk about these results versus last year, I'd like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you on our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our expectations, driven equally by the outperformance of our Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the flow-through of higher revenue. Additionally, a lower effective income tax rate contributed to an incremental $0.01 of EPS versus our expectations. 
I will now talk about our Q1 results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, Enterprise revenue declined 0.8% to $8.44 billion, primarily due to the impact of Domestic and Canadian store closures. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue declined 1.3%, reflecting approximately 55 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 19% to $0.44. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year and a $0.04 per share benefit from share repurchases. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of lower revenue in the Domestic segment and a higher non-GAAP effective income tax rate. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased a less-than-expected 0.8% to $7.8 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by the loss of revenue from 13 large format and 24 Best Buy Mobile store closures. Comparable sales were essentially flat. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones, tablets and gaming. As expected, television sales related to the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 '17 positively impacted the Domestic segment by approximately 70 basis points. 
In services, comparable revenue declined 10.7% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.9% to $832 million, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 210 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.5% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.2% to $614 million due primarily to closed stores in Canada. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 8.1%, reflecting approximately 690 basis points of negative foreign currency impacts. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23%, primarily due to a prior year reserve on non-iconic phone inventory, which did not recur this year and improved rates, primarily driven by our more disciplined promotional strategy across product categories. These increases were partially offset by our investment in service pricing. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as we lapped [ph] the significant disruption and corresponding increase promotional activity related to the brand consolidation in Q1 fiscal '16, and we received a higher periodic profit sharing payment in our services business. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or flat on a rate basis. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.56 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which was flat year-over-year as investments in the business were offset by the flow-through of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. 
From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $156 million or 25.4% of revenue, a decrease of $23 million or 140 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
I'll now discuss our fiscal 2017 and Q2 '17 outlook. As Hubert said, from a financial outlook perspective, we are reaffirming our expectations of approximately flat revenue and flat non-GAAP operating income for the full year, including lapping the significant periodic profit sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal '16. A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. Based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out, we are expecting slight declines in revenue in the first half followed by growth in the back half. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize this will be challenging without a stronger mobile cycle and improvements in the NPD-reported categories overall. I would now like to talk about our Q2 financial guidance. For Q2, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, and both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales of approximately flat. We expect International revenues to decline approximately 5% to 10% on a reported basis but to be flat on a constant currency basis. 
We expect our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 325 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 36% to 36.5%. In line with our original expectations, there are 2 factors impacting our Q2 year-over-year non-GAAP EPS guidance. 
First, we are expecting an approximate $0.03 net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic service profit sharing payment from our services plan portfolio that we received in the second quarter of last year. 
Second, we are expecting an approximate $0.06 negative impact from the carryover of last September's services pricing investment. In addition, in digital imaging, we are now expecting an approximate $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact due to the April 2016 earthquake in Japan, which is impacting inventory availability in this high-margin category. 
Combined, these are putting $0.12 to $0.13 of pressure on Q2 fiscal '17, which will be partially offset by approximate $0.04 benefit from share repurchases. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

The -- we think of the company as a company that is there to provide a great experience for the customer across all channels. And increasingly, it will be difficult to measure the contribution of each channel because again, and you guys all know this, the shopping journey starts online, may then be completed online or in the stores. There's a journey to the store. If you're going to buy a 4K TV, the only way to see the quality of the picture and ask questions is really in the store, but then the transaction may be completed in the store or online. So our overall goal as a company, frankly, is to accelerate the total revenue growth from the customers, existing customers and new customers, so that we can create shareholder value and value for all of the stakeholders. In a context where revenue, total revenue would be flat, then yes, it would put pressure on the economics of the business. As you know, from a store portfolio standpoint, since the beginning of the Renew Blue journey, we've said that we would, over time, optimize the store footprint, and we are doing this on an ongoing basis, and we're ready to continue to do that. But I would say the overriding objective is to accelerate the growth so that it can lift all boats in our journey. And Sharon, anything you'd like to add to this?"

I also want to point out the strategic portfolio that we have of stores because about 1/3 of our customers still today actually choose to pick their orders up in our stores. So this alignment between the online channel and the ability to let the customer receive their product either through the mail or in our store, but it's more importantly about how they choose to receive it. Additionally, our stores are the magic that go behind our ship-from-store and our delivery times which, as you know, we've created a North Star, which is Amazon Prime. And with that, our stores are essential to that process. So the store portfolio, while to Hubert's point we have rationalized the portfolio, and we'll continue to do so, the stores are also really working hard on a concept, which we talked about for a long time, which is our value add. And the stores have a critical role in the growth, not only of our store channel, but the e-comm channel. And today, the number of orders that are actually being placed in our stores online and that capability, as Hubert talked about capabilities that we've been building, we have been making it easier and easier for us to convert a customer where there may be something that may not be in the store and they want it in the stores, our Blue Shirts are doing a remarkable job of converting that order in the store, which turns into an online order. So from a portfolio standpoint, I think our store portfolio is extremely strategic, and we'll continue to rationalize it. But quite frankly, it just continues to lift its performance, and that's great news for us."

The retention has been materially better than expected and much better than what we're seeing in the U.S. And I say strong capability, probably the reflection on our strong leadership position in the market and the combination of higher retention and closing stores, of course, will have a positive impact on the profitability. This is going to be a smaller, more profitable business for us. But above and beyond the short-term profit improvement, the long-term commitment is now that we've simplified the business is the ability that we have to invest in the customer experience online, in the stores and in the home. So that's what we said. I don't know that we've given specific numbers on the retention, but it's materially better. We can almost do the math because Canada is the bulk of the International business. We've given you the dates at which we closed the stores, the number also. You can almost do the math. It's a pretty significant retention. So we're very happy about it."

It took us well into the summer to rebrand them as Best Buy stores. So as you can imagine, the Canadian customer was very confused but, then there was some extraordinary expenses last year as we were going through the transition, and so it's really difficult to -- you should not extrapolate. Let me be very clear. The Q1 results and assume that kind of improvement is going to be sustained.

There was a little more CapEx because we were going to do more work in Canada. We've been doing it very methodically, testing, seeing what works, rolling it very judiciously. And what Hubert is speaking to as we work through the year is there are going to be periods especially before holiday while -- where we will be making some of those investments, and so it will be some puts and takes in the next couple of quarters around Canada.

The fact that we're telling them that we're seeing it is great. The fact that you're seeing it is just terrific, and I want to publicly again recognize their work. The work on developing the engagements and proficiency in the stores has been a key area for us, and I have to give credit where credit is due to Sheri Barnard and her team across the country in driving that. What is the form that it takes is your question. It's a number of things. The most impressive thing is that the individual level, the philosophy is that the performance of Best Buy is really the sum of the individual performance of each individual associate. The way you lift the performance of Best Buy is by getting more of the associates to be very proficient, very engaged and to achieve their individual sales targets. As you know, we're not commissioned, but we're driving performance. The form it takes in the stores is through daily coaching. Every morning, when you check in as an associate, you spend time with your supervisor looking at the results and getting a one-on-one, and it's absolutely world-class. Coaching about how you can get better at your job even though associates looking at the performance, we look at what are the things they we can get better, they can get some ideas from their Manager and then check in during the day and then check in at the end of the day. It's a systematic approach. Now on top of that, we're increasingly focused on lifting the product knowledge because proficiency is selling skills and product knowledge. We're moving to certify the associates and raising the bar in terms of what's expected. All of the executive team at Best Buy is certified to sell 4K TV and high-end networking equipment, showing that it's part of their job. If the bosses cannot do the job, then it's not a good company. So there is a -- of course, it goes to all of associates, which really beautiful to see. We believe there is a lot more room to drive performance on that basis. If we look at the percentage of our team, the percentage of associates who are achieving individual targets, we see a lot of room for improvement, and that's continued focus. So the way it manifests itself is that a store gets the traffic it gets. That's not within essentially control of store, but they're focused on it we call value add, which is difference between traffic and then the comp stores in the stores and with the given traffic to get different results, and so with the same amount of payroll, you can get different results. So we think that this is another gift that will keep giving and truly a remarkable set of accomplishment so far. Sheri, congratulations for your work, but beyond Sheri, well done to the entire Best Buy team across their stores. Couldn't be more proud.
So I need to conclude the call. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Again, a very strong quarter. Again, I want to congratulate all of our teams. We are, as you can feel, we are very excited to have the opportunity continue to work on our key priorities and with the opportunities that are related to that. I want to join everybody, of course, on the call in congratulating Sharon and Corie. I know Corie is very much looking forward to meeting all of you and working with all of you. I know Sharon is very much looking forward to introducing -- as a reminder, Sharon is not going away. She's going to be here until the end of the year in advisory role. She introduced Corie to each of the investors and analysts and work with Corie to make this an incredibly seamless transition. It's one of -- going to be one of Sharon's legacy -- her legacies to have successfully onboarded, chosen and onboarded and groomed and onboarded Corie. So very exciting time ahead. Thank you so much for your attention. You all have a great day."

Thank you for joining us. Let me begin by discussing the announcement we made today regarding Sharon McCollam and Corie Barry.

Let me begin by discussing the announcement we made today regarding Sharon McCollam and Corie Barry. Of course, I first want to thank Sharon for the profound and lasting impact she's had on Best Buy and our amazing partnership. As you all know, Sharon came out of retirement in 2012 to help revitalize Best Buy when the company was facing a multifaceted crisis. 3.5 years later, we are in a very different place and are into the next phase of our journey as a company. And so as she transitions out of her role, Sharon can look forward to spending more time with her husband with a sense of accomplishment and confidence in Best Buy's future. 
Now one of Sharon's legacies is her successor in the CFO role, Corie Barry. Corie is a 16-year veteran of Best Buy and our current Chief Strategic Growth Officer. She's been groomed by Sharon for the CFO role almost since the time Sharon joined the company, and the 2 have collaborated on succession planning with the goal of making this a seamless transition. Over her many years at Best Buy, Corie has had a number of operational and financial roles in the field and at the corporate level, including as Senior Vice President of U.S. Finance and as the interim head of our services business. The board, Sharon and I firmly believe that Corie has the kind of experience, skills and passion for Best Buy that make for the perfect choice for this position. I look forward to working with her in her new role. 
Sharon will remain as CFO until our Annual Shareholder Meeting on June 14, at which time Corie will assume her responsibilities. As part of this transition plan, Sharon will remain with Best Buy in an advisory role until the end of the fiscal year. The duties Sharon has as Chief Administrative Officer will be assumed by several members of our executive team. So let me say once again how grateful we are to Sharon for all that she has done. Her legacy will endure. To Corie, allow me to publicly extend my congratulations. She's been a key player in Best Buy's resurgence, and I'm confident she'll be a great leader for our company in the years ahead.
Altogether, I feel this is a remarkable time for our company. We have an exciting set of assets and opportunities and a very strong team committed to creating great results for all our stakeholders. 
I will now provide an overview of our first quarter performance and an update on our progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities, and I will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details in our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.
In the first quarter, we delivered better-than-expected Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion, a 30 basis point improvement in our non-GAAP operating income rate to 2.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.37 last year. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered better-than-expected, essentially flat comparable sales versus our guidance of a 1% to 2% decline. Contributing to these better-than-expected results was the strong performance in our online channel, which grew 24% in the quarter. And similar to last quarter's trend from a merchandising perspective, we saw strong year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, offset by continued softness in mobile phones and tablets. 
Industry sales in the NPD-reported categories, which don't reflect mobile phone and appliance sales, declined 1.9%, including the benefit of the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 fiscal 2017. We also saw significant gains in our Net Promoter Score, which improved more than 600 basis points compared to this time last year, more than 600 basis points. 
In our International business, strong execution and higher sales retention in our Canadian business drove a better-than-expected revenue decline of 1.2% on a constant currency basis despite closing approximately 1/3 or 66 of our large format stores on March 28 of last year. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% versus our guidance of a 15% to 20% decline, primarily due to a lower-than-expected negative impact from foreign currency and the higher sales retention we are seeing in Canada. So altogether, a strong quarter, and I want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering these results. 
Now I'd like to share highlights of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. As we discussed on our Q4 call, our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. This involves implementing a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital, stores, supply chain, services and customer care. 
In appliances, we leveraged our 176 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver a 14% increase in revenue and our 22nd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. As a reminder, we will continue to roll out incremental stores-within-a-store throughout the year. 
In home theater, our market-leading customer experience around 4K and large-screen technologies continue to drive sales growth and market share gains. To continue to build on this experience, we're rolling out 376 new LG experiences in addition to our existing Sony and Samsung experiences. In computing, similar to home theater, our partnership with key vendors and the strengths of our market-leading position have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. 
In mobile, we added 25 incremental Verizon and AT&T stores-within-a-store to the 250 we rolled out in the back half of last year. However, the mobile phone category remains challenging as industry demand continues to be soft. Despite this current softness, we continue to believe that over the course of the year, iconic new phone launches can drive renewed growth in this category. 
In our online business, our 24% sales growth was driven by continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dotcom capabilities, including faster shipping. We continue to focus on improving the shopping journey for our customers, including streamlining the checkout process, providing visibility earlier in the shopping funnel for local store product availability, improving the quality and relevance of product recommendations and increasing search relevancy and accuracy. 
In our retail stores, the level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to drive meaningful improvement in our Net Promoter Score among both purchasers and nonpurchasers and is contributing to our market share gains. In our services business, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increase our Net Promoter Score. 
Year-over-year, our Geek Squad agents also drove more customer interactions across our channels and helped more customers use and enjoy their technology products. As expected, overall services revenue declined during the quarter, due to the carryover effect of the pricing investments we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims in our extended warranties. 
As a reminder, while at face value, this repair revenue decline appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial because it reflects a reduction of our extended warranty costs. In our international business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation. As reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. 
Looking ahead, our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that is enabled by the consolidation of the 2 brands. 
Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing costs is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. This work is well on its way. I want to stress that this is not an isolated short-term cost-reduction program. We're establishing a lean culture focused on systematically eliminating nonquality and defects. This approach requires collaboration across teams and functions, and we're building the organizational capability, mindset and habits necessary to sustain changes. 
As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the first quarter, bringing our current achievements to $200 million. 
The third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short pressures, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity-rich environment. We're investing to make it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. 
We see fiscal '17 as a year of exploration and experimentation around creating compelling customer experiences that have the potential to unlock growth. Throughout the year, we will be testing and piloting several concepts around the country, and with our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
So to recap, we delivered a strong first quarter and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 full year financial outlook that we provided in our Q4 call. That outlook includes approximately flat revenue and non-GAAP operating income with EPS growth driven by share repurchases. 
Although we're reporting better-than-expected results today, we're not raising our full year outlook as the first quarter represents less than 15% of full year earnings. And at this stage, we have no new material information as it relates to product launches throughout the year. 
And now and of course, it's a bit emotional, let me turn the call over to my friend, Sharon McCollam. Sharon, anything you want to share with us this morning?"

Okay, so now let's talk about our Q1 results. Before I talk about these results versus last year, I'd like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you on our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our exp",1020,"Thank you, Hubert. Okay, so now let's talk about our Q1 results. 
Before I talk about these results versus last year, I'd like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you on our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our expectations, driven equally by the outperformance of our Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the flow-through of higher revenue. Additionally, a lower effective income tax rate contributed to an incremental $0.01 of EPS versus our expectations. 
I will now talk about our Q1 results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, Enterprise revenue declined 0.8% to $8.44 billion, primarily due to the impact of Domestic and Canadian store closures. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue declined 1.3%, reflecting approximately 55 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 19% to $0.44. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year and a $0.04 per share benefit from share repurchases. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of lower revenue in the Domestic segment and a higher non-GAAP effective income tax rate. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased a less-than-expected 0.8% to $7.8 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by the loss of revenue from 13 large format and 24 Best Buy Mobile store closures. Comparable sales were essentially flat. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones, tablets and gaming. As expected, television sales related to the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 '17 positively impacted the Domestic segment by approximately 70 basis points. 
In services, comparable revenue declined 10.7% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.9% to $832 million, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 210 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.5% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.2% to $614 million due primarily to closed stores in Canada. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 8.1%, reflecting approximately 690 basis points of negative foreign currency impacts. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23%, primarily due to a prior year reserve on non-iconic phone inventory, which did not recur this year and improved rates, primarily driven by our more disciplined promotional strategy across product categories. These increases were partially offset by our investment in service pricing. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as we lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increase promotional activity related to the brand consolidation in Q1 fiscal '16, and we received a higher periodic profit sharing payment in our services business. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or flat on a rate basis. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.56 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which was flat year-over-year as investments in the business were offset by the flow-through of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. 
From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $156 million or 25.4% of revenue, a decrease of $23 million or 140 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
I'll now discuss our fiscal 2017 and Q2 '17 outlook. As Hubert said, from a financial outlook perspective, we are reaffirming our expectations of approximately flat revenue and flat non-GAAP operating income for the full year, including lapping the significant periodic profit sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal '16. A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. Based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out, we are expecting slight declines in revenue in the first half followed by growth in the back half. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize this will be challenging without a stronger mobile cycle and improvements in the NPD-reported categories overall. I would now like to talk about our Q2 financial guidance. For Q2, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, and both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales of approximately flat. We expect International revenues to decline approximately 5% to 10% on a reported basis but to be flat on a constant currency basis. 
We expect our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 325 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 36% to 36.5%. In line with our original expectations, there are 2 factors impacting our Q2 year-over-year non-GAAP EPS guidance. 
First, we are expecting an approximate $0.03 net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic service profit sharing payment from our services plan portfolio that we received in the second quarter of last year. 
Second, we are expecting an approximate $0.06 negative impact from the carryover of last September's services pricing investment. In addition, in digital imaging, we are now expecting an approximate $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact due to the April 2016 earthquake in Japan, which is impacting inventory availability in this high-margin category. 
Combined, these are putting $0.12 to $0.13 of pressure on Q2 fiscal '17, which will be partially offset by approximate $0.04 benefit from share repurchases. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

One is that the e-commerce channel is growing; and two, it's impacting the entire business. Specifically to the growth rate in e-commerce, the 24% growth rate is a very good number. It's really the cumulative effective of the investments we've been making in the last 3 years that are impacting the customer experience. We're shipping faster. That's a very important point. But if you go on the site, and I hope all of you are regular shoppers on the site, 3 years ago, I would have characterized our site as being clunky. Today, there's all sorts of good surprises as you shop, as you research, as you look for information about the products. We've made improvements in the quarter on the checkout process. So it's a lot of small changes, both on the site itself and, of course, the mobile experience has been investing significantly. So really, a combination of what's happening on the site, the shipping experience. We've improved in-store pick up, the experience in the stores. So it's an all out effort, it's really the cumulative impact of the investments and improvements we've been making over the last 3 years."

The -- we think of the company as a company that is there to provide a great experience for the customer across all channels. And increasingly, it will be difficult to measure the contribution of each channel because again, and you guys all know this, the shopping journey starts online, may then be completed online or in the stores. There's a journey to the store. If you're going to buy a 4K TV, the only way to see the quality of the picture and ask questions is really in the store, but then the transaction may be completed in the store or online. So our overall goal as a company, frankly, is to accelerate the total revenue growth from the customers, existing customers and new customers, so that we can create shareholder value and value for all of the stakeholders. In a context where revenue, total revenue would be flat, then yes, it would put pressure on the economics of the business. As you know, from a store portfolio standpoint, since the beginning of the Renew Blue journey, we've said that we would, over time, optimize the store footprint, and we are doing this on an ongoing basis, and we're ready to continue to do that. But I would say the overriding objective is to accelerate the growth so that it can lift all boats in our journey. And Sharon, anything you'd like to add to this?"

I also want to point out the strategic portfolio that we have of stores because about 1/3 of our customers still today actually choose to pick their orders up in our stores. So this alignment between the online channel and the ability to let the customer receive their product either through the mail or in our store, but it's more importantly about how they choose to receive it. Additionally, our stores are the magic that go behind our ship-from-store and our delivery times which, as you know, we've created a North Star, which is Amazon Prime. And with that, our stores are essential to that process. So the store portfolio, while to Hubert's point we have rationalized the portfolio, and we'll continue to do so, the stores are also really working hard on a concept, which we talked about for a long time, which is our value add. And the stores have a critical role in the growth, not only of our store channel, but the e-comm channel. And today, the number of orders that are actually being placed in our stores online and that capability, as Hubert talked about capabilities that we've been building, we have been making it easier and easier for us to convert a customer where there may be something that may not be in the store and they want it in the stores, our Blue Shirts are doing a remarkable job of converting that order in the store, which turns into an online order. So from a portfolio standpoint, I think our store portfolio is extremely strategic, and we'll continue to rationalize it. But quite frankly, it just continues to lift its performance, and that's great news for us."

It's going to take a while before things settle because year-over-year comparisons are going to be a little bit difficult to assess. Last year, there was a lot of disruptions in Q1, Q2 and going into Q3 still. But altogether, the decision to consolidate the 2 brands was very fundamental to our future. As you remember, where these 2 brands oftentimes, 2 stores in the same parking lot made it difficult for us to invest in the stores because many of them were sub-critical mass, and so we've unlocked that. The retention has been materially better than expected and much better than what we're seeing in the U.S. And we've actually a strong capability, probably the reflection on our strong leadership position in the market and the combination of higher retention and closing stores, of course, will have a positive impact on the profitability. This is going to be a smaller, more profitable business for us. But above and beyond the short-term profit improvement, the long-term commitment because now that we've simplified the business, is the ability that we have to invest in the customer experience online, in the stores and in the home. So that's what we said. I don't know that we've given specific numbers on the retention, but it's materially better. We can almost do the math because Canada is the bulk of the International business. We've given you the dates at which we've closed the stores, the number of stores, so you can almost do the math. It's a pretty significant retention. So we're very happy about it."

And then as the technology gets more mass, then it gets into more places. And the -- at some point, the growth in TVs will slow down. It'll start reverting and then at some point, we would expect to not be able to hold the kind of great share we've had.

Now we have said for the last several years that when you're thinking about in modeling our business, you really need to model the big boxes. The mobile stores -- our goal for the mobile stores is to make them a powerful marketing customer service vehicle, a convenience play for our customers. But as far as increases in profits over the years, et cetera, that is not a modeling that we're doing and wouldn't -- certainly wouldn't want you guys to do. They'll always be plus or minus a little, but they're quite small. As far as the rationalization, we have closed some of the stores, again, very similar to our view on the big-box stores.

The fact that we're telling them that we're seeing it is great. The fact that you're seeing it is just terrific, and I want to publicly again recognize their work. The work on developing the engagements and proficiency in the stores has been a key area for us, and I have to give credit where credit is due to Shari Ballard and her team across the country in driving that. What is the form that it takes, is your question. It's a number of things. The most impressive thing is at the individual level, the philosophy is that the performance of Best Buy is really the sum of the individual performance of each individual associate. The way you lift the performance of Best Buy is by getting more of the associates to be very proficient, very engaged and to achieve their individual sales targets. As you know, we're not commissioned, but we're driving performance. The form it takes in the store is through daily coaching. Every morning, when you check in as an associate, you spend time with your supervisor looking at the results and getting a one-on-one, and it's absolutely world-class. Coaching about how you can get better at your job. The individual associate will -- looking at the performance, we look at what are the things they can get better, they may get some ideas from their manager and then check in during the day and then check in at the end of the day. It's a systematic approach. Now on top of that, we're increasingly focused on lifting the product knowledge because proficiency is selling skills and product knowledge. We're moving to certify the associates and raising the bar in terms of what's expected. All of the executive team at Best Buy is certified to sell 4K TV and high-end networking equipment, showing that it's part of their job. If the bosses cannot do the job, then it's not a good company. So there is a -- and of course, it goes to all of the associates, so it's really beautiful to see. We believe there is a lot more room to drive performance on that basis. If we look at -- with Shari, the percentage of -- in her team, we look at the percentage of associates who are achieving the individual sales targets, we see a lot of room for improvement and that's a continued focus. So the way it manifests itself is that a store gets the traffic it gets. That's not within, essentially, the control of store, but they're focused on what we call value add, which is the difference between the traffic and then the comp stores in the stores. And with a given traffic, you can get different results. And so with the same amount of payroll, you can get different results. So we think that this is another gift that will keep giving, and truly a remarkable set of accomplishments so far. So Shari, congratulations for your work, but beyond Shari, well done to the entire Best Buy team across their stores. Couldn't be more proud.
So I need to conclude the call. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Again, a very strong quarter. Again, I want to congratulate all of our teams. We are, as you can see, we are very excited to have the opportunity continue to work on our key priorities and with the opportunities that are related to that. I want to join everybody, of course, on the call in congratulating Sharon and Corie. I know Corie is very much looking forward to meeting all of you and working with all of you. I know Sharon is very much looking forward to introducing -- as a reminder, Sharon is not going away. She's going to be here until the end of the year in an advisory role. She'll introduce Corie to each of the investors and analysts and work with Corie to make this an incredibly seamless transition. It's one of -- it's going to be one of Sharon's legacy -- legacies to have successfully onboarded -- chosen and onboarded and groomed and onboarded Corie. So a very exciting time ahead.

Let me begin by discussing the announcement we made today regarding Sharon McCollam and Corie Barry. Of course, I first want to thank Sharon for the profound and lasting impact she's had on Best Buy and our amazing partnership. As you all know, Sharon came out of retirement in 2012 to help revitalize Best Buy when the company was facing a multifaceted crisis. 3.5 years later, we are in a very different place and are into the next phase of our journey as a company. And so as she transitions out of her role, Sharon can look forward to spending more time with her husband with a sense of accomplishment and confidence in Best Buy's future. 
Now one of Sharon's legacies is her successor in the CFO role, Corie Barry. Corie is a 16-year veteran of Best Buy and our current Chief Strategic Growth Officer. She's been groomed by Sharon for the CFO role almost since the time Sharon joined the company, and the 2 have collaborated on succession planning with the goal of making this a seamless transition. Over her many years at Best Buy, Corie has had a number of operational and financial roles in the field and at the corporate level, including as Senior Vice President of U.S. Finance and as the interim head of our services business. The board, Sharon and I firmly believe that Corie has the kind of experience, skills and passion for Best Buy that make for the perfect choice for this position. I look forward to working with her in her new role. 
Sharon will remain as CFO until our Annual Shareholder Meeting on June 14, at which time Corie will assume her responsibilities. As part of this transition plan, Sharon will remain with Best Buy in an advisory role until the end of the fiscal year. The duties Sharon has as Chief Administrative Officer will be assumed by several members of our executive team. So let me say once again how grateful we are to Sharon for all that she has done. Her legacy will endure. To Corie, allow me to publicly extend my congratulations. She's been a key player in Best Buy's resurgence, and I'm confident she'll be a great leader for our company in the years ahead.
Altogether, I feel this is a remarkable time for our company. We have an exciting set of assets and opportunities and a very strong team committed to creating great results for all our stakeholders. 
I will now provide an overview of our first quarter performance and an update on our progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities, and I will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details in our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.
In the first quarter, we delivered better-than-expected Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion, a 30 basis point improvement in our non-GAAP operating income rate to 2.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.37 last year. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered better-than-expected, essentially flat comparable sales versus our guidance of a 1% to 2% decline. Contributing to these better-than-expected results was the strong performance in our online channel, which grew 24% in the quarter. And similar to last quarter's trend from a merchandising perspective, we saw strong year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, offset by continued softness in mobile phones and tablets. 
Industry sales in the NPD-reported categories, which don't reflect mobile phone and appliance sales, declined 1.9%, including the benefit of the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 fiscal 2017. We also saw significant gains in our Net Promoter Score, which improved more than 600 basis points compared to this time last year, more than 600 basis points. 
In our International business, strong execution and higher sales retention in our Canadian business drove a better-than-expected revenue decline of 1.2% on a constant currency basis despite closing approximately 1/3 or 66 of our large-format stores on March 28 of last year. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% versus our guidance of a 15% to 20% decline, primarily due to a lower-than-expected negative impact from foreign currency and the higher sales retention we are seeing in Canada. So altogether, a strong quarter, and I want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering these results. 
Now I'd like to share highlights of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. As we discussed on our Q4 call, our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. This involves implementing a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital, stores, supply chain, services and customer care. 
In appliances, we leveraged our 176 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver a 14% increase in revenue and our 22nd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. As a reminder, we will continue to roll out incremental stores-within-a-store throughout the year. 
In home theater, our market-leading customer experience around 4K and large-screen technologies continue to drive sales growth and market share gains. To continue to build on this experience, we're rolling out 376 new LG experiences in addition to our existing Sony and Samsung experiences. In computing, similar to home theater, our partnership with key vendors and the strengths of our market-leading position have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. 
In mobile, we added 25 incremental Verizon and AT&T stores-within-a-store to the 250 we rolled out in the back half of last year. However, the mobile phone category remains challenging as industry demand continues to be soft. Despite this current softness, we continue to believe that over the course of the year, iconic new phone launches can drive renewed growth in this category. 
In our online business, our 24% sales growth was driven by continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dotcom capabilities, including faster shipping. We continue to focus on improving the shopping journey for our customers, including streamlining the checkout process, providing visibility earlier in the shopping funnel for local store product availability, improving the quality and relevance of product recommendations and increasing search relevancy and accuracy. 
In our retail stores, the level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to drive meaningful improvement in our Net Promoter Score among both purchasers and nonpurchasers and is contributing to our market share gains. In our services business, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increase our Net Promoter Score. 
Year-over-year, our Geek Squad agents also drove more customer interactions across our channels and helped more customers use and enjoy their technology products. As expected, overall services revenue declined during the quarter due to the carryover effect of the pricing investments we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims in our extended warranties. 
As a reminder, while at face value, this repair revenue decline appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial because it reflects a reduction of our extended warranty costs. In our International business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation. As reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. 
Looking ahead, our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that is enabled by the consolidation of the 2 brands. 
Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing costs is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. This work is well on its way. I want to stress that this is not an isolated short-term cost-reduction program. We're establishing a lean culture focused on systematically eliminating nonquality and defects. This approach requires collaboration across teams and functions, and we're building the organizational capability, mindset and habits necessary to sustain changes. 
As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the first quarter, bringing our current achievements to $200 million. 
The third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short-term pressures, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity-rich environment. We're investing to make it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. 
We see fiscal '17 as a year of exploration and experimentation around creating compelling customer experiences that have the potential to unlock growth. Throughout the year, we will be testing and piloting several concepts around the country, and with our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
So to recap, we delivered a strong first quarter and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 full year financial outlook that we provided in our Q4 call. That outlook includes approximately flat revenue and non-GAAP operating income, with EPS growth driven by share repurchases. 
Although we're reporting better-than-expected results today, we're not raising our full year outlook as the first quarter represents less than 15% of full year earnings. And at this stage, we have no new material information as it relates to product launches throughout the year. 
And now and of course, it's a bit emotional, let me turn the call over to my friend, Sharon McCollam. Sharon, anything you want to share with us this morning?"

Thank you. While I remain in an advisory capacity through the end of the year, this is my last official call as CFO, and as such, I want to take this opportunity to express what an immense privilege it has been to be part of this incredible transformation [ph]. With our team of more than 125,000 people, we have worked hand in hand to Renew Blue. And today, as I prepare to step down from my current role to spend more time with my husband and my family, I do so knowing that we have never been as well positioned as we are today to take Best Buy to a new level. 
I'd like to thank my peers, our corporate and field teams and, in particular, my direct reports for their exceptional contributions that have made this possible. I would also like to thank our board and you, our shareholders and analysts, for your confidence and support. 
Additionally, I want to publicly congratulate Corie. Corie has been my strategic right-hand partner since I joined Best Buy. With her exceptional financial acumen and deep understanding of Best Buy's operations, she has been an influential leader over the financial and cost discipline that have been established across the company over the past several years. She is also a highly respected cross-functional leader and will be an incredible CFO, of whom I could not be more proud or confident. So congratulations, Corie. 
And of course, I want to thank Hubert. You're an extraordinary leader and an inspiring business partner and a friend. I will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to share this journey with you and our entire Best Buy family."

Okay, so now let's talk about our Q1 results. Before I talk about these results versus last year, I'd like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you on our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our exp",1021,"Thank you, Hubert. Okay, so now let's talk about our Q1 results. 
Before I talk about these results versus last year, I'd like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you on our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our expectations, driven equally by the outperformance of our Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the flow-through of higher revenue. Additionally, a lower effective income tax rate contributed to an incremental $0.01 of EPS versus our expectations. 
I will now talk about our Q1 results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, Enterprise revenue declined 0.8% to $8.44 billion, primarily due to the impact of Domestic and Canadian store closures. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue declined 1.3%, reflecting approximately 55 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 19% to $0.44. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year, and a $0.04 per share benefit from share repurchases. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of lower revenue in the Domestic segment and a higher non-GAAP effective income tax rate. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased a less-than-expected 0.8% to $7.8 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by the loss of revenue from 13 large format and 24 Best Buy Mobile store closures. Comparable sales were essentially flat. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones, tablets and gaming. As expected, television sales related to the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 '17 positively impacted the Domestic segment by approximately 70 basis points. 
In services, comparable revenue declined 10.7% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.9% to $832 million, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 210 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.5% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.2% to $614 million due primarily to closed stores in Canada. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 8.1%, reflecting approximately 690 basis points of negative foreign currency impacts. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23%, primarily due to a prior year reserve on non-iconic phone inventory, which did not recur this year, and improved rates, primarily driven by our more disciplined promotional strategy across product categories. These increases were partially offset by our investment in service pricing. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as we lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity related to the brand consolidation in Q1 fiscal '16, and we received a higher periodic profit sharing payment in our services business. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or flat on a rate basis. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.56 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which was flat year-over-year as investments in the business were offset by the flow-through of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. 
From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $156 million or 25.4% of revenue, a decrease of $23 million or 140 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
I'll now discuss our fiscal 2017 and Q2 '17 outlook. As Hubert said, from a financial outlook perspective, we are reaffirming our expectations of approximately flat revenue and flat non-GAAP operating income for the full year, including lapping the significant periodic profit sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal '16. A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. Based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out, we are expecting slight declines in revenue in the first half followed by growth in the back half. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize this will be challenging without a stronger mobile cycle and improvements in the NPD-reported categories overall. I would now like to talk about our Q2 financial guidance. For Q2, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, and both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales of approximately flat. We expect International revenues to decline approximately 5% to 10% on a reported basis but to be flat on a constant currency basis. 
We expect our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 325 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 36% to 36.5%. In line with our original expectations, there are 2 factors impacting our Q2 year-over-year non-GAAP EPS guidance. 
First, we are expecting an approximate $0.03 net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic service profit sharing payment from our services plan portfolio that we received in the second quarter of last year. 
Second, we are expecting an approximate $0.06 negative impact from the carryover of last September's services pricing investment. In addition, in digital imaging, we are now expecting an approximate $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact due to the April 2016 earthquake in Japan, which is impacting inventory availability in this high-margin category. 
Combined, these are putting $0.12 to $0.13 of pressure on Q2 fiscal '17, which will be partially offset by an approximate $0.04 benefit from share repurchases. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

But if you go on the site, and I hope all of you are regular shoppers on the site, 3 years ago, I would have characterized our site as being clunky.

The -- we think of the company as a company that is there to provide a great experience for the customer across all channels. And increasingly, it will be difficult to measure the contribution of each channel because again, and you guys all know this, the shopping journey starts online, may then be completed online or in the stores. There's a journey to the store. If you're going to buy a 4K TV, the only way to see the quality of the picture and ask questions is really in the store, but then the transaction may be completed in the store or online. So our overall goal as a company, frankly, is to accelerate the total revenue growth from the customers, existing customers and new customers, so that we can create shareholder value and value for all of the stakeholders. In a context where revenue, total revenue would be flat, then yes, it would put pressure on the economics of the business. As you know, from a store portfolio standpoint, since the beginning of the Renew Blue journey, we've said that we would, over time, optimize the store footprint, and we are doing this on an ongoing basis, and we're ready to continue to do that. But I would say the overriding objective is to accelerate the growth so that it can lift all boats in our journey. And Sharon, anything you'd like to add to this?"

So this alignment between the online channel and the ability to let the customer receive their product either through the mail or in our store, but it's more importantly about how they choose to receive it. Additionally, our stores are the magic that go behind our ship-from-store and our delivery times which, as you know, we've created a North Star, which is Amazon Prime. And with that, our stores are essential to that process. So the store portfolio, while to Hubert's point we have rationalized the portfolio, and we'll continue to do so, the stores are also really working hard on a concept, which we talked about for a long time, which is our value add. And the stores have a critical role in the growth not only of our store channel, but the e-comm channel. And today, the number of orders that are actually being placed in our stores online and that capability, as Hubert talked about capabilities that we've been building, we have been making it easier and easier for us to convert a customer where there may be something that may not be in the store and they want it in the stores. Our Blue Shirts are doing a remarkable job of converting that order in the store, which turns into an online order. So from a portfolio standpoint, I think our store portfolio is extremely strategic, and we'll continue to rationalize it. But quite frankly, it just continues to lift its performance, and that's great news for us."

Quarter-to-quarter, things will fluctuate a little bit based on variable compensation. Marketing, that fluctuates a little bit. In the first quarter, we're very proud of the cost reductions we've made that have offset the investments. So for the full year, that's the pattern we have talked about and that we'll continue to drive. And we're pacing ourselves, it's a discipline that we have. We're pacing the investments based on the cost reductions. Sharon, anything you'd like to add?"

It's going to take a while before things settle because year-over-year comparisons are going to be a little bit difficult to assess. Last year, there was a lot of disruptions in Q1, Q2 and going into Q3 still. But altogether, the decision to consolidate the 2 brands was very fundamental to our future. As you remember, where these 2 brands oftentimes, 2 stores in the same parking lot made it difficult for us to invest in the stores because many of them were sub-critical mass, and so we've unlocked that. The retention has been materially better than expected and much better than what we're seeing in the U.S. And that's a strong capability, probably the reflection on our strong leadership position in the market and the combination of higher retention, and closing stores, of course, will have a positive impact on the profitability. This is going to be a smaller, more profitable business for us. But above and beyond the short-term profit improvement, the long-term commitment, because now that we've simplified the business, is the ability that we have to invest in the customer experience online, in the stores and in the home. So that's what we said. I don't know that we've given specific numbers on the retention, but it's materially better. We can almost do the math because Canada is the bulk of the International business. We've given you the dates at which we've closed the stores, the number of stores, so you can almost do the math. It's a pretty significant retention. So we're very happy about it."

So that's very material. We expect this will continue in the back half and so forth, which will make the category very exciting from a consumer standpoint. And again, we'll start to bring this to a more mass status. We remain very confident in the amazing customer experience that we've built, both online but notably in our stores. If you want to buy a 4K TV, we are the place to do this. Our teams are ready."

The fact that we're telling them that we're seeing it is great. The fact that you're seeing it is just terrific, and I want to publicly again recognize their work. The work on developing the engagements and proficiency in the stores has been a key area for us, and I have to give credit where credit is due to Shari Ballard and her team across the country in driving that. What is the form that it takes, is your question. It's a number of things. The most impressive thing is at the individual level, the philosophy is that the performance of Best Buy is really the sum of the individual performance of each individual associate. The way you lift the performance of Best Buy is by getting more of the associates to be very proficient, very engaged and to achieve their individual sales targets. As you know, we're not commissioned, but we're driving performance. The form it takes in the store is through daily coaching. Every morning, when you check in as an associate, you spend time with your supervisor looking at the results and getting a one-on-one, and it's absolutely world-class. Coaching about how you can get better at your job. The individual associate will -- looking at the performance, we look at what are the things they can get better. They may get some ideas from their manager and then check in during the day and then check in at the end of the day. It's a systematic approach. Now on top of that, we're increasingly focused on lifting the product knowledge because proficiency is selling skills and product knowledge. We're moving to certify the associates and raising the bar in terms of what's expected. All of the executive team at Best Buy is certified to sell 4K TV and high-end networking equipment, showing that it's part of their job. If the bosses cannot do the job, then it's not a good company. So there is a -- and of course, it goes to all of the associates, so it's really beautiful to see. We believe there is a lot more room to drive performance on that basis. If we look at -- with Shari, the percentage of -- and her team, we look at the percentage of associates who are achieving the individual sales targets, we see a lot of room for improvement and that's a continued focus. So the way it manifests itself is that a store gets the traffic it gets. That's not within, essentially, the control of store, but they're focused on what we call value add, which is the difference between the traffic and then the comp stores in the stores. And with a given traffic, you can get different results. And so with the same amount of payroll, you can get different results. So we think that this is another gift that will keep giving, and truly a remarkable set of accomplishments so far. So Shari, congratulations for your work, but beyond Shari, well done to the entire Best Buy team across their stores. Couldn't be more proud.
So I need to conclude the call. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Again, a very strong quarter. Again, I want to congratulate all of our teams. We are -- as you can see, we are very excited to have the opportunity continue to work on our key priorities and with the opportunities that are related to that. I want to join everybody, of course, on the call in congratulating Sharon and Corie. I know Corie is very much looking forward to meeting all of you and working with all of you. I know Sharon is very much looking forward to introducing -- as a reminder, Sharon is not going away. She's going to be here until the end of the year in an advisory role. She'll introduce Corie to each of the investors and analysts and work with Corie to make this an incredibly seamless transition. It's one of -- it's going to be one of Sharon's legacy -- legacies to have successfully onboarded -- chosen and onboarded and groomed and onboarded Corie. So a very exciting time ahead. Thank you so much for your attention. You all have a great day."

Thank you for joining us. Let me begin by discussing the announcement we made today regarding Sharon McCollam and Corie Barry.

Let me begin by discussing the announcement we made today regarding Sharon McCollam and Corie Barry. Of course, I first want to thank Sharon for the profound and lasting impact she's had on Best Buy and our amazing partnership. As you all know, Sharon came out of retirement in 2012 to help revitalize Best Buy when the company was facing a multifaceted crisis. 3.5 years later, we are in a very different place and are into the next phase of our journey as a company. And so as she transitions out of her role, Sharon can look forward to spending more time with her husband with a sense of accomplishment and confidence in Best Buy's future. 
Now one of Sharon's legacies is her successor in the CFO role, Corie Barry. Corie is a 16-year veteran of Best Buy and our current Chief Strategic Growth Officer. She's been groomed by Sharon for the CFO role almost since the time Sharon joined the company, and the 2 have collaborated on succession planning with the goal of making this a seamless transition. Over her many years at Best Buy, Corie has had a number of operational and financial roles in the field and at the corporate level, including as Senior Vice President of U.S. Finance and as the interim head of our services business. The board, Sharon and I firmly believe that Corie has the kind of experience, skills and passion for Best Buy that make for the perfect choice for this position. I look forward to working with her in her new role. 
Sharon will remain as CFO until our Annual Shareholder Meeting on June 14, at which time Corie will assume her responsibilities. As part of this transition plan, Sharon will remain with Best Buy in an advisory role until the end of the fiscal year. The duties Sharon has as Chief Administrative Officer will be assumed by several members of our executive team. So let me say once again how grateful we are to Sharon for all that she has done. Her legacy will endure. To Corie, allow me to publicly extend my congratulations. She's been a key player in Best Buy's resurgence, and I'm confident she'll be a great leader for our company in the years ahead.
Altogether, I feel this is a remarkable time for our company. We have an exciting set of assets and opportunities and a very strong team committed to creating great results for all our stakeholders. 
I will now provide an overview of our first quarter performance and an update on our progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities, and I will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details in our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.
In the first quarter, we delivered better-than-expected Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion, a 30 basis point improvement in our non-GAAP operating income rate to 2.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.37 last year. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered better-than-expected, essentially flat comparable sales versus our guidance of a 1% to 2% decline. Contributing to these better-than-expected results was the strong performance in our online channel, which grew 24% in the quarter. And similar to last quarter's trend from a merchandising perspective, we saw strong year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, offset by continued softness in mobile phones and tablets. 
Industry sales in the NPD-reported categories, which don't reflect mobile phone and appliance sales, declined 1.9%, including the benefit of the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 fiscal 2017. We also saw significant gains in our Net Promoter Score, which improved more than 600 basis points compared to this time last year, more than 600 basis points. 
In our International business, strong execution and higher sales retention in our Canadian business drove a better-than-expected revenue decline of 1.2% on a constant currency basis despite closing approximately 1/3 or 66 of our large-format stores on March 28 of last year. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% versus our guidance of a 15% to 20% decline, primarily due to a lower-than-expected negative impact from foreign currency and the higher sales retention we are seeing in Canada. So altogether, a strong quarter, and I want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering these results. 
Now I'd like to share highlights of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. As we discussed on our Q4 call, our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. This involves implementing a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital, stores, supply chain, services and customer care. 
In appliances, we leveraged our 176 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver a 14% increase in revenue and our 22nd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. As a reminder, we will continue to roll out incremental stores-within-a-store throughout the year. 
In home theater, our market-leading customer experience around 4K and large-screen technologies continue to drive sales growth and market share gains. To continue to build on this experience, we're rolling out 376 new LG experiences in addition to our existing Sony and Samsung experiences. In computing, similar to home theater, our partnership with key vendors and the strengths of our market-leading position have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. 
In mobile, we added 25 incremental Verizon and AT&T stores-within-a-store to the 250 we rolled out in the back half of last year. However, the mobile phone category remains challenging as industry demand continues to be soft. Despite this current softness, we continue to believe that over the course of the year, iconic new phone launches can drive renewed growth in this category. 
In our online business, our 24% sales growth was driven by continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dotcom capabilities, including faster shipping. We continue to focus on improving the shopping journey for our customers, including streamlining the checkout process, providing visibility earlier in the shopping funnel for local store product availability, improving the quality and relevance of product recommendations and increasing search relevancy and accuracy. 
In our retail stores, the level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to drive meaningful improvement in our Net Promoter Score among both purchasers and nonpurchasers and is contributing to our market share gains. In our services business, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increase our Net Promoter Score. 
Year-over-year, our Geek Squad agents also drove more customer interactions across our channels and helped more customers use and enjoy their technology products. As expected, overall services revenue declined during the quarter due to the carryover effect of the pricing investments we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims in our extended warranties. 
As a reminder, while at face value, this repair revenue decline appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial because it reflects a reduction of our extended warranty costs. In our International business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation. As reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. 
Looking ahead, our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that is enabled by the consolidation of the 2 brands. 
Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing costs is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. This work is well on its way. I want to stress that this is not an isolated short-term cost-reduction program. We're establishing a lean culture focused on systematically eliminating nonquality and defects. This approach requires collaboration across teams and functions, and we're building the organizational capability, mindset and habits necessary to sustain changes. 
As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the first quarter, bringing our current achievements to $200 million. 
The third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short-term pressures, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity-rich environment. We're investing to make it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. 
We see fiscal '17 as a year of exploration and experimentation around creating compelling customer experiences that have the potential to unlock growth. Throughout the year, we will be testing and piloting several concepts around the country, and with our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
So to recap, we delivered a strong first quarter and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 full year financial outlook that we provided in our Q4 call. That outlook includes approximately flat revenue and non-GAAP operating income, with EPS growth driven by share repurchases. 
Although we're reporting better-than-expected results today, we're not raising our full year outlook as the first quarter represents less than 15% of full year earnings. And at this stage, we have no new material information as it relates to product launches throughout the year. 
And now and of course, it's a bit emotional, let me turn the call over to my friend, Sharon McCollam. Sharon, anything you want to share with us this morning?"

Okay, so now let's talk about our Q1 results. Before I talk about these results versus last year, I'd like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you on our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our exp",1021,"Thank you, Hubert. Okay, so now let's talk about our Q1 results. 
Before I talk about these results versus last year, I'd like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you on our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our expectations, driven equally by the outperformance of our Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the flow-through of higher revenue. Additionally, a lower effective income tax rate contributed to an incremental $0.01 of EPS versus our expectations. 
I will now talk about our Q1 results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, Enterprise revenue declined 0.8% to $8.44 billion, primarily due to the impact of Domestic and Canadian store closures. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue declined 1.3%, reflecting approximately 55 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 19% to $0.44. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year, and a $0.04 per share benefit from share repurchases. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of lower revenue in the Domestic segment and a higher non-GAAP effective income tax rate. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased a less-than-expected 0.8% to $7.8 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by the loss of revenue from 13 large format and 24 Best Buy Mobile store closures. Comparable sales were essentially flat. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones, tablets and gaming. As expected, television sales related to the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 '17 positively impacted the Domestic segment by approximately 70 basis points. 
In services, comparable revenue declined 10.7% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.9% to $832 million, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 210 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.5% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.2% to $614 million due primarily to closed stores in Canada. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 8.1%, reflecting approximately 690 basis points of negative foreign currency impacts. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23%, primarily due to a prior year reserve on non-iconic phone inventory, which did not recur this year, and improved rates, primarily driven by our more disciplined promotional strategy across product categories. These increases were partially offset by our investment in service pricing. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as we lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity related to the brand consolidation in Q1 fiscal '16, and we received a higher periodic profit sharing payment in our services business. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or flat on a rate basis. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.56 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which was flat year-over-year as investments in the business were offset by the flow-through of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. 
From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $156 million or 25.4% of revenue, a decrease of $23 million or 140 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
I'll now discuss our fiscal 2017 and Q2 '17 outlook. As Hubert said, from a financial outlook perspective, we are reaffirming our expectations of approximately flat revenue and flat non-GAAP operating income for the full year, including lapping the significant periodic profit sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal '16. A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. Based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out, we are expecting slight declines in revenue in the first half followed by growth in the back half. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize this will be challenging without a stronger mobile cycle and improvements in the NPD-reported categories overall. I would now like to talk about our Q2 financial guidance. For Q2, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, and both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales of approximately flat. We expect International revenues to decline approximately 5% to 10% on a reported basis but to be flat on a constant currency basis. 
We expect our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 325 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 36% to 36.5%. In line with our original expectations, there are 2 factors impacting our Q2 year-over-year non-GAAP EPS guidance. 
First, we are expecting an approximate $0.03 net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic service profit sharing payment from our services plan portfolio that we received in the second quarter of last year. 
Second, we are expecting an approximate $0.06 negative impact from the carryover of last September's services pricing investment. In addition, in digital imaging, we are now expecting an approximate $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact due to the April 2016 earthquake in Japan, which is impacting inventory availability in this high-margin category. 
Combined, these are putting $0.12 to $0.13 of pressure on Q2 fiscal '17, which will be partially offset by an approximate $0.04 benefit from share repurchases. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

But if you go on the site, and I hope all of you are regular shoppers on the site, 3 years ago, I would have characterized our site as being clunky.

And increasingly, it will be difficult to measure the contribution of each channel because again, and you guys all know this, the shopping journey starts online, may then be completed online or in the stores. There's a journey to the store. If you're going to buy a 4K TV, the only way to see the quality of the picture and ask questions is really in the store, but then the transaction may be completed in the store or online. So our overall goal as a company, frankly, is to accelerate the total revenue growth from the customers, existing customers and new customers, so that we can create shareholder value and value for all of the stakeholders. In a context where revenue, total revenue would be flat, then yes, it would put pressure on the economics of the business. As you know, from a store portfolio standpoint, since the beginning of the Renew Blue journey, we've said that we would, over time, optimize the store footprint, and we are doing this on an ongoing basis, and we're ready to continue to do that. But I would say the overriding objective is to accelerate the growth so that it can lift all boats in our journey. And Sharon, anything you'd like to add to this?"

So this alignment between the online channel and the ability to let the customer receive their product either through the mail or in our store, but it's more importantly about how they choose to receive it. Additionally, our stores are the magic that go behind our ship-from-store and our delivery times which, as you know, we've created a North Star, which is Amazon Prime. And with that, our stores are essential to that process. So the store portfolio, while to Hubert's point we have rationalized the portfolio, and we'll continue to do so, the stores are also really working hard on a concept, which we talked about for a long time, which is our value add. And the stores have a critical role in the growth not only of our store channel, but the e-comm channel. And today, the number of orders that are actually being placed in our stores online and that capability, as Hubert talked about capabilities that we've been building, we have been making it easier and easier for us to convert a customer where there may be something that may not be in the store and they want it in the stores. Our Blue Shirts are doing a remarkable job of converting that order in the store, which turns into an online order. So from a portfolio standpoint, I think our store portfolio is extremely strategic, and we'll continue to rationalize it. But quite frankly, it just continues to lift its performance, and that's great news for us."

It's going to take a while before things settle because year-over-year comparisons are going to be a little bit difficult to assess. Last year, there was a lot of disruptions in Q1, Q2 and going into Q3 still. But altogether, the decision to consolidate the 2 brands was very fundamental to our future. As you remember, where these 2 brands oftentimes, 2 stores in the same parking lot made it difficult for us to invest in the stores because many of them were sub-critical mass, and so we've unlocked that. The retention has been materially better than expected and much better than what we're seeing in the U.S. And that's a strong capability, probably the reflection on our strong leadership position in the market and the combination of higher retention, and closing stores, of course, will have a positive impact on the profitability. This is going to be a smaller, more profitable business for us. But above and beyond the short-term profit improvement, the long-term commitment, because now that we've simplified the business, is the ability that we have to invest in the customer experience online, in the stores and in the home. So that's what we said. I don't know that we've given specific numbers on the retention, but it's materially better. We can almost do the math because Canada is the bulk of the International business. We've given you the dates at which we've closed the stores, the number of stores, so you can almost do the math.

So just following up on that question, can you talk about share in the TV category? And yes, I think a lot of retailers talked about deceleration in the April, May time frame. It doesn't seem like that actually happened to you because ex Super Bowl shift, you're still guiding to about the same comp in the second quarter. So what changed in the business during that time frame? Was that PC getting better? Was that mobile picking up a little bit more there?"

It's very consistent with Q1 and so we'll continue to monitor this. One element of philosophy for the company is that there may be fluctuations in the customer buying intentions and mood and so forth. We know what we can control. And the focus on execution, our ability to control what we can control is a key mantra at the company across all touch points. And believe me, while we're proud of what we've done, we have so much more to do across all channels in driving our performance. So we'll continue to be focused on that. When we manage our teams, we're not interested in excuses of any sort. It's all about the performance they can drive."

The fact that we're telling them that we're seeing it is great. The fact that you're seeing it is just terrific, and I want to publicly again recognize their work. The work on developing the engagements and proficiency in the stores has been a key area for us, and I have to give credit where credit is due to Shari Ballard and her team across the country in driving that. What is the form that it takes, is your question. It's a number of things. The most impressive thing is at the individual level, the philosophy is that the performance of Best Buy is really the sum of the individual performance of each individual associate. The way you lift the performance of Best Buy is by getting more of the associates to be very proficient, very engaged and to achieve their individual sales targets. As you know, we're not commissioned, but we're driving performance. The form it takes in the store is through daily coaching. Every morning, when you check in as an associate, you spend time with your supervisor looking at the results and getting a one-on-one, and it's absolutely world-class. Coaching about how you can get better at your job. The individual associate will -- looking at the performance, we look at what are the things they can get better. They may get some ideas from their manager and then check in during the day and then check in at the end of the day. It's a systematic approach. Now on top of that, we're increasingly focused on lifting the product knowledge because proficiency is selling skills and product knowledge. We're moving to certify the associates and raising the bar in terms of what's expected. All of the executive team at Best Buy is certified to sell 4K TV and high-end networking equipment, showing that it's part of their job. If the bosses cannot do the job, then it's not a good company. So there is a -- and of course, it goes to all of the associates, so it's really beautiful to see. We believe there is a lot more room to drive performance on that basis. If we look at -- with Shari, the percentage of -- and her team, we look at the percentage of associates who are achieving the individual sales targets, we see a lot of room for improvement and that's a continued focus. So the way it manifests itself is that a store gets the traffic it gets. That's not within, essentially, the control of store, but they're focused on what we call value add, which is the difference between the traffic and then the comp stores in the stores. And with a given traffic, you can get different results. And so with the same amount of payroll, you can get different results. So we think that this is another gift that will keep giving, and truly a remarkable set of accomplishments so far. So Shari, congratulations for your work, but beyond Shari, well done to the entire Best Buy team across their stores. Couldn't be more proud.
So I need to conclude the call. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Again, a very strong quarter. Again, I want to congratulate all of our teams. We are -- as you can see, we are very excited to have the opportunity continue to work on our key priorities and with the opportunities that are related to that. I want to join everybody, of course, on the call in congratulating Sharon and Corie. I know Corie is very much looking forward to meeting all of you and working with all of you. I know Sharon is very much looking forward to introducing -- as a reminder, Sharon is not going away. She's going to be here until the end of the year in an advisory role. She'll introduce Corie to each of the investors and analysts and work with Corie to make this an incredibly seamless transition. It's one of -- it's going to be one of Sharon's legacy -- legacies to have successfully onboarded -- chosen and onboarded and groomed and onboarded Corie. So a very exciting time ahead.

I'll begin today with a review of our second quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So in the second quarter, we delivered better-than-expected Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 versus $0.49 last year, an increase of 16%. These results were due to the strong performance of both our Domestic and International segments. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered comparable sales of 0.8%, which is our guidance of approximately flat. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 3.8% last year. 
We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering a second straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. Similar to last quarter's trends from an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, partially offset by continued softness in mobile phones and gaming. 
Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don't include important categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.2%. We also continue to see considerable year-over-year improvements in our overall Net Promoter Score, which increased approximately 500 basis points over Q2 last year. 
In our International business, strong execution and higher-than-expected sales retention in Canada contributed to revenue growth of 4.1% on a constant currency basis versus our guidance of flat. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 1% versus our guidance of a 5% to 10% decline. 
So altogether, we've delivered a strong first half ahead of our expectations, and I want to thank all of our associates for the focus, passion and work they have put into delivering these results. 
We have also continued to make progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. Our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. 
In home theater, our market-leading customer experience around 4K and large-screen premium technologies in our 79 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store continue to drive sales growth and market share gains. During the quarter, we rolled out 376 new LG experiences in our stores in addition to our existing 660 Samsung and 388  Sony experiences. 
In appliances, we leveraged our 200 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 23rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. We reported 8.2% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 21% in Q2 of last year. 
During the quarter, we implemented a number of improvements to our installation and delivery capabilities, including the ability for online and in-store customers to choose a shorter delivery time window at the point-of-purchase. In the long term, we believe these innovative improvements will contribute to the continued growth of our appliance business. However, they did result in short-term disruptions that negatively impacted this quarter's growth rate. 
In computing, similar to home theater, our partnerships with key vendors, the strength of our market-leading position and our focus on assortment management and solution selling have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. 
In the mobile category, as expected, revenue declined during the first half of the year. We expect this trend to reverse in the second half as anticipated product launches stimulate consumer demand and as we lap the sales declines seen in the category last year. 
In the entertainment category, we have been rolling out virtual reality merchandising. By holiday, we expect to be selling an expanded assortment of virtual reality products in the vast majority of our stores, and more than 500 stores will be equipped with demo stations so customers can try out this exciting new technology. We believe virtual reality has the potential to contribute to our growth in the future, but I'm not expecting any material financial impact this year, given the timing of launches, inventory availability and the fact that we're early in the cycle. 
In services, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increase our Net Promoter Score. As expected, our overall services comparable sales declined during the quarter, due to the carryover effect of the pricing investment we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on our extended warranties. 
We did see less of a sales decline this quarter compared to the past several quarters. And as we begin to anniversary the pricing investment, we expect comparable sales in our services business to be flat to slightly positive in the back half of the year. 
In our online business, our 24% online comparable sales growth was driven by the continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dotcom capabilities. These include, for example, faster shipping, responsive design, a more streamlined checkout process, improved search functionality, better visibility for open box and clearance items and more relevant product recommendations. 
Also, in our mobile app, we have implemented distilled reviews on over 40,000 SKUs. This means customers don't have to wait through hundreds or sometimes thousands of reviews but can instead read a quick summary of the pros and cons of a product. 
In addition, across platforms, we can show customers products that are available -- excuse me, we can show customers products that are available in the store closest to them and show which products are actually displayed in stores near them if they are interested in experiencing the product before they buy. 
Our e-commerce focus has evolved from a phase of building foundations to a phase of driving innovations for our customers, and we're excited about the customer experience improvements still in the pipeline yet for this year. 
In our stores, we are continuing to raise the bar and are seeing continued progress in our ability to deliver on our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology. Given the complexity of technology and the needs of our customers, our stores are a key asset for us. The level of proficiency and engagements of our associates is continuing to increase as affected by the significant increase of our Net Promoter Scores. This is the result of a deliberate and systematic effort to lift the capabilities and performance of each individual associates. This effort includes investment in training and data coaching with a heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills. 
Additionally, we are ensuring that our store general managers and assistant managers are staying in their stores longer, allowing them to be more effective at training, coaching and more broadly leading their teams. We're also improving our store associate retention rates, particularly our -- across our sales roles. We're not done, but the progress is noteworthy and encouraging. 
In our International business, our Canadian transformations is continuing to make good progress. As reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected.
Our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that has been enabled by the consolidation of the 2 brands we had in Canada. Similar to the Domestic business, we are partnering with key vendors to upgrade our Canadian stores. 
Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiency throughout the business. As we stated previously, we do think cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the second quarter, bringing our  current total to $250 million. 
Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
Fiscal '17 is a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are testing several concepts across the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. For example, in a few markets, we are piloting an in-home adviser program, which involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology adviser, who can identify customers' needs, design a personalized solution and become a personal resource over time. In a few other markets, we are testing in-store classes on topics such as digital photography, home automation, maximizing your WiFi and helping parents ensure that their kids have a safe online experience. We're also testing Geek Squad on-demand services, including same day, for customers who need immediate technology help or advice. 
So in summary, we are encouraged by the quality of our execution, the momentum in our business and the strength of our first half financial results, and we are excited by our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology and the growth opportunities this mission and the related customer needs creates for us. Again, I want to thank everyone across the company for their focus, their passion and work to deliver every day on this mission. 
Now I cannot close without mentioning that yesterday, we celebrated our 50th anniversary. 50 years ago to the day, Dick Schulze opened the first Sound of Music store in St. Paul, Minnesota. And so as we celebrate this anniversary, we honor 50 years of innovation. We honor our values, and we honor the individuals who helped build this company. We are also celebrating the future and the opportunity we have to build on our rich history and our values to shape this next chapter of our history and build a company that customers and employees can love and that richly rewards our shareholders. So happy anniversary, Best Buy. 
And now I am very happy to turn the call over to our new CFO, Corie Barry."

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in the Best Buy family for your confidence and continued commitment to our future. I'm thrilled to be a part of this team and feel fortunate to be able to tell our collective story. 
I also want to take a moment to publicly thank Sharon McCollam for the active advisory role she is playing. Her wisdom and advice have been invaluable to me over the past 3.5 years, and she has been instrumental in this transition. Finally, I want to thank Hubert and our board for this opportunity. I look forward to our collective partnership. 
Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by outperformance in the Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to higher gross profit rates and the flow-through of the higher revenue in both businesses. The higher-than-expected gross profit rate in the Domestic business was primarily driven by lower-than-expected negative impacts from our investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high-margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes in April. 
I will now talk about our Q2 results versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, Enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $8.53 billion, primarily due to higher sales retention in Canada and comparable sales growth in the Domestic business. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue increased 0.1%, reflecting approximately 30 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.08 or 16% to $0.57. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year; a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and a $0.02 per share benefit from a lower tax rate. These increases were partially offset by the expected year-over-year pressure in the Domestic business from: one, our investment in services pricing; two, lapping the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment; and three, the inventory availability impact from the Japanese earthquakes that I just mentioned. Collectively, these items resulted in approximately $0.08 of year-over-year pressure versus our expectation of $0.12 to $0.13. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased a greater-than-expected 0.1% to $7.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales of 0.8%, which were partially offset by the loss of revenue from 12 large-format and 22 Best Buy mobile store closures since last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones and gaming. In services, comparable revenue declined 7.2% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.7% to $835 million, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.6% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 4.1% to $644 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 1%, reflecting approximately 510 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 24.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 24%, primarily due to the net negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from lapping the periodic profit-sharing benefit and the extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment in Q2 FY '16, investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high-margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 300 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as the company lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity related to the brand consolidation, which started in Q1 FY '16. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.77 billion or 20.7% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or 30 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.61 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $18 million or 30 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the flow-through of cost reductions, which were partially offset by strategic investments. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $164 million or 25.5% of revenue, a decrease of $6 million or 70 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less cash used to fund additions to property and equipment during the first half of the year compared to $15 million for the first half of last year. While this is due to solid financial results and disciplined working capital management, it is also significantly influenced by the timing of inventory and payable positions. As a reminder, our decision last year to bring holiday inventory in early resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year-end. In Q1 and Q2 of this year, our accounts-payable-to-inventory ratio has increased as expected. 
In the second quarter, we returned $309 million in cash to our shareholders, $219 million through share repurchases and $90 million in regular dividends. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $640 million. Also, during the quarter, S&P returned our debt rating to investment grade. We are now rated investment grade by all 3 of the major rating agencies. 
I would now like to talk about our Q3 guidance and our full year outlook. For our Q3 fiscal 2017 guidance, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion or flat to 1% growth. We anticipate both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales growth of approximately 1%. We expect International revenue to be approximately flat to down 5% on a reported basis and to be approximately flat on a constant-currency basis. We anticipate our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.47, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 319 million and a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 37.5% to 38%. 
As it relates to our full year financial outlook, we are reaffirming our expectation of approximately flat revenue and raising our full year non-GAAP operating income outlook. We continue to expect the slight revenue decline in the first half to be offset by slight growth in the back half. And in light of our first half performance, we are now expecting a full year non-GAAP operating income growth rate in the low single digits versus our previous expectation of approximately flat. This includes lapping the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our previous earnings calls, our full year outlook assumes: one, a relatively better mobile cycle; two, a trend in the NPD-tracked categories consistent with the last 2 quarters; and three, delivering our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And so of course, that's different from the store footprint in the U.S., so difficult to compare. As it relates to -- compared to our expectations, maybe our expectations were too low. But the other thing is that, frankly, our team is executing extremely well, and what the brand consolidation has done is it has unlocked the ability of our teams to invest in the customer experience and do great work for customers.

Thanks for the question, Brian. So we were very clear in calling out some of the very specific pressures to our business in the quarter, namely what we saw happening in services, both from a pricing perspective and from lapping last year's unique profit-sharing benefit; as well as some of the softness we expected in DI. I also just mentioned that we saw a quarter where tablets sequentially was not as low as what we have seen in the prior quarter, and just the mix of that in our business creates a bit of a different profit profile. We've been very clear -- historically, we called it out, I know, in Q1 around our pricing and promotionality, and we've been clear that we're working to be very targeted in where we are promotional and be very thoughtful about what the right drive times are and what the right events are for us. And so I characterize it less as massively more promotional in the quarter and more as a combination of some of these discrete events and a bit of a change in the mix of our business for the quarter."

One, we've been on a journey, and we've talked about it on several of our calls to improve the quality of service around delivery and installation. From an industry standpoint, by the way, this is an area that -- where there's a lot of opportunities, and we've had a strong focus on that, and the progress we've made in the last several quarters has been very, very notable, achieving NPS scores that, frankly, we did not necessarily thought were possible even though quite -- we are far from being where we want to be specifically then as it relates to this quarter. So we introduced a change in our -- we introduced the ability of the customer to choose a narrower delivery window, like 4 hours, at the point of sales, both in stores and online and specifically -- so that's obviously a great benefit from a customer standpoint. Who wants to sit around and wait for the entire day for the appliance to show up? I think we can do a survey on this call, probably no one, and so we are narrowing the delivery window and the ability of the customer to choose. In the very short term, this has led to disruptions. Sometimes, when you introduce innovation, there's some kinks to be worked out. So we're in the process of working them out. We've highlighted that because the growth rate of our appliance business in the quarter of roughly 8% was lower than some of what we still 23 [ph] quarters of consecutive comp sales growth but relatively slower than what we have seen before. I think if we have not had these disruption so okay, so probably we would have been in the double digits growth rate, and we do expect looking ahead that these continued improvement and again we have a long way to go in terms of creating an amazing customer experience for when you buy -- when you shop for and then buy and use appliances that this has now continue to drive our performance."

The stores-within-a-store are very important component of our strategy.

From the customers standpoint, as customers look for solutions around their entertainment needs, their food preparation needs, their productivity needs, their home automation needs, the reality is that you need usually to assemble a solution that takes some various vendors. And the role that Best Buy plays is certainly to showcase the latest and greatest technology, and we show our customers the ability to run about it and experience it, but it's much more than this. It's also to understand the needs of the customer and create a solution that meets their need, and there is an integration need or value-added that exists there. And therefore, that makes it difficult to track or not necessarily meaningful to track the performance of individual stores because of that more crosscutting solution-selling approach. I hope that's helpful answer to your understanding."

I'll begin today with a review of our second quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So in the second quarter, we delivered better-than-expected Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 versus $0.49 last year, an increase of 16%. These results were due to the strong performance of both our Domestic and International segments. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered comparable sales of 0.8%, which is our guidance of approximately flat. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 3.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering a second straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. Similar to last quarter's trends from an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, partially offset by continued softness in mobile phones and gaming. 
Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don't include important categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.2%. We also continue to see considerable year-over-year improvements in our overall Net Promoter Score, which increased approximately 500 basis points over Q2 last year. 
In our International business, strong execution and higher-than-expected sales retention in Canada contributed to revenue growth of 4.1% on a constant-currency basis versus our guidance of flat. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 1% versus our guidance of a 5% to 10% decline. So altogether, we've delivered a strong first half ahead of our expectations, and I want to thank all of our associates for the focus, passion and work they have put into delivering these results. 
We have also continued to make progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. Our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. In home theater, our market-leading customer experience around 4K and large-screen premium technologies in our 79 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store continued to drive sales growth and market share gains. During the quarter, we rolled out 376 new LG experiences in our stores in addition to our existing 660 Samsung and 388 Sony experiences. 
In appliances, we leveraged our 200 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 23rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. We reported 8.2% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 21% in Q2 of last year. During the quarter, we implemented a number of improvements to our installation and delivery capabilities, including the ability for online and in-store customers to choose a shorter delivery time window at the point of purchase. In the long term, we believe these innovative improvements will contribute to the continued growth of our appliance business. However, they did result in short-term disruptions that negatively impacted this quarter's growth rate. 
In computing, similar to home theater, our partnerships with key vendors, the strength of our market-leading position and our focus on assortment management and solution selling have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. 
In the mobile category, as expected, revenue declined during the first half of the year. We expect this trend to reverse in the second half as anticipated product launches stimulate consumer demand and as we lap the sales declines seen in the category last year. 
In the entertainment category, we have been rolling out virtual reality merchandising. By holiday, we expect to be selling an expanded assortment of virtual reality products in the vast majority of our stores, and more than 500 stores will be equipped with demo stations so customers can try out this exciting new technology. We believe virtual reality has the potential to contribute to our growth in the future, but I'm not expecting a material financial impact this year, given the timing of launches, inventory availability and the fact that we are early in the cycle. 
In services, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increase our Net Promoter Score. As expected, overall services comparable sales declined during the quarter due to the carryover effect of the pricing investment we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on our extended warranties. We did see less of a sales decline this quarter compared to the past several quarters, and as we begin to anniversary the pricing investment, we expect comparable sales in our services business to be flat to slightly positive in the back half of the year. 
In our online business, our 24% online comparable sales growth was driven by the continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. These include, for example, faster shipping, responsive design, a more streamlined checkout process, improved search functionality, better visibility for open box and clearance items and more relevant product recommendations. Also, in our mobile app, we have implemented distilled reviews on over 40,000 SKUs. This means customers don't have to wait through hundreds or sometimes thousands of reviews but can instead read a quick summary of the pros and cons of a product. 
In addition, across platforms, we can show customers product that are available -- excuse me, we can show customers products that are available in the store closest to them and show which products are actually displayed in stores near them if they are interested in experiencing the product before they buy. Our e-commerce focus has evolved from a phase of building foundations to a phase of driving innovations for our customers, and we are excited about the customer experience improvements still in the pipeline yet for this year. 
In our stores, we are continuing to raise the bar and are seeing continued progress in our ability to deliver on our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology. Given the complexity of technology and the needs of our customers, our stores are a key asset for us. The level of proficiency and engagements of our associates is continuing to increase as manifested by the significant increase of our Net Promoter Scores. This is the result of a deliberate and systematic effort to lift the capabilities and performance of each individual associate. This effort includes investment in training and daily coaching with a heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills. 
Additionally, we are ensuring that our store general managers and assistant managers are staying in their stores longer, allowing them to be more effective at training, coaching and more broadly leading their teams. We are also improving our store associate retention rates, particularly our -- across our sales roles. We're not done, but the progress is noteworthy and encouraging. 
In our International business, our Canadian transformation is continuing to make good progress. As reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. Our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that has been enabled by the consolidation of the 2 brands we had in Canada. Similar to the Domestic business, we are partnering with key vendors to upgrade our Canadian stores. 
Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiency throughout the business. As we stated previously, we do think cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the second quarter, bringing our  current total to $250 million. 
Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
Fiscal '17 is a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are testing several concepts across the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. For example, in a few markets, we are piloting an in-home adviser program, which involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology adviser, who can identify customers' needs, design a personalized solution and become a personal resource over time. In a few other markets, we are testing in-store classes on topics such as digital photography, home automation, maximizing your WiFi and helping parents ensure that their kids have a safe online experience. We're also testing Geek Squad on-demand services, including same day, for customers who need immediate technology help or advice. 
So in summary, we are encouraged by the quality of our execution, the momentum in our business and the strength of our first half financial results, and we are excited by our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology and the growth opportunities this mission and the related customer needs creates for us. Again, I want to thank everyone across the company for their focus, their passion and work to deliver every day on this mission. 
Now I cannot close without mentioning that yesterday, we celebrated our 50th anniversary. 50 years ago to the day, Dick Schulze opened the first Sound of Music store in St. Paul, Minnesota. And so as we celebrate this anniversary, we honor 50 years of innovation. We honor our values, and we honor the individuals who helped build this company. We are also celebrating the future and the opportunity we have to build on our rich history and our values to shape this next chapter of our history and build a company that customers and employees can love and that richly rewards our shareholders. So happy anniversary, Best Buy. 
And now I am very happy to turn the call over to our new CFO, Corie Barry."

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in the Best Buy family for your confidence and continued commitment to our future. I'm thrilled to be a part of this team and feel fortunate to be able to tell our collective story. 
I also want to take a moment to publicly thank Sharon McCollam for the active advisory role she is playing. Her wisdom and advice have been invaluable to me over the past 3.5 years, and she has been instrumental in this transition. Finally, I want to thank Hubert and our board for this opportunity. I look forward to our collective partnership. 
Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by outperformance in the Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to higher gross profit rates and the flow-through of the higher revenue in both businesses. The higher-than-expected gross profit rate in the Domestic business was primarily driven by lower-than-expected negative impacts from our investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high-margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes in April. 
I will now talk about our Q2 results versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, Enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $8.53 billion, primarily due to higher sales retention in Canada and comparable sales growth in the Domestic business. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue increased 0.1%, reflecting approximately 30 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.08 or 16% to $0.57. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year; a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and a $0.02 per share benefit from a lower tax rate. These increases were partially offset by the expected year-over-year pressure in the Domestic business from: one, our investment in services pricing; two, lapping the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment; and three, the inventory availability impact from the Japanese earthquakes that I just mentioned. Collectively, these items resulted in approximately $0.08 of year-over-year pressure versus our expectation of $0.12 to $0.13. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased a greater-than-expected 0.1% to $7.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales of 0.8%, which were partially offset by the loss of revenue from 12 large-format and 22 Best Buy mobile store closures since last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones and gaming. In services, comparable revenue declined 7.2% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.7% to $835 million, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.6% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 4.1% to $644 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 1%, reflecting approximately 510 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 24.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 24%, primarily due to the net negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from lapping the periodic profit-sharing benefit and the extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment in Q2 FY '16, investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high-margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 300 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as the company lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity related to the brand consolidation, which started in Q1 FY '16. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.77 billion or 20.7% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or 30 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.61 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $18 million or 30 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the flow-through of cost reductions, which were partially offset by strategic investments. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $164 million or 25.5% of revenue, a decrease of $6 million or 70 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less cash used to fund additions to property and equipment during the first half of the year compared to $15 million for the first half of last year. While this is due to solid financial results and disciplined working capital management, it is also significantly influenced by the timing of inventory and payable positions. As a reminder, our decision last year to bring holiday inventory in early resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year-end. In Q1 and Q2 of this year, our accounts-payable-to-inventory ratio has increased as expected. 
In the second quarter, we returned $309 million in cash to our shareholders, $219 million through share repurchases and $90 million in regular dividends. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $640 million. Also, during the quarter, S&P returned our debt rating to investment grade. We are now rated investment grade by all 3 of the major rating agencies. 
I would now like to talk about our Q3 guidance and our full year outlook. For our Q3 fiscal 2017 guidance, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion or flat to 1% growth. We anticipate both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales growth of approximately 1%. We expect International revenue to be approximately flat to down 5% on a reported basis and to be approximately flat on a constant-currency basis. We anticipate our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.47, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 319 million and a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 37.5% to 38%. 
As it relates to our full year financial outlook, we are reaffirming our expectation of approximately flat revenue and raising our full year non-GAAP operating income outlook. We continue to expect the slight revenue decline in the first half to be offset by slight growth in the back half. And in light of our first half performance, we are now expecting a full year non-GAAP operating income growth rate in the low single digits versus our previous expectation of approximately flat. This includes lapping the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our previous earnings calls, our full year outlook assumes: one, a relatively better mobile cycle; two, a trend in the NPD-tracked categories consistent with the last 2 quarters; and three, delivering our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And so of course, that's different from the store footprint in the U.S., so difficult to compare. As it relates to -- compared to our expectations, maybe our expectations were too low. But the other thing is that, frankly, our team is executing extremely well, and what the brand consolidation has done is it has unlocked the ability of our teams to invest in the customer experience and do great work for customers. As you know, Future Shop had a commission-based system in a multi-channel environment with the importance of online. This was limiting some of our abilities.

Let me first say that our outlook for the rest of the year incorporates best forecast for this category as well as all of the other categories.

What is noteworthy is the superior customer experience that we've built around home theater. That's true in the stores from an assortment standpoint, from a merchandising standpoint. The ability to see, touch and experience the products, the expertise that we now have in the stores, in part in partnership with key vendors, all of this is very, very strong. And then we, of course, have online experience and our ability to help customers in the home.

So can you kind of dimensionalize how important that was to the overall Domestic comp and whether that can become even more important as you make your way through the second half?"

So that's a factor, and of course, we're going to lap that in the second half. What I wanted to add is really maybe to deemphasize the focus on the NPD-tracked categories because there's so many exclusions now that it's -- what's convenient with the NPD report is that it's available when we put out earnings, but there's so many exclusions that it's hard to use it as a true spotlight for the performance. So we've provided this again this quarter for convenience. Our real focus is actually on growing the top line more than anything else. So I'm just looking at that one now."

So we've talked multiple times about the profit sharing. You'll continue to see us lapping that in the back half. We are very clear last year about when we saw those different pockets. Additionally, the services pricing pressure, we start to lap the changes that we made to our services portfolio last year about midway through Q3, and so you're going to see that even out a bit. And so I think we've tried to be very clear about what are those structural pieces versus some of the underlying. And keep in mind, we also continue to work on from a waste reduction and efficiency perspective. Remember, that doesn't just impact our SG&A. That is -- also continues to flow through portions of it in our margin line as well.

From an industry standpoint, by the way, this is an area that -- where there is a lot of opportunities, and we've had a strong focus on that. And the progress we've made in the last several quarters has been very, very notable, achieving NPS scores that, frankly, we did not necessarily thought were possible, even though quite -- we are far from being where we want to be specifically then as it relates to this quarter. So we introduced a change in our -- we introduced the ability of the customer to choose a narrower delivery window, like 4 hours, at the point of sales, both in stores and online. And specifically -- so that's obviously a great benefit from a customer standpoint. Who wants to sit around and wait for the entire day for the appliance to show up? I think we can do a survey on this call, probably no one. And so we are narrowing the delivery window and the ability of the customer to choose. In the very short term, this has led to disruptions. Sometimes, when you introduce innovation, there are some kinks to be worked out, so we're in the process of working them out. We've highlighted that because the growth rate of our appliance business in the quarter of roughly 8% was slower than some of what we -- still 23 quarters of consecutive comp sales growth, but relatively slower than what we have seen before. I think if we had not had these disruptions, okay, so probably we would have been in the double-digit growth rate. And we do expect, looking ahead, that this continued improvement -- and again, we have a long way to go in terms of creating an amazing customer experience for when you buy -- when you shop for and then buy and use appliances that this has now continued to drive our performance."

The stores-within-a-store are very important component of our strategy.

From the customers standpoint, as customers look for solutions around their entertainment needs, their food preparation needs, their productivity needs, their home automation needs, the reality is that you need usually to assemble a solution that takes some various vendors. And the role that Best Buy plays is certainly to showcase the latest and greatest technology and make sure customers have the ability to learn about it and experience it, but it's much more than this. It's also to understand the needs of the customer and create a solution that meets their need, and that's -- there's an integration need or value-added that exists there. And therefore, that makes it difficult to track or not necessarily meaningful to track the performance of individual stores because of that more crosscutting solution-selling approach. I hope that's helpful, Alan, to your understanding."

I'll begin today with a review of our second quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities.

I'll begin today with a review of our second quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So in the second quarter, we delivered better-than-expected Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 versus $0.49 last year, an increase of 16%. These results were due to the strong performance of both our Domestic and International segments. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered comparable sales of 0.8%, which is our guidance of approximately flat. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 3.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering a second straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. Similar to last quarter's trends from an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, partially offset by continued softness in mobile phones and gaming. 
Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don't include important categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.2%. We also continue to see considerable year-over-year improvement in our overall Net Promoter Score, which increased approximately 500 basis points over Q2 last year. 
In our International business, strong execution and higher-than-expected sales retention in Canada contributed to revenue growth of 4.1% on a constant-currency basis versus our guidance of flat. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 1% versus our guidance of a 5% to 10% decline. So altogether, we've delivered a strong first half ahead of our expectations, and I want to thank all of our associates for the focus, passion and work they have put into delivering these results. 
We have also continued to make progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. Our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. In home theater, our market-leading customer experience around 4K and large-screen premium technologies in our 79 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store continued to drive sales growth and market share gains. During the quarter, we rolled out 376 new LG Experiences in our stores in addition to our existing 660 Samsung and 388 Sony Experiences. 
In appliances, we leveraged our 200 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 23rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. We reported 8.2% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 21% in Q2 of last year. During the quarter, we implemented a number of improvements to our installation and delivery capabilities, including the ability for online and in-store customers to choose a shorter delivery time window at the point of purchase. In the long term, we believe these innovative improvements will contribute to the continued growth of our appliance business. However, they did result in short-term disruptions that negatively impacted this quarter's growth rate. 
In computing, similar to home theater, our partnerships with key vendors, the strength of our market-leading position and our focus on assortment management and solution selling have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. 
In the mobile category, as expected, revenue declined during the first half of the year. We expect this trend to reverse in the second half as anticipated product launches stimulate consumer demand and as we lap the sales declines seen in the category last year. 
In the entertainment category, we have been rolling out virtual reality merchandising. By holiday, we expect to be selling an expanded assortment of virtual reality products in the vast majority of our stores, and more than 500 stores will be equipped with demo stations so customers can try out this exciting new technology. We believe virtual reality has the potential to contribute to our growth in the future, but I'm not expecting a material financial impact this year, given the timing of launches, inventory availability and the fact that we are early in the cycle. 
In services, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increase our Net Promoter Score. As expected, overall services comparable sales declined during the quarter due to the carryover effect of the pricing investment we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on our extended warranties. We did see less of a sales decline this quarter compared to the past several quarters, and as we begin to anniversary the pricing investment, we expect comparable sales in our services business to be flat to slightly positive in the back half of the year. 
In our online business, our 24% online comparable sales growth was driven by the continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. These include, for example, faster shipping, responsive design, a more streamlined checkout process, improved search functionality, better visibility for open box and clearance items and more relevant product recommendations. Also, in our mobile app, we have implemented distilled reviews on over 40,000 SKUs. This means customers don't have to wade through hundreds or sometimes thousands of reviews but can instead read a quick summary of the pros and cons of a product. 
In addition, across platforms, we can show customers product that are available -- excuse me, we can show customers products that are available in the store closest to them and show which products are actually displayed in stores near them if they are interested in experiencing the product before they buy. Our e-commerce focus has evolved from a phase of building foundations to a phase of driving innovations for our customers, and we are excited about the customer experience improvements still in the pipeline yet for this year. 
In our stores, we are continuing to raise the bar and are seeing continued progress in our ability to deliver on our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology. Given the complexity of technology and the needs of our customers, our stores are a key asset for us. The level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to increase, as manifested by the significant increase of our Net Promoter Scores. This is the result of a deliberate and systematic effort to lift the capabilities and performance of each individual associate. This effort includes investment in training and daily coaching with a heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills. 
Additionally, we are ensuring that our store general managers and assistant managers are staying in their stores longer, allowing them to be more effective at training, coaching and more broadly leading their teams. We are also improving our store associate retention rates, particularly our -- across our sales roles. We're not done, but the progress is noteworthy and encouraging. 
In our International business, our Canadian transformation is continuing to make good progress. As reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. Our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that has been enabled by the consolidation of the 2 brands we had in Canada. Similar to the Domestic business, we are partnering with key vendors to upgrade our Canadian stores. 
Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiency throughout the business. As we have stated previously, we do think cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the second quarter, bringing our current total to $250 million. 
Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
Fiscal '17 is a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are testing several concepts across the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. For example, in a few markets, we are piloting an in-home adviser program, which involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology adviser, who can identify a customer's needs, design a personalized solution and become a personal resource over time. In a few other markets, we are testing in-store classes on topics such as digital photography, home automation, maximizing your WiFi and helping parents ensure that their kids have a safe online experience. We're also testing Geek Squad on-demand services, including same day, for customers who need immediate technology help or advice. 
So in summary, we are encouraged by the quality of our execution, the momentum in our business and the strength of our first half financial results, and we are excited by our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology and the growth opportunities this mission and the related customer needs creates for us. Again, I want to thank everyone across the company for their focus, their passion and work to deliver every day on this mission. 
Now I cannot close without mentioning that yesterday, we celebrated our 50th anniversary. 50 years ago to the day, Dick Schulze opened the first Sound of Music store in St. Paul, Minnesota. And so as we celebrate this anniversary, we honor 50 years of innovation. We honor our values, and we honor the individuals who helped build this company. We are also celebrating the future and the opportunity we have to build on our rich history and our values to shape this next chapter of our history and build a company that customers and employees can love and that richly rewards our shareholders. So happy anniversary, Best Buy. 
And now I am very happy to turn the call over to our new CFO, Corie Barry."

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in the Best Buy family for your confidence and continued commitment to our future. I am thrilled to be a part of this team and feel fortunate to be able to tell our collective story. 
I also want to take a moment to publicly thank Sharon McCollam for the active advisory role she is playing. Her wisdom and advice have been invaluable to me over the past 3.5 years, and she has been instrumental in this transition. Finally, I want to thank Hubert and our board for this opportunity. I look forward to our collective partnership. 
Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by outperformance in the Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to higher gross profit rates and the flow-through of the higher revenue in both businesses. The higher-than-expected gross profit rate in the Domestic business was primarily driven by lower-than-expected negative impacts from our investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high-margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes in April. 
I will now talk about our Q2 results versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, Enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $8.53 billion, primarily due to higher sales retention in Canada and comparable sales growth in the Domestic business. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue increased 0.1%, reflecting approximately 30 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.08 or 16% to $0.57. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year; a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and a $0.02 per share benefit from a lower tax rate. These increases were partially offset by the expected year-over-year pressure in the Domestic business from: one, our investment in services pricing; two, lapping the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment; and three, the inventory availability impact from the Japanese earthquakes that I just mentioned. Collectively, these items resulted in approximately $0.08 of year-over-year pressure versus our expectation of $0.12 to $0.13. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased a greater-than-expected 0.1% to $7.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales of 0.8%, which were partially offset by the loss of revenue from 12 large-format and 22 Best Buy mobile store closures since last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones and gaming. In services, comparable revenue declined 7.2% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.7% to $835 million, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.6% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 4.1% to $644 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 1%, reflecting approximately 510 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 24.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 24%, primarily due to the net negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from lapping the periodic profit-sharing benefit and the extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment in Q2 FY '16, investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high-margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 300 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as the company lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity related to the brand consolidation, which started in Q1 FY '16. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.77 billion or 20.7% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or 30 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.61 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $18 million or 30 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the flow-through of cost reductions, which were partially offset by strategic investments. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $164 million or 25.5% of revenue, a decrease of $6 million or 70 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less cash used to fund additions to property and equipment during the first half of the year compared to $15 million for the first half of last year. While this is due to solid financial results and disciplined working capital management, it is also significantly influenced by the timing of inventory and payable positions. As a reminder, our decision last year to bring holiday inventory in early resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year-end. In Q1 and Q2 of this year, our accounts-payable-to-inventory ratio has increased as expected. 
In the second quarter, we returned $309 million in cash to our shareholders, $219 million through share repurchases and $90 million in regular dividends. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $640 million. Also during the quarter, S&P returned our debt rating to investment grade. We are now rated investment grade by all 3 of the major rating agencies. 
I would now like to talk about our Q3 guidance and our full year outlook. For our Q3 fiscal 2017 guidance, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion or flat to 1% growth. We anticipate both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales growth of approximately 1%. We expect International revenue to be approximately flat to down 5% on a reported basis and to be approximately flat on a constant-currency basis. We anticipate our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.47, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 319 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 37.5% to 38%. 
As it relates to our full year financial outlook, we are reaffirming our expectation of approximately flat revenue and raising our full year non-GAAP operating income outlook. We continue to expect the slight revenue decline in the first half to be offset by slight growth in the back half. And in light of our first half performance, we are now expecting a full year non-GAAP operating income growth rate in the low single digits versus our previous expectation of approximately flat. This includes lapping the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our previous earnings calls, our full year outlook assumes: one, a relatively better mobile cycle; two, a trend in the NPD-tracked categories consistent with the last 2 quarters; and three, delivering our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives.

But the other thing is that, frankly, our team is executing extremely well. And what the brand consolidation has done is it has unlocked the ability of our teams to invest in the customer experience and do great work for customers.

And specifically -- so that's obviously a great benefit from a customer standpoint. Who wants to sit around and wait for the entire day for the appliance to show up?

We've highlighted that because the growth rate of our appliance business in the quarter of roughly 8% was slower than some of what we -- still 23 quarters of consecutive comp sales growth, but relatively slower than what we have seen before. I think if we had not had these disruptions, okay, so probably we would have been in the double-digit growth rate. And we do expect, looking ahead, that these continued improvements -- and again, we have a long way to go in terms of creating an amazing customer experience for when you buy -- when you shop for and then buy and use appliances that this is going to continue to drive our performance."

The stores-within-a-store are a very important component of our strategy. But as Corie said, like online, it's hard to isolate because what we are is much more than a collection of stores-within-a-store. From a customer standpoint, as customers look for solutions around their entertainment needs, their food preparation needs, their productivity needs, their home automation needs, the reality is that you need usually to assemble a solution that takes from various vendors. And the role that Best Buy plays is certainly to showcase the latest and greatest technology and make sure customers have the ability to learn about it and experience it, but it's much more than this. It's also to understand the needs of the customer and create a solution that meets their need, and that's -- there is an integration need or value-added that exists there. And therefore, that makes it difficult to track or not necessarily meaningful to track the performance of individual stores because of that more crosscutting solution-selling approach.

I'll begin today with a review of our second quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So in the second quarter, we delivered better-than-expected Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 versus $0.49 last year, an increase of 16%. These results were due to the strong performance of both our Domestic and International segments. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered comparable sales of 0.8%, which is our guidance of approximately flat. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 3.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering a second straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. Similar to last quarter's trends from an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, partially offset by continued softness in mobile phones and gaming. 
Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don't include important categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.2%. We also continue to see considerable year-over-year improvement in our overall Net Promoter Score, which increased approximately 500 basis points over Q2 last year. 
In our International business, strong execution and higher-than-expected sales retention in Canada contributed to revenue growth of 4.1% on a constant-currency basis versus our guidance of flat. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 1% versus our guidance of a 5% to 10% decline. So altogether, we've delivered a strong first half ahead of our expectations, and I want to thank all of our associates for the focus, passion and work they have put into delivering these results. 
We have also continued to make progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. Our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. In home theater, our market-leading customer experience around 4K and large-screen premium technologies in our 79 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store continued to drive sales growth and market share gains. During the quarter, we rolled out 376 new LG Experiences in our stores in addition to our existing 660 Samsung and 388 Sony Experiences. 
In appliances, we leveraged our 200 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 23rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. We reported 8.2% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 21% in Q2 of last year. During the quarter, we implemented a number of improvements to our installation and delivery capabilities, including the ability for online and in-store customers to choose a shorter delivery time window at the point of purchase. In the long term, we believe these innovative improvements will contribute to the continued growth of our appliance business. However, they did result in short-term disruptions that negatively impacted this quarter's growth rate. 
In computing, similar to home theater, our partnerships with key vendors, the strength of our market-leading position and our focus on assortment management and solution selling have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. 
In the mobile category, as expected, revenue declined during the first half of the year. We expect this trend to reverse in the second half as anticipated product launches stimulate consumer demand and as we lap the sales declines seen in the category last year. 
In the entertainment category, we have been rolling out virtual reality merchandising. By holiday, we expect to be selling an expanded assortment of virtual reality products in the vast majority of our stores, and more than 500 stores will be equipped with demo stations so customers can try out this exciting new technology. We believe virtual reality has the potential to contribute to our growth in the future, but I'm not expecting a material financial impact this year, given the timing of launches, inventory availability and the fact that we are early in the cycle. 
In services, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increase our Net Promoter Score. As expected, overall services comparable sales declined during the quarter due to the carryover effect of the pricing investment we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on our extended warranties. We did see less of a sales decline this quarter compared to the past several quarters, and as we begin to anniversary the pricing investment, we expect comparable sales in our services business to be flat to slightly positive in the back half of the year. 
In our online business, our 24% online comparable sales growth was driven by the continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. These include, for example, faster shipping, responsive design, a more streamlined checkout process, improved search functionality, better visibility for open box and clearance items and more relevant product recommendations. Also, in our mobile app, we have implemented distilled reviews on over 40,000 SKUs. This means customers don't have to wade through hundreds or sometimes thousands of reviews but can instead read a quick summary of the pros and cons of a product. 
In addition, across platforms, we can show customers product that are available -- excuse me, we can show customers products that are available in the store closest to them and show which products are actually displayed in stores near them if they are interested in experiencing the product before they buy. Our e-commerce focus has evolved from a phase of building foundations to a phase of driving innovations for our customers, and we are excited about the customer experience improvements still in the pipeline yet for this year. 
In our stores, we are continuing to raise the bar and are seeing continued progress in our ability to deliver on our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology. Given the complexity of technology and the needs of our customers, our stores are a key asset for us. The level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to increase, as manifested by the significant increase of our Net Promoter Scores. This is the result of a deliberate and systematic effort to lift the capabilities and performance of each individual associate. This effort includes investment in training and daily coaching with a heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills. 
Additionally, we are ensuring that our store general managers and assistant managers are staying in their stores longer, allowing them to be more effective at training, coaching and more broadly leading their teams. We are also improving our store associate retention rates, particularly our -- across our sales roles. We're not done, but the progress is noteworthy and encouraging. 
In our International business, our Canadian transformation is continuing to make good progress. As reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. Our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that has been enabled by the consolidation of the 2 brands we had in Canada. Similar to the Domestic business, we are partnering with key vendors to upgrade our Canadian stores. 
Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiency throughout the business. As we have stated previously, we do think cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the second quarter, bringing our current total to $250 million. 
Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
Fiscal '17 is a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are testing several concepts across the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. For example, in a few markets, we are piloting an in-home adviser program, which involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology adviser, who can identify a customer's needs, design a personalized solution and become a personal resource over time. In a few other markets, we are testing in-store classes on topics such as digital photography, home automation, maximizing your WiFi and helping parents ensure that their kids have a safe online experience. We're also testing Geek Squad on-demand services, including same day, for customers who need immediate technology help or advice. 
So in summary, we are encouraged by the quality of our execution, the momentum in our business and the strength of our first half financial results, and we are excited by our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology and the growth opportunities this mission and the related customer needs creates for us. Again, I want to thank everyone across the company for their focus, their passion and work to deliver every day on this mission. 
Now I cannot close without mentioning that yesterday, we celebrated our 50th anniversary. 50 years ago to the day, Dick Schulze opened the first Sound of Music store in St. Paul, Minnesota. And so as we celebrate this anniversary, we honor 50 years of innovation. We honor our values, and we honor the individuals who helped build this company. We are also celebrating the future and the opportunity we have to build on our rich history and our values to shape this next chapter of our history and build a company that customers and employees can love and that richly rewards our shareholders. So happy anniversary, Best Buy. 
And now I am very happy to turn the call over to our new CFO, Corie Barry."

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in the Best Buy family for your confidence and continued commitment to our future. I am thrilled to be a part of this team and feel fortunate to be able to tell our collective story. 
I also want to take a moment to publicly thank Sharon McCollam for the active advisory role she is playing. Her wisdom and advice have been invaluable to me over the past 3.5 years, and she has been instrumental in this transition. Finally, I want to thank Hubert and our board for this opportunity. I look forward to our collective partnership. 
Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by outperformance in the Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to higher gross profit rates and the flow-through of the higher revenue in both businesses. The higher-than-expected gross profit rate in the Domestic business was primarily driven by lower-than-expected negative impacts from our investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high-margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes in April. 
I will now talk about our Q2 results versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, Enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $8.53 billion, primarily due to higher sales retention in Canada and comparable sales growth in the Domestic business. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue increased 0.1%, reflecting approximately 30 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.08 or 16% to $0.57. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year; a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and a $0.02 per share benefit from a lower tax rate. These increases were partially offset by the expected year-over-year pressure in the Domestic business from: one, our investment in services pricing; two, lapping the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment; and three, the inventory availability impact from the Japanese earthquakes that I just mentioned. Collectively, these items resulted in approximately $0.08 of year-over-year pressure versus our expectation of $0.12 to $0.13. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased a greater-than-expected 0.1% to $7.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales of 0.8%, which were partially offset by the loss of revenue from 12 large-format and 22 Best Buy mobile store closures since last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones and gaming. In services, comparable revenue declined 7.2% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.7% to $835 million, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.6% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 4.1% to $644 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 1%, reflecting approximately 510 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 24.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 24%, primarily due to the net negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from lapping the periodic profit-sharing benefit and the extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment in Q2 FY '16, investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high-margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 300 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as the company lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity related to the brand consolidation, which started in Q1 FY '16. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.77 billion or 20.7% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or 30 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.61 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $18 million or 30 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the flow-through of cost reductions, which were partially offset by strategic investments. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $164 million or 25.5% of revenue, a decrease of $6 million or 70 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 
From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less cash used to fund additions to property and equipment during the first half of the year compared to $15 million for the first half of last year. While this is due to solid financial results and disciplined working capital management, it is also significantly influenced by the timing of inventory and payable positions. As a reminder, our decision last year to bring holiday inventory in early resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year-end. In Q1 and Q2 of this year, our accounts-payable-to-inventory ratio has increased as expected. 
In the second quarter, we returned $309 million in cash to our shareholders, $219 million through share repurchases and $90 million in regular dividends. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $640 million. Also during the quarter, S&P returned our debt rating to investment grade. We are now rated investment grade by all 3 of the major rating agencies. 
I would now like to talk about our Q3 guidance and our full year outlook. For our Q3 fiscal 2017 guidance, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion or flat to 1% growth. We anticipate both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales growth of approximately 1%. We expect International revenue to be approximately flat to down 5% on a reported basis and to be approximately flat on a constant-currency basis. We anticipate our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.47, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 319 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 37.5% to 38%. 
As it relates to our full year financial outlook, we are reaffirming our expectation of approximately flat revenue and raising our full year non-GAAP operating income outlook. We continue to expect the slight revenue decline in the first half to be offset by slight growth in the back half. And in light of our first half performance, we are now expecting a full year non-GAAP operating income growth rate in the low single digits versus our previous expectation of approximately flat. This includes lapping the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our previous earnings calls, our full year outlook assumes: one, a relatively better mobile cycle; two, a trend in the NPD-tracked categories consistent with the last 2 quarters; and three, delivering our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives.

And so of course, that's different from the store footprint in the U.S., so difficult to compare. As it relates to -- compared to our expectations, maybe our expectations were too low. But the other thing is that, frankly, our team is executing extremely well. And what the brand consolidation has done is it has unlocked the ability of our teams to invest in the customer experience and do great work for customers. As you know, Future Shop had a commission-based system. In a multi-channel environment with the importance of online this was limiting some of our abilities. And so, I think great execution, kudos, really impressive performance on the part of our Canadian team. You have to give credit to -- where credit is due."

So we've provided this again this quarter for convenience. Our real focus is actually on growing the top line more than anything else. So I'll just leave it at that for now."

So we've talked multiple times about the profit sharing. You'll continue to see us lapping that in the back half. We were very clear last year about when we saw those different pockets. Additionally, the services pricing pressure, we start to lap the changes that we made to our services portfolio last year about midway through Q3, and so you're going to see that even out a bit. And so I think we've tried to be very clear about what are those structural pieces versus some of the underlying. And keep in mind, we also continue to work on from a waste reduction and efficiency perspective. Remember, that doesn't just impact our SG&A. That is -- also continues to flow through portions of it in our margin line as well. And so yes, there's some puts and takes there, but we're trying to be very clear about what are kind of the larger events that we're lapping year-over-year versus some of the just more structural baselines."

From an industry standpoint, by the way, this is an area that -- where there is a lot of opportunities, and we've had a strong focus on that. And the progress we've made in the last several quarters has been very, very notable, achieving NPS scores that, frankly, we did not necessarily -- thought were possible, even though quite -- we are far from being where we want to be. Specifically, then, as it relates to this quarter, so we introduced a change in our -- we introduced the ability of the customer to choose a narrower delivery window, like 4 hours, at the point of sales, both in stores and online. And specifically -- so that's obviously a great benefit from a customer standpoint. Who wants to sit around and wait for the entire day for the appliance to show up? I think we can do a survey on this call, probably no one. And so we are narrowing the delivery window and the ability of the customer to choose. In the very short term, this has led to disruptions. Sometimes, when you introduce innovation, there are some kinks to be worked out, so we're in the process of working them out. We've highlighted that because the growth rate of our appliance business in the quarter of roughly 8% was slower than some of what we -- still 23 quarters of consecutive comp sales growth, but relatively slower than what we have seen before. I think if we had not had these disruptions, okay, so probably we would have been in the double-digit growth rate. And we do expect, looking ahead, that these continued improvements -- and again, we have a long way to go in terms of creating an amazing customer experience for when you buy -- when you shop for and then buy and use appliances that this is going to continue to drive our performance."

From a customer standpoint, as customers look for solutions around their entertainment needs, their food preparation needs, their productivity needs, their home automation needs, the reality is that you need usually to assemble a solution that takes from various vendors. And the role that Best Buy plays is certainly to showcase the latest and greatest technology and make sure customers have the ability to learn about it and experience it, but it's much more than this. It's also to understand the needs of the customer and create a solution that meets their need, and that's -- there is an integration need or value-added that exists there. And therefore, that makes it difficult to track or not necessarily meaningful to track the performance of individual stores because of that more crosscutting solution-selling approach. I hope that's helpful, Alan, to your understanding."

I'll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities before turning the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. 
We are pleased to report today growth on both our top and bottom lines with Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion, an increase of 1.4%, and non-GAAP EPS increasing 51% from $0.41 last year to $0.62 this year. These results were due to the strong performance in both our Domestic and International segments. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered comparable sales growth of 1.8%. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 0.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering the third straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. 
From an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in home theater, mobile and emerging categories like wearables and Connected Home. This was offset by continued softness in gaming. We also continue to drive considerable year-over-year improvement in our Net Promoter Score, which increased approximately 400 basis points over Q3 last year. 
In our International business, revenue grew 4% on a constant-currency basis. On a reported basis, International revenue increased 3.3%. Altogether, we have delivered another strong quarter, which reflects the strength of our value proposition and our execution, and I want to thank all of our associates for their dedication and hard work in achieving these results. I am, and I hope they are, proud of what they've accomplished. 
Now before I go into more details on our third quarter performance, I would like to address the recent highly publicized product recalls in mobile phones and appliances. As you would expect, they did have a negative impact on the third quarter, particularly during October. We expect the magnitude of the impact to be more material in the fourth quarter as the impact will be on the entire quarter in Q4 versus only a part of the quarter in Q3. 
As we looked at our revenue guidance, we had to incorporate the fact that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally planned. The expected impact of these recalls on our fourth quarter Domestic revenue is approximately $200 million. With that incorporated, we are planning to deliver comparable sales in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. Still, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to increase by 6% to 9% versus last year. 
Now I'd like to update you on the third quarter progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. The first priority is to build on our industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business. We are pleased with our progress here as we are driving growth across multiple areas of our business. 
In home theater, we continue to grow sales and market share due to the strength of our Magnolia Design Centers, continued success of our vendor experiences and strong performance online. We believe we have built a market-leading customer experience around home theater and large-screen TVs based on our assortments, our merchandising, our online experience, the expertise of our in-store sales associates and, of course, our ability to help customers in their home. The combination of new technology and declining ASPs has been driving growth and interest in the TV category. We offer a unique experience in assortment to our customers, including 4K ultra-high definition televisions with high dynamic range, OLED televisions and a variety of other emerging technologies. 
Also, our strategy at Best Buy is not just about selling TVs. It is about helping customers with their entertainment needs, driving growth in audio, streaming devices and other accessories as well as delivery and installation. We are excited about the continued television product innovation being introduced to the market, and we believe advances in picture quality, content availability and smart home integration will continue to drive excitement and demands in the industry. This plays to our strengths as the technology and service leader in the category. 
We've also delivered revenue growth during the quarter in the mobile category. As expected, new product launches stimulated demand during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by the well-publicized issues with the Samsung Note7, which has been recalled and is no longer being produced or sold. As a result, the mobile category performed better than last year but not as strong as our expectations heading into the quarter. 
Our strategy to win in this category is in part focused on our ability to be an advocate for every phone owner. Our Blue Shirts have the tools and training to analyze customers' current phone plans and their actual needs and then recommend the right plan at the right cost. They can also recommend hardware upgrades, add family members to existing plans and fill entirely new family plans. Using these tools, we found that at least 50% of customers are able to save money on their monthly mobile plan. 
Also, we've increased our AT&T and Verizon stores-within-a-store to 426 from 247 at the end of last year. In support of our strategy, these vendor experiences feature highly trained specialists who provide access to the carrier's products, services and detailed customer information and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. 
We also drove growth in several emerging product categories. We are as excited as ever about the role that technology can play in peoples' lives and the opportunity this creates for us. Emerging categories are getting traction in part due to our ability to physically showcase products and offer expert help to customers. 
In Connected Home, we're seeing strength in home automation, including security, lighting and video monitoring. Drones are also becoming a more meaningful part of the business, and virtual reality products hit all of our stores during the third quarter with new, dedicated virtual reality departments in more than 700 stores. These new departments will offer demo stations, virtual reality products, PC gaming devices and accessories. Since we first began offering in-store demos, customers have experienced approximately 300,000 virtual reality demos at Best Buy. 
In appliances, we leverage our 203 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 24th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. We reported 3% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 16.4% in Q3 of last year. Our growth decelerated late in the quarter due in part to product recalls and shipping delays that resulted in constrained inventory with key vendors. 
In services, as expected, our comparable sales trend improved significantly in the third quarter as we began to lap the pricing investments made last year, and we are seeing higher attach rates and revenue growth from new products we introduced. In addition, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our Net Promoter Score. We expect comparable sales in our services business to be slightly positive in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to our digital channel. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of 24% Domestic online sales growth. This growth was driven by increased traffic and the cumulative benefit of our investments over the past few years in the digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. We continue to refine our search, research and checkout capabilities with a focus on streamlining the customer experience across all channels. 
For example, a new feature that can filter product search results by local store availability is resonating with customers as it makes their shopping journey a little easier. In addition to helping [ph] customers after their purchase, we're piloting product support pages which provide customers information about the products they've purchased, including transaction details, product specs, Geek Squad plans and quick access to expert help. 
We also launched a pilot in the Best Buy Mobile app that allows customers to book 30-minute, in-person appointments to consult with Blue Shirt experts. 
In our physical stores, we've continued the momentum from the investments we've made in training and coaching from the reduced employee turnover that we discussed last quarter. Heading into the holiday season and the fourth quarter, we have armed an increasing number of associates with tablets that allow them to look at product and customer information and transact. Also, we are investing additional labor around key holiday product categories where customers need more help and in the fast-growing in-store pickup area. 
In our International business, we recorded strong top and bottom line results in both Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we are seeing positive early results from the new store redesigns we have developed in partnership with key vendors, and we are also pleased with the growth of our services business there and excited by the lessons we are learning as a result. 
I'll now turn to our second fiscal 2017 priority, which is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 target of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2018, we achieved another $50 million in the third quarter. This brings our current total to $300 million in annualized cost reductions and gross-profit optimization. As a result of our successful focus on driving out costs, we are able this year to improve the customer experience while maintaining flat SG&A. 
Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we believe we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
As we've stated before, fiscal 2017 is a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are testing several concepts across -- around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. Based on early results, we've expanded both the in-home adviser program and the Geek Squad on-demand pilots to additional markets. 
The in-home adviser program pilot involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology adviser who can identify a customer's needs, design a personal solution and become a personal resource over time. Geek Squad on-demand pilots provide services to customers who need immediate technology help or advice, including same day. 
We also recently launched a new program called Magnolia Care to provide ongoing support and troubleshooting for the comprehensive custom home theater solutions we provide to our Magnolia Design Center clients. Also, in Canada, we are testing a new service called Geek Squad home membership that provides support for all of the technology products the customer may own, regardless of whether they were bought at Best Buy. On the Connected Home front, we are testing different merchandising concepts like creating displays with actual front-door experiences to demonstrate front-door security solutions. 
So in summary, we are excited by the continued industry product innovation we are seeing, the role we play for customers, the growth opportunities in front of us, the quality of our execution and the strength of our financial performance. Looking ahead, our teams are ready to execute our plan for the holiday season. As our marketing tagline, Holiday Gifting Made Easy, states, our goal is to make holiday shopping effortless for customers. To win holiday and deliver on this promise, we have created an exciting assortment of great and competitively priced products, and we've mobilized our assets, including our leading-edge digital capabilities, fast and free shipping across the entire site during holiday and, of course, our knowledgeable Blue Shirt and Geek Squad agents who are here to provide compelling in-store experiences and in-home services. 
And so in closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates and their families for everything they will do this holiday to delight our customers. I say to our associates, ""You are Best Buy, and I appreciate you very, very much."" 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry."
255397,405159697,1088390,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectat",989,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by outperformance in the Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the higher gross profit rates in both businesses and lower-than-expected SG&A in the Domestic business. 
I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, Enterprise revenue increased 1.5% to $8.95 billion, primarily due to comparable sales growth in the Domestic business and the continuation of the strong performance we've seen in International throughout this year. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue increased 1.4%, reflecting approximately 10 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.21 or 51% to $0.62. This increase was primarily driven by, one, a higher gross profit rate and the flow-through of higher revenue in the Domestic business; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, Canada, which, as of the end of Q3, has now lapped the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased a greater-than-expected 1.3% to $8.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.8%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 14 large-format and 23 Best Buy Mobile store closures. 
Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don't include categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.1%. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in home theater, mobile phone, wearables and Connected Home was partially offset by declines in gaming. 
In services, the comparable revenue decline of 1.8% moderated, as expected, as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. The decline in services revenue during the quarter was entirely due to the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven primarily by lower frequency of claims on extended warranty. 
Domestic online revenue of $881 million increased 24.1% on a comparable basis, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.8% versus 8.8% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 4% to $753 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, International revenue increased 3.3%, reflecting approximately 70 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 24.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 60 basis points due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories, which were partially offset by the mobile category. 
Unlike Q2 of this year, we did not see year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate from the investments in services pricing or a periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 190 basis points to 24.3%, driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to a more favorable product mix and lapping the disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity last year related to the brand consolidation. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.88 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $18 million. However, the Enterprise revenue increase resulted in leverage of 10 basis points. 
Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.71 billion or 20.9% of revenue, an increase of $20 million. This increase was primarily driven by the timing of previously outlined investments. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $169 million or 22.4% of revenue, a decline of $2 million, driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 110 basis points of SG&A rate decline were driven by sales leverage. 
In the third quarter, we returned $290 million in cash to our shareholders, $201 million through share repurchases and $89 million in regular dividend. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $931 million. 
I would now like to talk about our fourth quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter, as we execute our holiday plans, which includes a disciplined promotional strategy, we expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.62 to $1.67 compared to $1.53 last year. This outlook assumes a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 315 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 35% to 35.5%. 
Note that our revenue and EPS expectations include approximately $30 million or $0.06 of net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio that we received in the fourth quarter of last year. 
From a revenue standpoint, we are excited by the rate of technology innovations, the quality of our assortment and our ability to execute. As Hubert said earlier, we also need to factor in our projections the impact of recent product recalls that happened in the last few months and that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally expected. The impact of the recalls on Q4 is expected to be approximately $200 million. With this incorporated, our Enterprise revenue expectation is $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. Underlying our Enterprise performance is Domestic comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% and International comparable sales in the range of negative 2% to positive 2%. 
Lastly, I want to take one final opportunity to remind everyone that, as we announced earlier this year, we will no longer be doing a holiday sales release in early January due to the growing importance of that month to our Q4 financial results. We look forward to talking to you in February on our Q4 call. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

The customer experience we provide, a combination of assortment, merchandising, the online experience, the experience in the stores, our service capabilities, these are allowing us to continue to gain market share. These market share gains have slightly moderated as -- because it's hard to continue forever, but we have built a capability that's quite unique. The other thing that we want to highlight, and we've talked about it, I think, on previous calls, this cycle or this time is different from the time where TVs went to digital and it was a much more contained cycle. We see continued product innovation today and coming in the future, and this continued product innovation allows us to appeal to the type of customers that we appeal to, which are in part the leading-edge and early adopters, provide this great experience and allows us to stay ahead of the game. So we're not surrendering by any stretch of the imagination. I think there's been some words around this. We're in the game to win, and we're very proud of the capabilities we have."

Remember, we talked a bit about single SKU and the ability to buy the phone across multiple carriers. That means we had a better supply of inventory, had more inventory that was available for customers, so that means quicker sell-through early on. And so we're watching it now to look at the trends that implies going out -- we like where the trends are holding up right now. And typically, as we watch the cycle, it obviously tails as you go through the year, but it usually is -- when people want the phone, it's a cycle that continues.

To your question about kind of elaborate on the replacement cycle, Hubert has started on it. The truth is, yes, there is definitely a repair aspect, but the phone still can be repaired. And if you are quite loyal to both the operating system and the size of your phone, which we are seeing people be loyal to, then you might be more willing to go through some of the repair work and wait for whatever else might be coming. So we actually aren't seeing a ton of people move into other devices. It seems like people are pretty loyal to that combination of operating system and size that's offered and was offered by the Note."

The -- so on TVs, if you break down the industry and our business by TV size, you see a very different picture, and this is an important point to highlight because it's not just about 4Ks and OLED TVs. It's very much about large-screen TVs. And the customer demand is gravitating, of course, towards these larger-screen TVs, and the competitive landscape is different by TV size. So our customers and the experience we provide gravitate towards the higher -- the larger screens and the more fully featured TVs and not just 4Ks. Again, you have this new innovation with HDR and OLED. So that is playing to our strength. So that dynamic is helping us, okay? And in a sense, we're also helping to create dynamics with our merchandising efforts, our online efforts, our in-store efforts, is allowing us to create that excitement about these more fully featured, larger-screen TVs. I think computing remains a very important strength for us. This is another case where the industry is not doing great, frankly, from a top line standpoint. And it's a combination of the assortment, the creation of a premium, more fully featured exclusive assortments on the Windows side and a strong presence with Apple. The great experience in the stores, in partnership with our key vendors, has really made us a great destination, great customer experience, great market share and evolution of the market. So this is a case where, in partnership with our vendors, in everything we can do, we are helping drive the market and the better outcomes. So these are exciting categories. And looking at Q4, from a demand standpoint, there is potential excitement with both existing categories and then, of course, these new emerging categories because, of course, these ways of growth, and there is, indeed, this year quite a bit of innovation."

Additionally, we've talked about our ability to take out cost, especially around some of our reverse logistics, and we're also seeing some of that benefit our profit rates there. That, however, was also offset by a little bit of a decline in the mobile category, where we also have some mixed challenges there. The other thing that I would note is as you compared to the second quarter and you think sequentially about what's happened in profit, we did not see material pressure from the investments in services pricing or the periodic profit-sharing benefit, and so you can -- took those pressures away and then saw this bit better result around some of that mix and assortment, and it was very, very helpful to our overall margin rate. And then in terms of your question about do we see some of this going forward, obviously, we have confidence in our expertise and our strategies and our merchandising elements. I always am thoughtful around Q4, which is such a very different competitive quarter than the rest of the year, and so the guidance that we're giving you incorporates where we think we are positioned to provide the very best value and very best experiences to our customers.

Black Friday, I think until the game is played, it's hard to know, but we do see a combination of a bit of spreading out but also peaks and valleys being higher and steeper as the consumer has been trained to shop when it's -- the prices are more promotional. So I don't think that there is a material change here. From a product standpoint, I think what's exciting this year is that there's a broad range of exciting categories across what I would characterize as some of our more traditional product categories like, for example, TVs and computing. The new TVs are just extraordinary. In computing, our teams have done a great job as well as these emerging categories. So around Connected Home, around wearable, around drones, around virtual reality. There's many reasons to come and check our products. Portable audio, there's also headphones, there's some really cool new headphones. I'm personally so excited by my personal holiday shopping. I have to disclose I'm going to buy a new drone.

And so we're really working hard to ensure that we understand all those operational components. We like the experiences we're learning about in the home. It reinforces, I think, for us this idea that there's a lot of technology. It continues to evolve very rapidly, but there is confusion once people have it in their homes in terms of not just how to use it. This isn't just about broken, it's also about how do I do the most with it and actually understand how to take it to the next level. And then when I'm comfortable doing the most with it, I'm often more likely to investigate and play with more things in my home. So we like the things that we're learning.

I'll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities before turning the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. 
We are pleased to report today growth on both our top and bottom lines with Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion, an increase of 1.4%, and non-GAAP EPS increasing 51% from $0.41 last year to $0.62 this year. These results were due to the strong performance in both our Domestic and International segments. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered comparable sales growth of 1.8%. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 0.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering the third straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. 
From an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in home theater, mobile and emerging categories like wearables and Connected Home. This was offset by continued softness in gaming. We also continue to drive considerable year-over-year improvement in our Net Promoter Score, which increased approximately 400 basis points over Q3 last year. 
In our International business, revenue grew 4% on a constant-currency basis. On a reported basis, International revenue increased 3.3%. Altogether, we have delivered another strong quarter, which reflects the strength of our value proposition and our execution, and I want to thank all of our associates for their dedication and hard work in achieving these results. I am, and I hope they are, proud of what they've accomplished. 
Now before I go into more details on our third quarter performance, I would like to address the recent highly publicized product recalls in mobile phones and appliances. As you would expect, they did have a negative impact on the third quarter, particularly during October. We expect the magnitude of the impact to be more material in the fourth quarter as the impact will be on the entire quarter in Q4 versus only a part of the quarter in Q3. 
As we looked at our revenue guidance, we had to incorporate the fact that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally planned. The expected impact of these recalls on our fourth quarter Domestic revenue is approximately $200 million. With that incorporated, we are planning to deliver comparable sales in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. Still, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to increase by 6% to 9% versus last year. 
Now I'd like to update you on the third quarter progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. The first priority is to build on our industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business. We are pleased with our progress here as we are driving growth across multiple areas of our business. 
In home theater, we continue to grow sales and market share due to the strength of our Magnolia Design Centers, continued success of our vendor experiences and strong performance online. We believe we have built a market-leading customer experience around home theater and large-screen TVs based on our assortments, our merchandising, our online experience, the expertise of our in-store sales associates and, of course, our ability to help customers in their home. The combination of new technology and declining ASPs has been driving growth and interest in the TV category. We offer a unique experience in assortment to our customers, including 4K ultra-high definition televisions with high dynamic range, OLED televisions and a variety of other emerging technologies. 
Also, our strategy at Best Buy is not just about selling TVs. It is about helping customers with their entertainment needs, driving growth in audio, streaming devices and other accessories as well as delivery and installation. We are excited about the continued television product innovation being introduced to the market, and we believe advances in picture quality, content availability and smart home integration will continue to drive excitement and demands in the industry. This plays to our strengths as the technology and service leader in the category. 
We've also delivered revenue growth during the quarter in the mobile category. As expected, new product launches stimulated demand during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by the well-publicized issues with the Samsung Note7, which has been recalled and is no longer being produced or sold. As a result, the mobile category performed better than last year but not as strong as our expectations heading into the quarter. 
Our strategy to win in this category is in part focused on our ability to be an advocate for every phone owner. Our Blue Shirts have the tools and training to analyze customers' current phone plans and their actual needs and then recommend the right plan at the right cost. They can also recommend hardware upgrades, add family members to existing plans and fill entirely new family plans. Using these tools, we found that at least 50% of customers are able to save money on their monthly mobile plan. 
Also, we've increased our AT&T and Verizon stores-within-a-store to 426 from 247 at the end of last year. In support of our strategy, these vendor experiences feature highly trained specialists who provide access to the carrier's products, services and detailed customer information and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. 
We also drove growth in several emerging product categories. We are as excited as ever about the role that technology can play in peoples' lives and the opportunity this creates for us. Emerging categories are getting traction in part due to our ability to physically showcase products and offer expert help to customers. 
In Connected Home, we're seeing strength in home automation, including security, lighting and video monitoring. Drones are also becoming a more meaningful part of the business, and virtual reality products hit all of our stores during the third quarter with new, dedicated virtual reality departments in more than 700 stores. These new departments will offer demo stations, virtual reality products, PC gaming devices and accessories. Since we first began offering in-store demos, customers have experienced approximately 300,000 virtual reality demos at Best Buy. 
In appliances, we leverage our 203 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 24th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. We reported 3% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 16.4% in Q3 of last year. Our growth decelerated late in the quarter due in part to product recalls and shipping delays that resulted in constrained inventory with key vendors. 
In services, as expected, our comparable sales trend improved significantly in the third quarter as we began to lap the pricing investments made last year, and we are seeing higher attach rates and revenue growth from new products we introduced. In addition, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our Net Promoter Score. We expect comparable sales in our services business to be slightly positive in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to our digital channel. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of 24% Domestic online sales growth. This growth was driven by increased traffic and the cumulative benefit of our investments over the past few years in the digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. We continue to refine our search, research and checkout capabilities with a focus on streamlining the customer experience across all channels. 
For example, a new feature that can filter product search results by local store availability is resonating with customers as it makes their shopping journey a little easier. In addition to helping customers after their purchase, we're piloting product support pages which provide customers information about the products they've purchased, including transaction details, product specs, Geek Squad plans and quick access to expert help. 
We also launched a pilot in the Best Buy Mobile app that allows customers to book 30-minute, in-person appointments to consult with Blue Shirt experts. 
In our physical stores, we've continued the momentum from the investments we've made in training and coaching from the reduced employee turnover that we discussed last quarter. Heading into the holiday season and the fourth quarter, we have armed an increasing number of associates with tablets that allow them to look at product and customer information and transact. Also, we are investing additional labor around key holiday product categories where customers need more help and in the fast-growing in-store pickup area. 
In our International business, we recorded strong top and bottom line results in both Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we are seeing positive early results from the new store redesigns we have developed in partnership with key vendors, and we are also pleased with the growth of our services business there and excited by the lessons we are learning as a result. 
I'll now turn to our second fiscal 2017 priority, which is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 target of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2018, we achieved another $50 million in the third quarter. This brings our current total to $300 million in annualized cost reductions and gross-profit optimization. As a result of our successful focus on driving out costs, we are able this year to improve the customer experience while maintaining flat SG&A. 
Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we believe we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
As we've stated before, fiscal 2017 is a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are testing several concepts across -- around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. Based on early results, we've expanded both the in-home adviser program and the Geek Squad on-demand pilots to additional markets. 
The in-home adviser program pilot involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology adviser who can identify a customer's needs, design a personal solution and become a personal resource over time. Geek Squad on-demand pilots provide services to customers who need immediate technology help or advice, including same day. 
We also recently launched a new program called Magnolia Care to provide ongoing support and troubleshooting for the comprehensive custom home theater solutions we provide to our Magnolia Design Center clients. Also, in Canada, we are testing a new service called Geek Squad home membership that provides support for all of the technology products the customer may own, regardless of whether they were bought at Best Buy. On the Connected Home front, we are testing different merchandising concepts like creating displays with actual front-door experiences to demonstrate front-door security solutions. 
So in summary, we are excited by the continued industry product innovation we are seeing, the role we play for customers, the growth opportunities in front of us, the quality of our execution and the strength of our financial performance. Looking ahead, our teams are ready to execute our plan for the holiday season. As our marketing tagline, Holiday Gifting Made Easy, states, our goal is to make holiday shopping effortless for customers. To win holiday and deliver on this promise, we have created an exciting assortment of great and competitively priced products, and we've mobilized our assets, including our leading-edge digital capabilities, fast and free shipping across the entire site during holiday and, of course, our knowledgeable Blue Shirt and Geek Squad agents who are here to provide compelling in-store experiences and in-home services. 
And so in closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates and their families for everything they will do this holiday to delight our customers. I say to our associates, ""You are Best Buy, and I appreciate you very, very much."" 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry."
255397,405159697,1088477,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectat",989,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by outperformance in the Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the higher gross profit rates in both businesses and lower-than-expected SG&A in the Domestic business. 
I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, Enterprise revenue increased 1.5% to $8.95 billion, primarily due to comparable sales growth in the Domestic business and the continuation of the strong performance we've seen in International throughout this year. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue increased 1.4%, reflecting approximately 10 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.21 or 51% to $0.62. This increase was primarily driven by, one, a higher gross profit rate and the flow-through of higher revenue in the Domestic business; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, Canada, which, as of the end of Q3, has now lapped the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased a greater-than-expected 1.3% to $8.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.8%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 14 large-format and 23 Best Buy Mobile store closures. 
Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don't include categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.1%. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in home theater, mobile phone, wearables and Connected Home was partially offset by declines in gaming. 
In services, the comparable revenue decline of 1.8% moderated, as expected, as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. The decline in services revenue during the quarter was entirely due to the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven primarily by lower frequency of claims on extended warranty. 
Domestic online revenue of $881 million increased 24.1% on a comparable basis, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.8% versus 8.8% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 4% to $753 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, International revenue increased 3.3%, reflecting approximately 70 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 24.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 60 basis points due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories, which were partially offset by the mobile category. 
Unlike Q2 of this year, we did not see year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate from the investments in services pricing or a periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 190 basis points to 24.3%, driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to a more favorable product mix and lapping the disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity last year related to the brand consolidation. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.88 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $18 million. However, the Enterprise revenue increase resulted in leverage of 10 basis points. 
Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.71 billion or 20.9% of revenue, an increase of $20 million. This increase was primarily driven by the timing of previously outlined investments. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $169 million or 22.4% of revenue, a decline of $2 million, driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 110 basis points of SG&A rate decline were driven by sales leverage. 
In the third quarter, we returned $290 million in cash to our shareholders, $201 million through share repurchases and $89 million in regular dividend. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $931 million. 
I would now like to talk about our fourth quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter, as we execute our holiday plans, which includes a disciplined promotional strategy, we expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.62 to $1.67 compared to $1.53 last year. This outlook assumes a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 315 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 35% to 35.5%. 
Note that our revenue and EPS expectations include approximately $30 million or $0.06 of net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio that we received in the fourth quarter of last year. 
From a revenue standpoint, we are excited by the rate of technology innovations, the quality of our assortment and our ability to execute. As Hubert said earlier, we also need to factor in our projections the impact of recent product recalls that happened in the last few months and that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally expected. The impact of the recalls on Q4 is expected to be approximately $200 million. With this incorporated, our Enterprise revenue expectation is $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. Underlying our Enterprise performance is Domestic comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% and International comparable sales in the range of negative 2% to positive 2%. 
Lastly, I want to take one final opportunity to remind everyone that, as we announced earlier this year, we will no longer be doing a holiday sales release in early January due to the growing importance of that month to our Q4 financial results. We look forward to talking to you in February on our Q4 call. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Remember, we talked a bit about single SKU and the ability to buy the phone across multiple carriers. That means we had a better supply of inventory, had more inventory that was available for customers, so that means quicker sell-through early on. And so we're watching it now to look at the trends that implies going out -- we like where the trends are holding up right now. And typically, as we watch the cycle, it obviously tails as you go through the year, but it usually is -- when people want the phone, it's a cycle that continues.

To your question about kind of elaborate on the replacement cycle, Hubert has started on it. The truth is, yes, there is definitely a repair aspect, but the phone still can be repaired. And if you are quite loyal to both the operating system and the size of your phone, which we are seeing people be loyal to, then you might be more willing to go through some of the repair work and wait for whatever else might be coming. So we actually aren't seeing a ton of people move into other devices.

It's very much about large-screen TVs. And the customer demand is gravitating, of course, towards these larger-screen TVs, and the competitive landscape is different by TV size. So our customers and the experience we provide gravitate towards the higher -- the larger screens and the more fully featured TVs and not just 4Ks. Again, you have this new innovation with HDR and OLED. So that is playing to our strength. So that dynamic is helping us, okay? And in a sense, we're also helping to create dynamics with our merchandising efforts, our online efforts, our in-store efforts, is allowing us to create that excitement about these more fully featured, larger-screen TVs. I think computing remains a very important strength for us. This is another case where the industry is not doing great, frankly, from a top line standpoint. And it's a combination of the assortment, the creation of a premium, more fully featured exclusive assortments on the Windows side and a strong presence with Apple. The great experience in the stores, in partnership with our key vendors, has really made us a great destination, great customer experience, great market share and evolution of the market. So this is a case where, in partnership with our vendors, in everything we can do, we are helping drive the market and the better outcomes. So these are exciting categories.

So let's talk about gross profit a little bit. So what we saw in both home theater and computing is really reflective of a little bit of what Hubert hit on, which is around kind of our mix, our assortment, our merchandising strategies and then absolutely, to the last part of your question, some of that ability to have the basket due to the sales expertise that we have in our stores. Additionally, we've talked about our ability to take out costs, especially around some of our reverse logistics, and we're also seeing some of that benefit our profit rates there. That, however, was also offset by a little bit of a decline in the mobile category, where we also have some mix challenges there. The other thing that I would note is, as you compare to the second quarter and you think sequentially about what's happened in profit, we did not see material pressure from the investments in services pricing or the periodic profit-share benefit. And so you kind of took those pressures away and then saw this bit better result around some of that mix and assortment, and it was very, very helpful to our overall margin rate. And then in terms of your question about do we see some of this going forward, the -- obviously, we have confidence in our expertise, in our strategies, in our merchandising element. I always am thoughtful around Q4, which is such a very different competitive quarter than the rest of the year. And so the guidance that we're giving you incorporates where we think we are positioned to provide the very best value and very best experiences to our customers. And then also, obviously, Q4, you have to take into account what I hit on before, which is the 25 basis points of pressure from that periodic profit share lapping from last year."

So is the promotional environment this year likely to be more subdued? Short answer is no.

So there's some -- from time to time, there will be aggressive promotions on their behalf, oftentimes with limited quantities, but it creates a -- so no, we cannot see any change from that standpoint. Black Friday, I think with -- until the game is played, it's hard to know. But we do see a combination of a bit of spreading out but also peaks and valleys being higher and steeper as the consumer has been trained to shop when it's -- the prices are more promotional. So I don't think that there is a material change here. From a product standpoint, I think what's exciting this year is that there's a broad range of exciting categories across what I would characterize as some of our more traditional product categories like, for example, TVs and computing. The new TVs are just extraordinary. In computing, our teams have done a great job. As well as these emerging categories, so around Connected Home, around wearable, around drones, around virtual reality. There's many reasons to come and check our products. Portable audio, there is also headphones. There's some really cool new headphones. I mean I'm personally so excited about my personal holiday shopping. I have to disclose I'm going to buy a new drone. I bought one last year, but I'm going to buy a new one. This is exciting."

To your question about in-home adviser, I'll give a little color. And if Hubert would like to add any, he's more than welcome. So obviously, we noted that we're at least rolling out to one more market. It's still very early. In a test like this, obviously, it takes time not just from an understanding results perspective but also just from learning for us, expertise, training and ensuring we have seamless handoffs between our stores and the in-home experience. And so we're really working hard to ensure that we understand all those operational components. We like the experiences we're learning about in the home. It reinforces, I think, for us, this idea that there's a lot of technology, it continues to evolve very rapidly, but there is confusion, once people have it in their homes, in terms of not just how to use it. This isn't just about broken, it's also about, ""How do I do the most with it and actually understand how to take it to the next level?"" And then when I'm comfortable doing the most with it, I'm often more likely to investigate and play with more things in my home. So we like the things that we're learning. You can tell we're taking a very measured approach to making sure that if we're going to do this, we do it right, and we have a lot of confidence in the value prop. That being said, at this point, the teams are incredibly focused on delivering holiday and all the intricacies that go with that.

I'll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities before turning the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. 
We are pleased to report today growth on both our top and bottom lines with Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion, an increase of 1.4%, and non-GAAP EPS increasing 51% from $0.41 last year to $0.62 this year. These results were due to the strong performance in both our Domestic and International segments. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered comparable sales growth of 1.8%. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 0.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering the third straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. 
From an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in home theater, mobile and emerging categories like wearables and Connected Home. This was offset by continued softness in gaming. We also continue to drive considerable year-over-year improvement in our Net Promoter Score, which increased approximately 400 basis points over Q3 last year. 
In our International business, revenue grew 4% on a constant-currency basis. On a reported basis, International revenue increased 3.3%. Altogether, we have delivered another strong quarter, which reflects the strength of our value proposition and our execution, and I want to thank all of our associates for their dedication and hard work in achieving these results. I am, and I hope they are, proud of what they've accomplished. 
Now before I go into more details on our third quarter performance, I would like to address the recent highly publicized product recalls in mobile phones and appliances. As you would expect, they did have a negative impact on the third quarter, particularly during October. We expect the magnitude of the impact to be more material in the fourth quarter as the impact will be on the entire quarter in Q4 versus only a part of the quarter in Q3. 
As we looked at our revenue guidance, we had to incorporate the fact that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally planned. The expected impact of these recalls on our fourth quarter Domestic revenue is approximately $200 million. With that incorporated, we are planning to deliver comparable sales in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. Still, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to increase by 6% to 9% versus last year. 
Now I'd like to update you on the third quarter progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. The first priority is to build on our industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business. We are pleased with our progress here as we are driving growth across multiple areas of our business. 
In home theater, we continue to grow sales and market share due to the strength of our Magnolia Design Centers, continued success of our vendor experiences and strong performance online. We believe we have built a market-leading customer experience around home theater and large-screen TVs based on our assortments, our merchandising, our online experience, the expertise of our in-store sales associates and, of course, our ability to help customers in their home. The combination of new technology and declining ASPs has been driving growth and interest in the TV category. We offer a unique experience and assortment to our customers, including 4K ultra-high definition televisions with high dynamic range, OLED televisions and a variety of other emerging technologies. 
Also, our strategy at Best Buy is not just about selling TVs. It is about helping customers with their entertainment needs, driving growth in audio, streaming devices and other accessories as well as delivery and installation. We are excited about the continued television product innovation being introduced to the market, and we believe advances in picture quality, content availability and smart home integration will continue to drive excitement and demands in the industry. This plays to our strengths as the technology and service leader in the category. 
We've also delivered revenue growth during the quarter in the mobile category. As expected, new product launches stimulated demand during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by the well-publicized issues with the Samsung Note7, which has been recalled and is no longer being produced or sold. As a result, the mobile category performed better than last year but not as strong as our expectations heading into the quarter. 
Our strategy to win in this category is in part focused on our ability to be an advocate for every phone owner. Our Blue Shirts have the tools and training to analyze customers' current phone plans and their actual needs and then recommend the right plan at the right cost. They can also recommend hardware upgrades, add family members to existing plans and fill entirely new family plans. Using these tools, we found that at least 50% of customers are able to save money on their monthly mobile plan. 
Also, we've increased our AT&T and Verizon stores-within-a-store to 426 from 247 at the end of last year. In support of our strategy, these vendor experiences feature highly trained specialists who provide access to the carrier's products, services and detailed customer information and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. 
We also drove growth in several emerging product categories. We are as excited as ever about the role that technology can play in peoples' lives and the opportunity this creates for us. Emerging categories are getting traction in part due to our ability to physically showcase products and offer expert help to customers. 
In Connected Home, we're seeing strength in home automation, including security, lighting and video monitoring. Drones are also becoming a more meaningful part of the business, and virtual reality products hit all of our stores during the third quarter with new, dedicated virtual reality departments in more than 700 stores. These new departments will offer demo stations, virtual reality products, PC gaming devices and accessories. Since we first began offering in-store demos, customers have experienced approximately 300,000 virtual reality demos at Best Buy. 
In appliances, we leverage our 203 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 24th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. We reported 3% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 16.4% in Q3 of last year. Our growth decelerated late in the quarter due in part to product recalls and shipping delays that resulted in constrained inventory with key vendors. 
In services, as expected, our comparable sales trend improved significantly in the third quarter as we began to lap the pricing investments made last year, and we are seeing higher attach rates and revenue growth from new products we introduced. In addition, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our Net Promoter Score. We expect comparable sales in our services business to be slightly positive in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to our digital channel. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of 24% Domestic online sales growth. This growth was driven by increased traffic and the cumulative benefit of our investments over the past few years in the digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. We continue to refine our search, research and checkout capabilities with a focus on streamlining the customer experience across all channels. 
For example, a new feature that can filter product search results by local store availability is resonating with customers as it makes their shopping journey a little easier. In addition to help customers after their purchase, we're piloting product support pages, which provide customers information about the products they've purchased, including transaction details, product specs, Geek Squad plans and quick access to expert help. 
We also launched a pilot in the Best Buy Mobile app that allows customers to book 30-minute, in-person appointments to consult with Blue Shirt experts. 
In our physical stores, we've continued the momentum from the investments we've made in training and coaching from the reduced employee turnover that we discussed last quarter. Heading into the holiday season and the fourth quarter, we have armed an increasing number of associates with tablets that allow them to look at product and customer information and transact. Also, we are investing additional labor around key holiday product categories where customers need more help and in the fast-growing, in-store pickup area. 
In our International business, we recorded strong top and bottom line results in both Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we are seeing positive early results from the new store redesigns we have developed in partnership with key vendors, and we are also pleased with the growth of our services business there and excited by the lessons we are learning as a result. 
I'll now turn to our second fiscal 2017 priority, which is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 target of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2018, we achieved another $50 million in the third quarter. This brings our current total to $300 million in annualized cost reductions and gross-profit optimization. As a result of our successful focus on driving out costs, we are able this year to improve the customer experience while maintaining flat SG&A. 
Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we believe we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
As we've stated before, fiscal 2017 is a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are testing several concepts across -- around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. Based on early results, we've expanded both the in-home adviser program and the Geek Squad on-demand pilots to additional markets. 
The in-home adviser program pilot involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology adviser who can identify a customer's needs, design a personal solution and become a personal resource over time. Geek Squad on-demand pilots provide services to customers who need immediate technology help or advice, including same day. 
We also recently launched a new program called Magnolia Care to provide ongoing support and troubleshooting for the comprehensive custom home theater solutions we provide to our Magnolia Design Center clients. Also, in Canada, we are testing a new service called Geek Squad home membership that provides support for all of the technology products the customer may own, regardless of whether they were bought at Best Buy. On the Connected Home front, we are testing different merchandising concepts like creating displays with actual front-door experiences to demonstrate front-door security solutions. 
So in summary, we are excited by the continued industry product innovation we are seeing, the role we play for customers, the growth opportunities in front of us, the quality of our execution and the strength of our financial performance. Looking ahead, our teams are ready to execute our plan for the holiday season. As our marketing tagline, Holiday Gifting Made Easy, states, our goal is to make holiday shopping effortless for customers. To win holiday and deliver on this promise, we have created an exciting assortment of great and competitively priced products, and we've mobilized our assets, including our leading-edge digital capabilities, fast and free shipping across the entire site during holiday and, of course, our knowledgeable Blue Shirt and Geek Squad agents who are here to provide compelling in-store experiences and in-home services. 
And so in closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates and their families for everything they will do this holiday to delight our customers. I say to our associates, ""You are Best Buy, and I appreciate you very, very much."" 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry."
255397,405159697,1088753,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectat",989,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by outperformance in the Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the higher gross profit rates in both businesses and lower-than-expected SG&A in the Domestic business. 
I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, Enterprise revenue increased 1.5% to $8.95 billion, primarily due to comparable sales growth in the Domestic business and the continuation of the strong performance we've seen in International throughout this year. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue increased 1.4%, reflecting approximately 10 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.21 or 51% to $0.62. This increase was primarily driven by, one, a higher gross profit rate and the flow-through of higher revenue in the Domestic business; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, Canada, which, as of the end of Q3, has now lapped the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased a greater-than-expected 1.3% to $8.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.8%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 14 large-format and 23 Best Buy Mobile store closures. 
Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don't include categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.1%. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in home theater, mobile phone, wearables and Connected Home was partially offset by declines in gaming. 
In services, the comparable revenue decline of 1.8% moderated, as expected, as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. The decline in services revenue during the quarter was entirely due to the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven primarily by lower frequency of claims on extended warranty. 
Domestic online revenue of $881 million increased 24.1% on a comparable basis, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.8% versus 8.8% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 4% to $753 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, International revenue increased 3.3%, reflecting approximately 70 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 24.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 60 basis points due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories, which were partially offset by the mobile category. 
Unlike Q2 of this year, we did not see year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate from the investments in services pricing or a periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 190 basis points to 24.3%, driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to a more favorable product mix and lapping the disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity last year related to the brand consolidation. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.88 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $18 million. However, the Enterprise revenue increase resulted in leverage of 10 basis points. 
Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.71 billion or 20.9% of revenue, an increase of $20 million. This increase was primarily driven by the timing of previously outlined investments. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $169 million or 22.4% of revenue, a decline of $2 million, driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 110 basis points of SG&A rate decline were driven by sales leverage. 
In the third quarter, we returned $290 million in cash to our shareholders, $201 million through share repurchases and $89 million in regular dividend. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $931 million. 
I would now like to talk about our fourth quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter, as we execute our holiday plans, which includes a disciplined promotional strategy, we expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.62 to $1.67 compared to $1.53 last year. This outlook assumes a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 315 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 35% to 35.5%. 
Note that our revenue and EPS expectations include approximately $30 million or $0.06 of net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio that we received in the fourth quarter of last year. 
From a revenue standpoint, we are excited by the rate of technology innovations, the quality of our assortment and our ability to execute. As Hubert said earlier, we also need to factor in our projections the impact of recent product recalls that happened in the last few months and that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally expected. The impact of the recalls on Q4 is expected to be approximately $200 million. With this incorporated, our Enterprise revenue expectation is $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. Underlying our Enterprise performance is Domestic comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% and International comparable sales in the range of negative 2% to positive 2%. 
Lastly, I want to take one final opportunity to remind everyone that, as we announced earlier this year, we will no longer be doing a holiday sales release in early January due to the growing importance of that month to our Q4 financial results. We look forward to talking to you in February on our Q4 call. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

These market share gains have slightly moderated as -- because it's hard to continue forever, but we have built a capability that's quite unique. The other thing that we want to highlight, and we've talked about it, I think, on previous calls, this cycle or this time is different from the time where TVs went to digital and it was a much more contained cycle. We see continued product innovation today and coming in the future, and this continued product innovation allows us to appeal to the type of customers that we appeal to, which are in part the leading-edge and early adopters, provide this great experience and allows us to stay ahead of the game. So we're not surrendering by any stretch of the imagination. I think there's been some words around this. We're in the game to win, and we're very proud of the capabilities we have."

Remember, we talked a bit about single SKU and the ability to buy the phone across multiple carriers. That means we had a better supply of inventory, had more inventory that was available for customers, so that means quicker sell-through early on. And so we're watching it now to look at the trends that implies going out -- we like where the trends are holding up right now. And typically, as we watch the cycle, it obviously tails as you go through the year, but it usually is -- when people want the phone, it's a cycle that continues.

To your question about kind of elaborate on the replacement cycle, Hubert has started on it. The truth is, yes, there is definitely a repair aspect, but the phone still can be repaired. And if you are quite loyal to both the operating system and the size of your phone, which we are seeing people be loyal to, then you might be more willing to go through some of the repair work and wait for whatever else might be coming. So we actually aren't seeing a ton of people move into other devices.

So our customers and the experience we provide gravitate towards the higher -- the larger screens and the more fully featured TVs and not just 4Ks. Again, you have this new innovation with HDR and OLED. So that is playing to our strength. So that dynamic is helping us, okay? And in a sense, we're also helping to create dynamics with our merchandising efforts, our online efforts, our in-store efforts, is allowing us to create that excitement about these more fully featured, larger-screen TVs. I think computing remains a very important strength for us. This is another case where the industry is not doing great, frankly, from a top line standpoint. And it's a combination of the assortment, the creation of a premium, more fully featured exclusive assortments on the Windows side and a strong presence with Apple. The great experience in the stores, in partnership with our key vendors, has really made us a great destination, great customer experience, great market share and evolution of the market.

And I had a follow-up."

The -- as we focus on solving problems for customers and providing solutions, we are adding a services dimension to these discussions so that we can provide an end-to-end seamless experience and support to customers. So that's an area where we are exploring this. I can't talk about specifics here because we are -- it's an infomercial opportunity. We are an Apple service provider -- authorized service provider, and we have a pilot with Samsung on in-store repair for the phones and the tablets. And so again, providing a -- if you have a Samsung product, we are the only place where you can actually go to get this. And of course, Apple have got their own stores, but we have a very significant footprint. Also, collaboration, upstream in product design is something that is a great capability that we have, and we're able to work with some key vendors upstream to together create a winning strategy for our common customers. And so being a player in -- the North American market is such an important market for these vendors, and Best Buy being a leading-edge player in that creates a unique opportunity to create something very compelling for customers.

Additionally, we've talked about our ability to take out costs, especially around some of our reverse logistics, and we're also seeing some of that benefit our profit rates there. That, however, was also offset by a little bit of a decline in the mobile category, where we also have some mix challenges there. The other thing that I would note is, as you compare to the second quarter and you think sequentially about what's happened in profit, we did not see material pressure from the investments in services pricing or the periodic profit-share benefit. And so you kind of took those pressures away and then saw this bit better result around some of that mix and assortment, and it was very, very helpful to our overall margin rate. And then in terms of your question about do we see some of this going forward, the -- obviously, we have confidence in our expertise, in our strategies, in our merchandising element. I always am thoughtful around Q4, which is such a very different competitive quarter than the rest of the year.

Black Friday, I think with -- until the game is played, it's hard to know. But we do see a combination of a bit of spreading out but also peaks and valleys being higher and steeper as the consumer has been trained to shop when it's -- the prices are more promotional. So I don't think that there is a material change here. From a product standpoint, I think what's exciting this year is that there's a broad range of exciting categories across what I would characterize as some of our more traditional product categories like, for example, TVs and computing. The new TVs are just extraordinary. In computing, our teams have done a great job. As well as these emerging categories, so around Connected Home, around wearable, around drones, around virtual reality. There's many reasons to come and check our products. Portable audio, there is also headphones. There's some really cool new headphones. I mean I'm personally so excited about my personal holiday shopping.

To your question about in-home adviser, I'll give a little color. And if Hubert would like to add any, he's more than welcome. So obviously, we noted that we're at least rolling out to one more market. It's still very early. In a test like this, obviously, it takes time not just from an understanding results perspective but also just from learning for us, expertise, training and ensuring we have seamless handoffs between our stores and the in-home experience. And so we're really working hard to ensure that we understand all those operational components. We like the experiences we're learning about in the home. It reinforces, I think, for us, this idea that there's a lot of technology, it continues to evolve very rapidly, but there is confusion, once people have it in their homes, in terms of not just how to use it. This isn't just about broken, it's also about, ""How do I do the most with it and actually understand how to take it to the next level?"" And then when I'm comfortable doing the most with it, I'm often more likely to investigate and play with more things in my home. So we like the things that we're learning. You can tell we're taking a very measured approach to making sure that if we're going to do this, we do it right, and we have a lot of confidence in the value prop. That being said, at this point, the teams are incredibly focused on delivering holiday and all the intricacies that go with that.

I'll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities before turning the call over to Corie for ad",2031,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we're making against our fiscal 2017 priorities before turning the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. 
We are pleased to report today growth on both our top and bottom lines with Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion, an increase of 1.4%, and non-GAAP EPS increasing 51% from $0.41 last year to $0.62 this year. These results were due to the strong performance in both our Domestic and International segments. 
In our Domestic business, we delivered comparable sales growth of 1.8%. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 0.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering the third straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. 
From an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in home theater, mobile and emerging categories like wearables and Connected Home. This was offset by continued softness in gaming. We also continue to drive considerable year-over-year improvement in our Net Promoter Score, which increased approximately 400 basis points over Q3 last year. 
In our International business, revenue grew 4% on a constant-currency basis. On a reported basis, International revenue increased 3.3%. Altogether, we have delivered another strong quarter, which reflects the strength of our value proposition and our execution, and I want to thank all of our associates for their dedication and hard work in achieving these results. I am, and I hope they are, proud of what they've accomplished. 
Now before I go into more details on our third quarter performance, I would like to address the recent highly publicized product recalls in mobile phones and appliances. As you would expect, they did have a negative impact on the third quarter, particularly during October. We expect the magnitude of the impact to be more material in the fourth quarter as the impact will be on the entire quarter in Q4 versus only a part of the quarter in Q3. 
As we looked at our revenue guidance, we had to incorporate the fact that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally planned. The expected impact of these recalls on our fourth quarter Domestic revenue is approximately $200 million. With that incorporated, we are planning to deliver comparable sales in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. Still, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to increase by 6% to 9% versus last year. 
Now I'd like to update you on the third quarter progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. The first priority is to build on our industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business. We are pleased with our progress here as we are driving growth across multiple areas of our business. 
In home theater, we continue to grow sales and market share due to the strength of our Magnolia Design Centers, continued success of our vendor experiences and strong performance online. We believe we have built a market-leading customer experience around home theater and large-screen TVs based on our assortments, our merchandising, our online experience, the expertise of our in-store sales associates and, of course, our ability to help customers in their home. The combination of new technology and declining ASPs has been driving growth and interest in the TV category. We offer a unique experience and assortment to our customers, including 4K ultra-high definition televisions with high dynamic range, OLED televisions and a variety of other emerging technologies. 
Also, our strategy at Best Buy is not just about selling TVs. It is about helping customers with their entertainment needs, driving growth in audio, streaming devices and other accessories as well as delivery and installation. We are excited about the continued television product innovation being introduced to the market, and we believe advances in picture quality, content availability and smart home integration will continue to drive excitement and demands in the industry. This plays to our strengths as the technology and service leader in the category. 
We've also delivered revenue growth during the quarter in the mobile category. As expected, new product launches stimulated demand during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by the well-publicized issues with the Samsung Note7, which has been recalled and is no longer being produced or sold. As a result, the mobile category performed better than last year but not as strong as our expectations heading into the quarter. 
Our strategy to win in this category is in part focused on our ability to be an advocate for every phone owner. Our Blue Shirts have the tools and training to analyze customers' current phone plans and their actual needs and then recommend the right plan at the right cost. They can also recommend hardware upgrades, add family members to existing plans and fill entirely new family plans. Using these tools, we found that at least 50% of customers are able to save money on their monthly mobile plan. 
Also, we've increased our AT&T and Verizon stores-within-a-store to 426 from 247 at the end of last year. In support of our strategy, these vendor experiences feature highly trained specialists who provide access to the carrier's products, services and detailed customer information and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. 
We also drove growth in several emerging product categories. We are as excited as ever about the role that technology can play in peoples' lives and the opportunity this creates for us. Emerging categories are getting traction in part due to our ability to physically showcase products and offer expert help to customers. 
In Connected Home, we're seeing strength in home automation, including security, lighting and video monitoring. Drones are also becoming a more meaningful part of the business, and virtual reality products hit all of our stores during the third quarter with new, dedicated virtual reality departments in more than 700 stores. These new departments will offer demo stations, virtual reality products, PC gaming devices and accessories. Since we first began offering in-store demos, customers have experienced approximately 300,000 virtual reality demos at Best Buy. 
In appliances, we leverage our 203 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 24th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. We reported 3% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 16.4% in Q3 of last year. Our growth decelerated late in the quarter due in part to product recalls and shipping delays that resulted in constrained inventory with key vendors. 
In services, as expected, our comparable sales trend improved significantly in the third quarter as we began to lap the pricing investments made last year, and we are seeing higher attach rates and revenue growth from new products we introduced. In addition, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our Net Promoter Score. We expect comparable sales in our services business to be slightly positive in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to our digital channel. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of 24% Domestic online sales growth. This growth was driven by increased traffic and the cumulative benefit of our investments over the past few years in the digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. We continue to refine our search, research and checkout capabilities with a focus on streamlining the customer experience across all channels. 
For example, a new feature that can filter product search results by local store availability is resonating with customers as it makes their shopping journey a little easier. In addition to help customers after their purchase, we're piloting product support pages, which provide customers information about the products they've purchased, including transaction details, product specs, Geek Squad plans and quick access to expert help. 
We also launched a pilot in the Best Buy Mobile app that allows customers to book 30-minute, in-person appointments to consult with Blue Shirt experts. 
In our physical stores, we've continued the momentum from the investments we've made in training and coaching from the reduced employee turnover that we discussed last quarter. Heading into the holiday season and the fourth quarter, we have armed an increasing number of associates with tablets that allow them to look at product and customer information and transact. Also, we are investing additional labor around key holiday product categories where customers need more help and in the fast-growing, in-store pickup area. 
In our International business, we recorded strong top and bottom line results in both Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we are seeing positive early results from the new store redesigns we have developed in partnership with key vendors, and we are also pleased with the growth of our services business there and excited by the lessons we are learning as a result. 
I'll now turn to our second fiscal 2017 priority, which is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 target of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2018, we achieved another $50 million in the third quarter. This brings our current total to $300 million in annualized cost reductions and gross-profit optimization. As a result of our successful focus on driving out costs, we are able this year to improve the customer experience while maintaining flat SG&A. 
Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we believe we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. 
As we've stated before, fiscal 2017 is a year of exploration and experimentation, and we are testing several concepts across -- around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. Based on early results, we've expanded both the in-home adviser program and the Geek Squad on-demand pilots to additional markets. 
The in-home adviser program pilot involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology adviser who can identify a customer's needs, design a personal solution and become a personal resource over time. Geek Squad on-demand pilots provide services to customers who need immediate technology help or advice, including same day. 
We also recently launched a new program called Magnolia Care to provide ongoing support and troubleshooting for the comprehensive custom home theater solutions we provide to our Magnolia Design Center clients. Also, in Canada, we are testing a new service called Geek Squad home membership that provides support for all of the technology products the customer may own, regardless of whether they were bought at Best Buy. On the Connected Home front, we are testing different merchandising concepts like creating displays with actual front-door experiences to demonstrate front-door security solutions. 
So in summary, we are excited by the continued industry product innovation we are seeing, the role we play for customers, the growth opportunities in front of us, the quality of our execution and the strength of our financial performance. Looking ahead, our teams are ready to execute our plan for the holiday season. As our marketing tagline, Holiday Gifting Made Easy, states, our goal is to make holiday shopping effortless for customers. To win holiday and deliver on this promise, we have created an exciting assortment of great and competitively priced products, and we've mobilized our assets, including our leading-edge digital capabilities, fast and free shipping across the entire site during holiday and, of course, our knowledgeable Blue Shirt and Geek Squad agents who are here to provide compelling in-store experiences and in-home services. 
And so in closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates and their families for everything they will do this holiday to delight our customers. I say to our associates, ""You are Best Buy, and I appreciate you very, very much."" 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry."
255397,405159697,1089120,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectat",989,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by outperformance in the Domestic and International businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the higher gross profit rates in both businesses and lower-than-expected SG&A in the Domestic business. 
I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, Enterprise revenue increased 1.5% to $8.95 billion, primarily due to comparable sales growth in the Domestic business and the continuation of the strong performance we've seen in International throughout this year. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue increased 1.4%, reflecting approximately 10 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.21 or 51% to $0.62. This increase was primarily driven by, one, a higher gross profit rate and the flow-through of higher revenue in the Domestic business; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, Canada, which, as of the end of Q3, has now lapped the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased a greater-than-expected 1.3% to $8.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.8%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 14 large-format and 23 Best Buy Mobile store closures. 
Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don't include categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.1%. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in home theater, mobile phone, wearables and Connected Home was partially offset by declines in gaming. 
In services, the comparable revenue decline of 1.8% moderated, as expected, as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. The decline in services revenue during the quarter was entirely due to the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven primarily by lower frequency of claims on extended warranty. 
Domestic online revenue of $881 million increased 24.1% on a comparable basis, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.8% versus 8.8% last year. 
In our International segment, on a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 4% to $753 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, International revenue increased 3.3%, reflecting approximately 70 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 24.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 60 basis points due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories, which were partially offset by the mobile category. 
Unlike Q2 of this year, we did not see year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate from the investments in services pricing or a periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 190 basis points to 24.3%, driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to a more favorable product mix and lapping the disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity last year related to the brand consolidation. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.88 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $18 million. However, the Enterprise revenue increase resulted in leverage of 10 basis points. 
Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.71 billion or 20.9% of revenue, an increase of $20 million. This increase was primarily driven by the timing of previously outlined investments. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $169 million or 22.4% of revenue, a decline of $2 million, driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 110 basis points of SG&A rate decline were driven by sales leverage. 
In the third quarter, we returned $290 million in cash to our shareholders, $201 million through share repurchases and $89 million in regular dividend. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $931 million. 
I would now like to talk about our fourth quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter, as we execute our holiday plans, which includes a disciplined promotional strategy, we expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.62 to $1.67 compared to $1.53 last year. This outlook assumes a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 315 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 35% to 35.5%. 
Note that our revenue and EPS expectations include approximately $30 million or $0.06 of net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio that we received in the fourth quarter of last year. 
From a revenue standpoint, we are excited by the rate of technology innovations, the quality of our assortment and our ability to execute. As Hubert said earlier, we also need to factor in our projections the impact of recent product recalls that happened in the last few months and that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally expected. The impact of the recalls on Q4 is expected to be approximately $200 million. With this incorporated, our Enterprise revenue expectation is $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. Underlying our Enterprise performance is Domestic comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% and International comparable sales in the range of negative 2% to positive 2%. 
Lastly, I want to take one final opportunity to remind everyone that, as we announced earlier this year, we will no longer be doing a holiday sales release in early January due to the growing importance of that month to our Q4 financial results. We look forward to talking to you in February on our Q4 call. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

These market share gains have slightly moderated as -- because it's hard to continue forever, but we have built a capability that's quite unique. The other thing that we want to highlight, and we've talked about it, I think, on previous calls, this cycle or this time is different from the time where TVs went to digital and it was a much more contained cycle. We see continued product innovation today and coming in the future, and this continued product innovation allows us to appeal to the type of customers that we appeal to, which are in part the leading-edge and early adopters, provide this great experience and allows us to stay ahead of the game.

It was somewhere in between, and that's a little bit of what we're seeing. To your question about how long does the trend last, it's a little tricky. Remember, we talked a bit about single SKU and the ability to buy the phone across multiple carriers. That means we had a better supply of inventory, had more inventory that was available for customers, so that means quicker sell-through early on. And so we're watching it now to look at the trends that implies going out -- we like where the trends are holding up right now. And typically, as we watch the cycle, it obviously tails as you go through the year, but it usually is -- when people want the phone, it's a cycle that continues. So again, we're not going to quite provide guidance into next year, but it tends to be a cycle that continues over time as people replace their phone."

To your question about kind of elaborate on the replacement cycle, Hubert has started on it. The truth is, yes, there is definitely a repair aspect, but the phone still can be repaired. And if you are quite loyal to both the operating system and the size of your phone, which we are seeing people be loyal to, then you might be more willing to go through some of the repair work and wait for whatever else might be coming. So we actually aren't seeing a ton of people move into other devices. It seems like people are pretty loyal to that combination of operating system and size that's offered and was offered by the Note."

So our customers and the experience we provide gravitate towards the higher -- the larger screens and the more fully featured TVs and not just 4Ks. Again, you have this new innovation with HDR and OLED. So that is playing to our strength. So that dynamic is helping us, okay? And in a sense, we're also helping to create dynamics with our merchandising efforts, our online efforts, our in-store efforts, is allowing us to create that excitement about these more fully featured, larger-screen TVs. I think computing remains a very important strength for us. This is another case where the industry is not doing great, frankly, from a top line standpoint. And it's a combination of the assortment, the creation of a premium, more fully featured exclusive assortments on the Windows side and a strong presence with Apple. The great experience in the stores, in partnership with our key vendors, has really made us a great destination, great customer experience, great market share and evolution of the market. So this is a case where, in partnership with our vendors, in everything we can do, we are helping drive the market and the better outcomes. So these are exciting categories. And looking at Q4, from a demand standpoint, there is potential excitement with both existing categories and then, of course, these new emerging categories because, of course, these waves of growth, and there is, indeed, this year, quite a bit of innovation."

Also, collaboration, upstream in product design is something that is a great capability that we have, and we're able to work with some key vendors upstream to together create a winning strategy for our common customers.

That, however, was also offset by a little bit of a decline in the mobile category, where we also have some mix challenges there. The other thing that I would note is, as you compare to the second quarter and you think sequentially about what's happened in profit, we did not see material pressure from the investments in services pricing or the periodic profit-share benefit. And so you kind of took those pressures away and then saw this bit better result around some of that mix and assortment, and it was very, very helpful to our overall margin rate.

In your comments here, I think it's fair to say you sound pretty constructive as we head into this holiday season. The questions I have, and I'll kind of lump them together, I mean, to what extent -- as you look at your promotional -- your plans or maybe what you've seen from competitors, does that seem more subdued or rational than prior years? And then to what extent is this maybe spreading out? Did deemphasizing Black Friday help to give you confidence that we lower the risk of maybe some irrational behavior out there? Then the final question with that, is there a product -- I know we talked a lot about TVs and other categories, but is there a product that you think will really help to drive the holiday season this year?"

So is the promotional environment this year likely to be more subdued? Short answer is no. I think it's always promotional, and our category, as we all know, is used by certain players as a way to attract traffic. So there's some -- from time to time, there will be aggressive promotions on their behalf, oftentimes with limited quantities, but it creates a -- so no, we cannot see any change from that standpoint. Black Friday, I think with -- until the game is played, it's hard to know. But we do see a combination of a bit of spreading out but also peaks and valleys being higher and steeper as the consumer has been trained to shop when it's -- the prices are more promotional. So I don't think that there is a material change here. From a product standpoint, I think what's exciting this year is that there's a broad range of exciting categories across what I would characterize as some of our more traditional product categories like, for example, TVs and computing. The new TVs are just extraordinary. In computing, our teams have done a great job. As well as these emerging categories, so around Connected Home, around wearable, around drones, around virtual reality. There's many reasons to come and check our products. Portable audio, there is also headphones. There's some really cool new headphones. I mean I'm personally so excited about my personal holiday shopping. I have to disclose I'm going to buy a new drone. I bought one last year, but I'm going to buy a new one. This is exciting."

To your question about in-home adviser, I'll give a little color. And if Hubert would like to add any, he's more than welcome. So obviously, we noted that we're at least rolling out to one more market. It's still very early. In a test like this, obviously, it takes time not just from an understanding results perspective but also just from learning for us, expertise, training and ensuring we have seamless handoffs between our stores and the in-home experience. And so we're really working hard to ensure that we understand all those operational components. We like the experiences we're learning about in the home. It reinforces, I think, for us, this idea that there's a lot of technology, it continues to evolve very rapidly, but there is confusion, once people have it in their homes, in terms of not just how to use it. This isn't just about broken, it's also about, ""How do I do the most with it and actually understand how to take it to the next level?"" And then when I'm comfortable doing the most with it, I'm often more likely to investigate and play with more things in my home. So we like the things that we're learning. You can tell we're taking a very measured approach to making sure that if we're going to do this, we do it right, and we have a lot of confidence in the value prop. That being said, at this point, the teams are incredibly focused on delivering holiday and all the intricacies that go with that. And so we'll continue to learn, and then we'll obviously update you as we head into next year."

So that's why Geek Squad on-demand is an opportunity. And if you do the math, given our product market share and our percentage of attach, the bulk of the market is something that, historically, we had not addressed. And we're seeing some exciting green shoots and experiments. We talked a little bit on the call about Canada. We're talking about Magnolia Care. So this is hard work because it's building a new business in a sense or reinventing an existing business. But the -- we continue to be excited by the opportunity and very focused on doing what it takes, bringing the right products, service offerings but also the processes to deliver the capabilities and then to go to market.

And then we are also in the process -- we've begun the process of deploying appliances in the other store. We don't have a forecast at this point in terms of the percentage of the business this will represent, and then, of course, bear in mind that whatever space we allocate to appliance will cannibalize other product categories.
