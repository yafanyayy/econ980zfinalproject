Overall, we're pleased and encouraged by achievements and results in 2015. During the year, we focused on the fundamentals: growing and deepening our customer relationships and also strengthening our financial performance by investing in initiatives that will drive revenue growth and create a more efficient and effective organization in the future. As a result, we're a much stronger organization today and are committed to continuing to build sustainable franchise value. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $272 million, bringing our full year 2015 total to $1 billion.
Earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.21 per diluted share and $0.76 per diluted share for the full year. These results reflect growth in total adjusted revenue despite the challenging operating environment. Importantly, we continue to deliver results in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth, including checking accounts, households, Regions360 relationships and credit card accounts. For example, checking accounts grew by more than 2% during the year, and active credit cards increased 11%. We remain focused on expanding and deepening relationships through our need-based approach to relationship banking, and our 2015 results demonstrate that this approach is working.
During the year, we delivered strong average deposit growth of $3 billion or 4%. The mix of our deposits continues to strengthen as 92% are now low-cost deposits. As we have noted before, our markets provide us with a unique and competitive advantages from a deposit composition perspective.
In 2015, we achieved solid adjust loan growth of $5 billion or 6% from the prior year. Adjusted loans and leases include a lease reclassification adjustments, which David will speak to you shortly. Both business and consumer grew loans with total production for the year of $66 billion or an increase of 12% from 2014. Business lending had an excellent year growing adjusted loans 7%. Commercial banking, corporate banking, all grew loans. And 95% of our markets achieved loan growth, reflecting strength of our business model collaborate with industry and product specialists to grow loans. In particular, within corporate banking, our specialized industries grew experienced solid growth led by technology and defense as well as franchise restaurant, and the real estate investment trust lending business was strong throughout the year. Consumer Lending was also strong in 2015. Total loans exceeded $30 billion at year end, an increase of 5% over 2014. Mortgage led this growth with loans increasing $496 million or 4%. Additionally, our new initiative bolstered growth in indirect lending with increased loans of $339 million. Additionally, credit card balances increased 7% from the previous year, which drove growth in card and ATM income of $30 million or 9%. Total adjusted revenue for the year increased 2% over 2014, reflecting growth in the balance sheet and investments we made to grow and diversify our revenue. Capital markets income was exceptionally strong, increasing $31 million. Our recent acquisition of Block Arch Partners as well as our planned initiatives are expected to further augment capital markets income in the future. Wealth Management had a strong year with income increasing 10% over the prior year. Our focus to grow Wealth Management by continuing to retain, improve and develop talent was evident in the success of our financial consultants and insurance initiatives. During 2015, we executed on our capital plan, returning 93% of earnings to shareholders, which is expected to be the highest percentages among our peers. We also made several small yet important investments and acquisitions in 2015 that will help drive future income. These transactions were prudent and optimal use of our capital enabling us to expand our capabilities and product offerings to supplement future revenue growth.
With respect to the economic environment, while the U.S. economy is still slow and steadily improving, there is a clear significant pressure from the global economy. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industries while benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our energy portfolio. As expected, there continues to be downward migration in risk ratings in this portfolio. These shifts will continue if oil prices remain at current levels. However, we remain in close contact with our energy customers and believe it, we're taking appropriate actions to mitigate We continue to prudently build reserves, which now stand at 6% of our direct energy exposure. As a result, we are cautious but we expect the future losses related to this portfolio to be managed. As we began 2016, we remain committed to our 3 primary strategic initiatives: first, grow and diversify our revenue streams; secondarily, to practice disciplined expense management; and lastly, to affect capital. These are all integral to successful execution of our strategic plans. We continue to operate in a challenging environment, and that requires us to focus on what we can control. To that end, as we discussed in our Investor Day in November last year, it is essential to take more aggressive steps as it relates to expense management. Our goal is to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next 3 years, approximately 9% of the 2015 adjusted expense base. This plan, which is underway, will help us kind of growth initiatives and bring sustainable franchise value. In summary, 2015 was a solid year for Regions. We accomplished a great deal while laying the foundation of future earnings growth.
With that, I'll now turn over to David who will cover the details for the fourth quarter. David?"

I'll take you through the fourth quarter details and then provide our expectations for 2016. As Grayson noted, 2015 was a solid year for Regions, and the year-end was particularly strong sets us well -- sets us up well for 2016. Before I get started, during the fourth quarter Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases, which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The cumulative effects on pretax income, lower net interest income and other financing income, $15 million and reduced the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the quarter. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earnings assets totaling approximately $834  million at the end of the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net interest income or other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period.
With respect to balance sheet, adjusted loan and lease balances totaled $82 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and were up $1 billion or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending achieved solid growth with adjusted balances totaling $52 billion at quarter end, an increase of 1%. Adjusted commercial loans grew $563 million or 1%. Commitments increased 2%, and utilization increased 30 basis points to 46.3%.
Consumer Lending had another strong quarter with every loan category increasing. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Indirect auto lending increased 2% and other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $55 million linked quarter or 11%. We are pleased with the results of this initiative. Year-to-date, loans in this portfolio have increased $339 million, and we expect continued growth in 2016.
Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 6% from the previous quarter, and our penetration rate into our deposit base now stands at 17.3%. up 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.
Mortgage loan balances increased $81 million, and total home equity balances increased $31 million from the previous quarter as new production continued to outpace portfolio runoffs.
Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $322 million, and ending balances increased over $1.2 billion during this quarter. Deposit costs remain at historically low levels at 11 basis points, and total funding costs remained low at 26 basis points. With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit-funded with 74% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits were 92% of total deposits. Approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people, and 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we believe our deposit base will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.
Let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $856 million, essentially flat with last quarter. However, excluding the impact of the lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income increased $15 million or 2%. Higher loan balances and balance sheet hedging and optimization strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter increase along with interest recoveries. The benefit from interest recoveries is not expected to be at this level in the first quarter, approximately $4 million less going forward. The overall increase in net interest income and other financing income was partially offset by fixed asset repricing.
The net interest margin was 3.08%. Now we're excluding the lease adjustment, net interest margin was 3.13% or flat with the previous quarter.
Total noninterest income increased 4% on an adjusted basis from the third quarter, driven primarily by gains on sale of affordable housing investments and by higher card and ATM income. Card and ATM fees increased 3%, primarily related to an increase in commercial bank card usage and increase in the number of active cards of 3.7% and an increase in seasonal consumer spending. Service charges were impacted by posting changes that went into effect in early November and reduced noninterest income by approximately $7 million. We expect the ongoing impact of this change to be at the lower end of our previously stated $10 million to $15 million quarterly range. Wealth Management income was down slightly quarter-over-quarter due to lower insurance income, partially offset by higher investment management and trust fee income.
Capital markets income was relatively flat linked quarter as revenue from new product and service offerings was offset primarily by lower loan syndication fees. 
Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the fourth quarter were $873 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $861 million, representing a decline of $33 million or 4% from the prior quarter. This included a decrease of $24 million in FDIC fees, primarily due to additional expenses of $23 million in the third quarter related to prior assessments. The expected quarterly run rate for this expense in the $22 million to $24 million range excluding the impact of the proposed FDIC surcharge. Additionally, the fourth quarter benefited from lower expenses related to unfunded commitment cost of $12 million. Salaries and benefits increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million in the severance-related expenses. We also incurred $6 million of expenses related to 29 branch consolidations. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.4% in the fourth quarter, but excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.7%.
As discussed at Investor Day, we will continue to make investments to grow our business. However, we must be more efficient in everything we do. As Grayson noted, our plan to become a more efficient organization, including the elimination of $300 million in business is underway.
Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $18 million to $78 million and represented 38 basis points of average loans. This increase was primarily related to 1 large charge-off in the Energy loan portfolio. Total Business Services criticized and classified loans increased $117 million, driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans, primarily within the Energy portfolio. However, total nonaccrual loans excluding loans held for sale declined from the third quarter. Total debt restructured loans or TDRs also declined, down 1% from the prior quarter. The provision for loan losses was $69 million, and our allowance for loan losses was down 2 basis points to 1.36% at the end of the fourth quarter. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans or coverage ratio was 141%. Regarding our Energy portfolio although prices have declined, exposure remains manageable. Should oil prices remain at current levels, charge-offs will be in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016. The Energy charge-off taken this quarter reduces the previous range of $50 million to $100 million. Additionally, we have currently have just over $150 million reserved or 6% of our direct energy exposure. And given where we are in the credit cycle, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity.
During 2015, we returned $925 million to shareholders, which included the repurchase of $621 million of common stock and $304 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated in 11.7%, and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums.
Our loan and deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83%. And at the end of the quarter, we were fully compliant as it relates to the liquidity coverage ratio.
Now let me give you an overview of our current expectations for 2016. We expect total loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range and an average basis excluding the impact of the operating lease reclassification. And regarding deposits, we expect full year average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range. And commensurate with our loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase in the 2% to 4% range. Now should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. As a result of our investments, we expect to grow adjusted noninterest income somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. Now we will continue to make investments in 2016, however, we have also begun to execute our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses, of which 35% to 45% will occur in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from 2015.
We expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 63% in 2016 and positive operating leverage somewhere in the 2% to 4% range. Now we still expect our net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the current price of oil, we would expect to be at a top end of that range. In closing, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year. The investments we made in 2015 positions us well for 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. I will now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

The first part was an energy credit that sit around for the few years M&A activity, which originally led to the credit. It is a Shared National Credit. There are 5 banks involved, and we saw some distress in this credit in the early part of the year, so we have been working this credit really hard during the course of the year. And it simply came to conclusion near the end of the year. And what we've done is we have appropriately marked that credit. We've taken the loss in that credit, as you've heard, and we've moved the residual balance into the held for sale, and we anticipate that we will have that our held for sale numbers by the end of -- we're hoping January, but certainly this quarter, it will be out of our numbers. And back to individual credits, the charge-off on that approximately $25 million, just for rounding. In terms of how we think about our reserve and look at prices as we work our way through our process, in the backs of our minds, if we look at our price deck, our price deck is roughly $36 right now sensitivity, $28.90, so we're looking in that range as we determine and establish what those numbers should be, but we're also looking very heavily at each and every individual customer, what their cash flow looks like what our collateral looks like, what our asset coverage is, we currently have asset coverage of 1.71x and business, for example. So again in conversations that we have ongoing conversations with our customers because we really do have a small number of customers, we still believe that repayments ability is adequate with them and again, establish our reserves accordingly."

So from our standpoint, we have one of the strongest levels of common equity Tier 1 of our peer group. We did return 93% of our earnings to our shareholders, which we think was appropriate and as a result, we didn't want to continue to accrete capital because we felt like we had enough capital to run our business in the prudent manner. So we look at our stresses all the time not just from a CCAR standpoint, we do that for ourselves to make sure we were managing and optimizing our capital in our company, so that we have enough in time to stress and -- but not too much in terms of ensuring we can have an appropriate return to our shareholders.

Overall, we're pleased and encouraged by our achievements and results in 2015. During the year, we focused on the fundamentals: growing and deepening our customer relationships while also strengthening our financial performance by investing in initiatives that will drive revenue growth and create a more efficient and effective organization in the future. As a result, we're a much stronger organization today and are committed to continuing to build sustainable franchise value. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $272 million, bringing our full year 2015 total to $1 billion. Earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.21 per diluted share and $0.76 per diluted share for the full year. These results reflect growth in total adjusted revenue despite a challenging operating environment. 
Importantly, we continue to deliver results in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth, including checking accounts, households, Regions360 relationships and credit card accounts. For example, checking accounts grew by more than 2% during the year, and active credit cards increased 11%. We remained focused on expanding and deepening relationships through our need-based approach to relationship banking, and our 2015 results demonstrate that this approach is working.
During the year, we delivered strong average deposit growth of $3 billion or 4%. The mix of our deposits continues to strengthen as 92% are now low-cost deposits. As we have noted before, our markets provide us with the unique and competitive advantages from a deposit composition perspective.
In 2015, we achieved solid adjusted loan growth of $5 billion or 6% from the prior year. Adjusted loans and leases include a lease reclassification adjustment, which David will speak to you shortly. Both business and consumer grew loans with total production for the year of $66 billion or an increase of 12% from 2014. Business lending had an excellent year growing adjusted loans to 7%. Commercial banking, corporate banking and real estate banking all grew loans. And 95% of our markets achieved loan growth, reflecting strength of our business model as local bankers collaborate with industry and product specialists to grow loans. In particular, within Corporate Banking, our specialized industries grew to experience solid growth led by technology and defense as well as franchise restaurant. And the real estate investment trust lending business was strong throughout the year. Consumer lending was also strong in 2015. Total loans exceeded $30 billion at year-end, an increase of 5% over 2014. Mortgage led this growth with loans increasing $496 million or 4%. Additionally, our new point-of-sale initiative bolstered growth in indirect lending with increased loans of $339 million. Additionally, credit card balances increased 7% from the previous year, which drove growth in card and ATM income of $30 million or 9%. 
Total adjusted revenue for the year increased 2% over 2014, reflecting growth in the balance sheet and investments we've made to grow and diversify our revenue. Capital markets income was exceptionally strong, increasing $31 million. Our recent acquisition of BlackArch Partners as well as our planned initiatives are expected to further augment capital markets income in the future. 
Wealth Management had a strong year with income increasing 10% over the prior year. Our focus to grow Wealth Management by continuing to retain, recruit and develop talent was evident in the success of our financial consultants and insurance initiatives. 
During 2015, we executed on our capital plan, returning 93% of earnings to shareholders, which is expected to be one of the highest percentages among our peers. We also made several small yet important investments and acquisitions in 2015 that will help drive future income. These transactions were a prudent and optimal use for our capital, enabling us to expand our capabilities and product offerings to supplement future revenue growth.
With respect to the economic environment, while the U.S. economy is still slow and steadily improving, there is a clear significant pressure from the global economy. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industries while benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our energy portfolio. As expected, there continues to be downward migration in risk ratings in this portfolio. These shifts will continue if oil prices remain at current levels. However, we've remained in close contact with our energy customers. And believe it, we are taking appropriate actions to mitigate vulnerabilities. We continue to prudently build reserves, which now stand at 6% of our direct energy exposure.  As a result, we are cautious, but we expect the future losses related to this portfolio to be managed. 
As we began 2016, we remain committed to our 3 primary strategic initiatives: first, grow and diversify our revenue streams; secondarily, to practice disciplined expense management; and lastly, to effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan. We continue to operate in a challenging environment that requires us to focus on what we can control. 
To that end, as we discussed in our Investor Day in November of last year, it's essential that we take more aggressive steps as it relates to expense management. Our goal is to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next 3 years, approximately 9% of the 2015 adjusted expense base. This plan, which is underway, will help us fund our growth initiatives and build sustainable franchise value. 
In summary, 2015 was a solid year for Regions. We accomplished a great deal while laying the foundation for future earnings growth.
With that, I'll now turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the fourth quarter. David?"

I'll take you through the fourth quarter details and then provide our expectations for 2016. As Grayson noted, 2015 was a solid year for Regions, and the year ended particularly strong, which sets up well -- sets us up well for 2016. 
Before I get started, during the fourth quarter Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases, which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The cumulative effect on pretax income, lower net interest income and other financing income, $15 million, and reduced the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the quarter. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earning assets totaling approximately $834 million at the end of the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net interest income or other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period.
With respect to the balance sheet, adjusted loan and lease balances totaled $82 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and were up $1 billion or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending achieved solid growth with adjusted balances totaling $52 billion at quarter end, an increase of 1%. Adjusted commercial loans grew $563 million or 1%. Commitments increased 2%, and line utilization increased 30 basis points to 46.3%.
Consumer lending had another strong quarter with every loan category increasing. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Indirect auto lending increased 2%; and other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $55 million linked quarter or 11%. We are pleased with the results of this new initiative. Year-to-date, loans in this portfolio have increased $339 million, and we expect continued growth in 2016.
Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 6% from the previous quarter, and our penetration rate into our deposit base now stands at 17.3%, up 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.
Mortgage loan balances increased $81 million, and total home equity balances increased $31 million from the previous quarter as new production continue to outpace portfolio runoff.
Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $322 million, and ending balances increased over $1.2 billion during this quarter. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points, and total funding costs remained low at 26 basis points. With the respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit-funded with 74% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits were 92% of total deposits. Approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people, and 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we believe our deposit bases will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.
Let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $856 million, essentially flat with last quarter. However, excluding the impact of the lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income increased $15 million or 2%. Higher loan balances and balance sheet hedging and optimization strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter increase along with interest recoveries. The benefit from interest recoveries is not expected to be at this level in the first quarter, approximately $4 million less going forward. The overall increase in net interest income and other financing income was partially offset by fixed asset repricing. The net interest margin was 3.08%. However, excluding the lease adjustment, net interest margin was 3.13% or flat with the previous quarter.
Total noninterest income increased 4% on an adjusted basis from the third quarter, driven primarily by gains on sale of affordable housing investments and by higher card and ATM income. Card and ATM fees increased 3%, primarily related to an increase in commercial bank card usage and increase in the number of active cards of 3.7% and an increase in seasonal consumer spending. Service charges were impacted by posting order changes that went into effect in early November and reduced noninterest income by approximately $7 million. We expect the ongoing impact of this change to be at the lower end of our previously stated $10 million to $15 million quarterly range. 
Wealth Management income was down slightly quarter-over-quarter due to lower insurance income, partially offset by higher investment management and trust fee income.
Capital markets income was relatively flat linked quarter as revenue from new product and service offerings was offset primarily by lower loan syndication fees. 
Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the fourth quarter were $873 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $861 million, representing a decline of $33 million or 4% from the prior quarter. This included a decrease of $24 million in FDIC fees, primarily due to additional expenses of $23 million in the third quarter related to prior assessments. The expected quarterly run rate for this expense is in the $22 million to $24 million range, excluding the impact of the proposed FDIC surcharge. Additionally, the fourth quarter benefited from lower expenses related to unfunded commitment cost of $12 million. Salaries and benefits increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million in severance-related expenses. We also incurred $6 million of expenses related to 29 branch consolidations. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.4% in the fourth quarter. But excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.7%.
As discussed at Investor Day, we will continue to make investments to grow our business. However, we must be more efficient in everything we do. As Grayson noted, our plan to become a more efficient organization, including the elimination of $300 million in core expenses, is underway.
Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $18 million to $78 million and represented 38 basis points of average loans. This increase was primarily related to one large charge-off in the energy loan portfolio. Total business services criticized and classified loans increased to $117 million, driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans, primarily within the energy portfolio. However, total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined from the third quarter. Troubled debt restructured loans, or TDRs, also declined, down 1% from the prior quarter. The provision for loan losses was $69 million, and our allowance for loan losses was down 2 basis points to 1.36% at the end of the fourth quarter. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans or coverage ratio was 141%. 
Now regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices have declined, exposure remains manageable. Should oil prices remain at current levels, charge-offs will be in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016. The energy charge-off taken this quarter reduces the previous range of $50 million to $100 million. Additionally, we have currently have just over $150 million reserved or 6% of our direct energy exposure. And given where we are in the credit cycle, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During 2015, we returned $925 million to shareholders, which included the repurchase of $621 million of common stock and $304 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.7%, and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. Our loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83%. And at the end of the quarter, we were fully compliant as it relates to the liquidity coverage ratio.
Now let me give you an overview of our current expectations for 2016. We expect total loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis, excluding the impact of the operating lease reclassification. And regarding deposits, we expect full year average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range. And commensurate with our loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase in the 2% to 4% range. Now should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. As a result of our investments, we expect to grow adjusted noninterest income somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. And we will continue to make investments in 2016, however, we have also begun to execute our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses, of which 35% to 45% will occur in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from 2015.
We expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 63% in 2016 and positive operating leverage somewhere in the 2% to 4% range. Now we still expect our net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the current price of oil, we would expect to be at the top end of that range. 
In closing, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year. The investments we've made in 2015 positions us well for 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning.  I will now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

Let me go ahead and answer that first part of the question, and I'll address the second part. The first part was an energy credit that sit around for a few years with M&A activity, which originally led to the credit. It is the Shared National Credit. There are 5 banks involved. And we saw some distress in this credit in the early part of the year, so we have been working this credit really hard during the course of the year. And it simply came to conclusion near the end of the year. And what we've done is we have appropriately marked that credit. We've taken the loss on that credit, as you've heard, and we've moved the residual balance into our held for sale, and we anticipate that we will have that out of our held-for-sale numbers by the end of -- we're hoping January but, certainly this quarter, it will be out of our numbers. And back to individual credit, the charge-off on that was approximately $25 million, just for rounding. In terms of how we think about our reserve and look at prices as we work our way through our process, in the backs of our minds, if we look at our price deck, our price deck is roughly $36 right now; sensitivity, $28.90. So we're looking in that range as we determine and establish what those numbers should be, but we're also looking very heavily at each and every individual customer, what their cash flow looks like, what our collateral looks like, what our asset coverage is.

There'll be another roughly $6 million associated with those branches, so it's got $12 million, and we expect to pay -- excuse me, a payback on that of about 2 years, which is what we've had historically.

So from our standpoint, we have one of the strongest levels of common equity Tier 1 of our peer group. We did return 93% of our earnings to our shareholders, which we think was appropriate. And as a result, we didn't want to continue to accrete capital because we felt like we had enough capital to run our business in a prudent manner.

Overall, we're pleased and encouraged by our achievements and results in 2015. During the year, we focused on the fundamentals: growing and deepening our customer relationships while also strengthening our financial performance by investing in initiatives that will drive revenue growth and create a more efficient and effective organization in the future. As a result, we're a much stronger organization today and are committed to continuing to build sustainable franchise value. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $272 million, bringing our full year 2015 total to $1 billion. Earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.21 per diluted share and $0.76 per diluted share for the full year. These results reflect growth in total adjusted revenue despite a challenging operating environment. 
Importantly, we continue to deliver results in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth, including checking accounts, households, Regions360 relationships and credit card accounts. For example, checking accounts grew by more than 2% during the year, and active credit cards increased 11%. We remain focused on expanding and deepening relationships through our need-based approach to relationship banking, and our 2015 results demonstrate that this approach is working.
During the year, we delivered strong average deposit growth of $3 billion or 4%. The mix of our deposits continues to strengthen as 92% are now low-cost deposits. As we have noted before, our markets provide us with unique and competitive advantages from a deposit composition perspective.
In 2015, we achieved solid adjusted loan growth of $5 billion or 6% from the prior year. Adjusted loans and leases include lease reclassification adjustments, which David will speak to shortly. Both business and consumer grew loans with total production for the year of $66 billion or an increase of 12% from 2014. Business lending had an excellent year growing adjusted loans 7%. Commercial banking, corporate banking and real estate banking all grew loans. And 95% of our markets achieved loan growth, reflecting strength of our business model as local bankers collaborate with industry and product specialists to grow loans. In particular, within Corporate Banking, our specialized industries group experienced solid growth led by technology and defense as well as franchise restaurant. And the real estate investment trust lending business was strong throughout the year. 
Consumer lending was also strong in 2015. Total loans exceeded $30 billion at year-end, an increase of 5% over 2014. Mortgage led this growth with loans increasing $496 million or 4%. Additionally, our new point-of-sale initiative bolstered growth in indirect lending with increased loans of $339 million. Additionally, credit card balances increased 7% from the previous year, which drove growth in card and ATM income of $30 million or 9%. 
Total adjusted revenue for the year increased 2% over 2014, reflecting growth in the balance sheet and investments we made to grow and diversify our revenue. Capital markets income was exceptionally strong, increasing $31 million. Our recent acquisition of BlackArch Partners as well as our planned initiatives are expected to further augment capital markets income in the future. 
Wealth Management had a strong year with income increasing 10% over the prior year. Our focus to grow Wealth Management by continuing to retain, recruit and develop talent was evident in the success of our financial consultants and insurance initiatives. 
During 2015, we executed on our capital plan, returning 93% of earnings to shareholders, which is expected to be one of the highest percentages among our peers. We also made several small yet important investments and acquisitions in 2015 that will help drive future income. These transactions were a prudent and optimal use for our capital, enabling us to expand our capabilities and product offerings to supplement future revenue growth.
With respect to the economic environment, while the U.S. economy is still slow and steadily improving, there is a clear significant pressure from the global economy. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industries while benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our energy portfolio. As expected, there continues to be downward migration in risk ratings in this portfolio. These shifts will continue if oil prices remain at current levels. However, we've remained in close contact with our energy customers. And believe it, we're taking appropriate actions to mitigate vulnerabilities. We continue to prudently build reserves, which now stand at 6% of our direct energy exposure. As a result, we are cautious, but we expect the future losses related to this portfolio to be managed. 
As we began 2016, we remain committed to our 3 primary strategic initiatives: first, grow and diversify our revenue streams; secondarily, to practice disciplined expense management; and lastly, to effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan. We continue to operate in a challenging environment that requires us to focus on what we can control. 
To that end, as we discussed in our Investor Day in November of last year, it's essential that we take more aggressive steps as it relates to expense management. Our goal is to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next 3 years, approximately 9% of the 2015 adjusted expense base. This plan, which is underway, will help us fund our growth initiatives and build sustainable franchise value. 
In summary, 2015 was a solid year for Regions. We accomplished a great deal while laying the foundation for futures earning growth.
With that, I'll now turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the fourth quarter. David?"

As Grayson noted, 2015 was a solid year for Regions, and the year ended particularly strong, which sets up well -- sets us up well for 2016. 
Before I get started, during the fourth quarter, Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The cumulative effect on pretax income lowered net interest income and other financing income $15 million and reduced the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the quarter. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earning assets totaling approximately $834 million at the end of the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net interest income or other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period.
With respect to the balance sheet, adjusted loan and lease balances totaled $82 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and were up $1 billion or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending achieved solid growth with adjusted balances totaling $52 billion at quarter-end, an increase of 1%. Adjusted commercial loans grew $563 million or 1%. Commitments increased 2%, and line utilization increased 30 basis points to 46.3%.
Consumer lending had another strong quarter with every loan category increasing. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Indirect auto lending increased 2%; and other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $55 million link quarter or 11%. We are pleased with the results of this new initiative. Year-to-date, loans in this portfolio have increased $339 million, and we expect continued growth in 2016.
Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 6% from the previous quarter, and our penetration rate into our deposit base now stands at 17.3%, up 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.
Mortgage loan balances increased $81 million, and total home equity balances increased $31 million from the previous quarter as new production continued to outpace portfolio runoff.
Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $322 million, and ending balances increased over $1.2 billion during this quarter. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points, and total funding costs remained low at 26 basis points. With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit funded with 74% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits were 92% of total deposits. Approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people, and 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we believe our deposit basis will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.
Let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $856 million, essentially flat with last quarter. However, excluding the impact of the lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income increased $15 million or 2%. Higher loan balances and balance sheet hedging and optimization strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter increase along with interest recoveries. 
The benefit from interest recoveries is not expected to be at this level in the first quarter, approximately $4 million less going forward. The overall increase in net interest income and other financing income was partially offset by fixed asset repricing. The net interest margin was 3.08%. However, excluding the lease adjustment, net interest margin was 3.13% or flat with the previous quarter.
Total noninterest income increased 4% on an adjusted basis from the third quarter, driven primarily by gains on sale of affordable housing investments and by higher card and ATM income. Card and ATM fees increased 3%, primarily related to an increase in commercial bank card usage, an increase in the number of active cards of 3.7% and an increase in seasonal consumer spending. Service charges were impacted by posting order changes that went into effect in early November and reduced noninterest income by approximately $7 million. We expect the ongoing impact of this change to be at the lower end of our previously stated $10 million to $15 million quarterly range. 
Wealth Management income was down slightly quarter-over-quarter due to lower insurance income, partially offset by higher investment management and trust fee income.
Capital markets income was relatively flat linked quarter as revenue from new product and service offerings was offset primarily by lower loan syndication fees. 
Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the fourth quarter were $873 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $861 million, representing a decline of $33 million or 4% from the prior quarter. This included a decrease of $24 million in FDIC fees primarily due to additional expenses of $23 million in the third quarter related to prior assessments. The expected quarterly run rate for this expense is in the $22 million to $24 million range, excluding the impact of the proposed FDIC surcharge. Additionally, the fourth quarter benefited from lower expenses related to unfunded commitment cost of $12 million. Salaries and benefits increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million in severance-related expenses. We also incurred $6 million of expenses related to 29 branch consolidations. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.4% in the fourth quarter. But excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.7%.
As discussed at Investor Day, we will continue to make investments to grow our business. However, we must be more efficient in everything we do. As Grayson noted, our plan to become a more efficient organization, including the elimination of $300 million in core expenses, is underway.
Let us move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $18 million to $78 million and represented 38 basis points of average loans. This increase was primarily related to one large charge-off in the energy loan portfolio. Total business services criticized and classified loans increased $117 million, driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans primarily within the energy portfolio. However, total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined from the third quarter. Troubled debt restructured loans, or TDRs, also declined, down 1% from the prior quarter. The provision for loan losses was $69 million, and our allowance for loan losses was down 2 basis points to 1.36% at the end of the fourth quarter. And at quarter-end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans or coverage ratio was 141%. 
Now regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices have declined, exposure remains manageable. Should oil prices remain at current levels, charge-offs will be in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016. The energy charge-off taken this quarter reduces the previous range of $50 million to $100 million. Additionally, we have currently -- have just over $150 million reserved or 6% of our direct energy exposure. And given where we are in the credit cycle, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During 2015, we returned $925 million to shareholders, which included the repurchase of $621 million of common stock and $304 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.7%, and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. Our loan to deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83%. And at the end of the quarter, we were fully compliant as it relates to the liquidity coverage ratios.
Now let me give you an overview of our current expectations for 2016. We expect total loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis, excluding the impact of the operating lease reclassification. And regarding deposits, we expect full year average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range. And commensurate with our loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase in the 2% to 4% range. Now should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. As a result of our investments, we expect to grow adjusted noninterest income somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. And we will continue to make investments in 2016, however, we have also begun to execute our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses, of which 35% to 45% will occur in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from 2015.
We expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 63% in 2016 and positive operating leverage somewhere in the 2% to 4% range. Now we still expect our net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the current price of oil, we would expect to be at the top end of that range. 
In closing, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year. The investments we made in 2015 positions us well for 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. I will now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

Let me go ahead and answer that first part of the question, and I'll address the second part. The first part was an energy credit that's been around for a few years with M&A activity, which originally led to the credit. It is a Shared National Credit. There are 5 banks involved. And we saw some distress in this credit in the early part of the year, so we have been working this credit really hard during the course of the year. And it simply came to conclusion near the end of the year. And what we've done is we have appropriately marked that credit. We've taken the loss on that credit, as you've heard, and we've moved the residual balance into our held for sale, and we anticipate that we will have that out of our held-for-sale numbers by the end of -- we're hoping January, but certainly this quarter, it will be out of our numbers. And back to individual credit, the charge-off on that was approximately $25 million, just for rounding. In terms of how we think about our reserve and look at prices as we work our way through our process, in the backs of our minds, if we look at our price deck, our price deck is roughly $36 right now; sensitivity, $28.90. So we're looking in that range as we determine and establish what those numbers should be, but we're also looking very heavily at each and every individual customer, what their cash flow looks like, what our collateral looks like, what our asset coverage is. We currently have asset coverage of 1.71x in the E&P book as an example. So again, in conversations, and we have them ongoing, conversations with our customers because we really do have a small number of customers, we still believe that repayment ability is adequate with them and again establish our reserves accordingly."

We think about $4 million that won't repeat going forward, but we're looking for a relatively stable NIM, and this is adjusting, by the way, for the lease accounting. So we were at 3.08% on net interest margin, 5 points related to lease adjustments. So 3.13% would have made us flat, and we're looking for a relatively stable -- and just to remind everybody, that's been 1 or 2 points either side of where we are for 2016. And so we're looking for that guidance in terms of growth in NII that we've really been focusing on to be that 2% to 4% through the year.

So again, that would account for the reason that we have roughly 48% of our E&P book that is showing right now as criticized.

So we start breaking it down, we get pretty granular. There's puts and takes either way. If you just want to focus on that component of the December increase, we're probably benefiting in the $5 million to $10 million range in the first quarter. But remember, there's some other things going the other way. You got day counts, about $5 million working against you. You got the interest reversal of $4 million that I talked about in my prepared comments. So I think it's better to kind of look overall at the guidance in terms of relatively stable margin and growth in NII in that 2% to 4% range commensurate with the loan growth that we talked about, the 3% to 5%."

So we look at our stresses all the time, not just from a CCAR standpoint. We do that for ourselves to make sure we're managing and optimizing our capital in our company, so that we have enough in times of stress and -- but not too much in terms of ensuring we can have an appropriate return to our shareholders. So exactly how all this will manifest itself in CCAR, we'll have to see and let the -- we run a lot of programs. We'll just need to see what the results are. We don't see anything drastically different than what we have submitted before, x energy."

Overall, we're pleased and encouraged by our achievements and results in 2015. During the year, we focused on the fundamentals: growing and deepening our customer relationships while also strengthening our financial performance by investing in initiatives that will drive revenue growth and create a more efficient and effective organization in the future. As a result, we're a much stronger organization today and are committed to continuing to build sustainable franchise value. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $272 million, bringing our full year 2015 total to $1 billion. Earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.21 per diluted share and $0.76 per diluted share for the full year. These results reflect growth in total adjusted revenue despite a challenging operating environment. 
Importantly, we continue to deliver results in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth, including checking accounts, households, Regions360 relationships and credit card accounts. For example, checking accounts grew by more than 2% during the year, and active credit cards increased 11%. We remain focused on expanding and deepening relationships through our need-based approach to relationship banking, and our 2015 results demonstrate that this approach is working.
During the year, we delivered strong average deposit growth of $3 billion or 4%. The mix of our deposits continues to strengthen as 92% are now low-cost deposits. As we have noted before, our markets provide us with unique and competitive advantages from a deposit composition perspective.
In 2015, we achieved solid adjusted loan growth of $5 billion or 6% from the prior year. Adjusted loans and leases include lease reclassification adjustments, which David will speak to shortly. Both business and consumer grew loans with total production for the year of $66 billion or an increase of 12% from 2014. Business lending had an excellent year growing adjusted loans 7%. Commercial banking, corporate banking and real estate banking all grew loans. And 95% of our markets achieved loan growth, reflecting strength of our business model as local bankers collaborate with industry and product specialists to grow loans. In particular, within Corporate Banking, our specialized industries group experienced solid growth led by technology and defense as well as franchise restaurant. And the real estate investment trust lending business was strong throughout the year. 
Consumer lending was also strong in 2015. Total loans exceeded $30 billion at year-end, an increase of 5% over 2014. Mortgage led this growth with loans increasing $496 million or 4%. Additionally, our new point-of-sale initiative bolstered growth in indirect lending with increased loans of $339 million. Additionally, credit card balances increased 7% from the previous year, which drove growth in card and ATM income of $30 million or 9%. 
Total adjusted revenue for the year increased 2% over 2014, reflecting growth in the balance sheet and investments we made to grow and diversify our revenue. Capital markets income was exceptionally strong, increasing $31 million. Our recent acquisition of BlackArch Partners as well as our planned initiatives are expected to further augment capital markets income in the future. 
Wealth Management had a strong year with income increasing 10% over the prior year. Our focus to grow Wealth Management by continuing to retain, recruit and develop talent was evident in the success of our financial consultants and insurance initiatives. 
During 2015, we executed on our capital plan, returning 93% of earnings to shareholders, which is expected to be one of the highest percentages among our peers. We also made several small yet important investments and acquisitions in 2015 that will help drive future income. These transactions were a prudent and optimal use of our capital, enabling us to expand our capabilities and product offerings to supplement future revenue growth.
With respect to the economic environment, while the U.S. economy is still slow and steadily improving, there is a clear significant pressure from the global economy. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industries while benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our energy portfolio. As expected, there continues to be downward migration in risk ratings in this portfolio. These shifts will continue if oil prices remain at current levels. However, we remain in close contact with our energy customers and believe that we're taking appropriate actions to mitigate vulnerabilities. We continue to prudently build reserves, which now stand at 6% of our direct energy exposure. As a result, we are cautious, but we expect the future losses related to this portfolio to be managed. 
As we began 2016, we remain committed to our 3 primary strategic initiatives: first, grow and diversify our revenue streams; secondarily, to practice disciplined expense management; and lastly, to effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan. We continue to operate in a challenging environment that requires us to focus on what we can control. 
To that end, as we discussed in our Investor Day in November of last year, it's essential that we take more aggressive steps as it relates to expense management. Our goal is to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next 3 years, approximately 9% of the 2015 adjusted expense base. This plan, which is underway, will help us fund our growth initiatives and build sustainable franchise value. 
In summary, 2015 was a solid year for Regions. We accomplished a great deal while laying the foundation for future earnings growth.
With that, I'll now turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the fourth quarter. David?"

I'll take you through the fourth quarter details and then provide our expectations for 2016. As Grayson noted, 2015 was a solid year for Regions, and the year ended particularly strong, which sets up well -- sets us up well for 2016. 
Before I get started, during the fourth quarter, Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The cumulative effect on pretax income lowered net interest income and other financing income $15 million and reduced the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the quarter. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earning assets totaling approximately $834 million at the end of the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net interest income or other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period.
With respect to the balance sheet, adjusted loan and lease balances totaled $82 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and were up $1 billion or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending achieved solid growth with adjusted balances totaling $52 billion at quarter-end, an increase of 1%. Adjusted commercial loans grew $563 million or 1%. Commitments increased 2%, and line utilization increased 30 basis points to 46.3%.
Consumer lending had another strong quarter with every loan category increasing. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Indirect auto lending increased 2%; and other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $55 million link quarter or 11%. We are pleased with the results of this new initiative. Year-to-date, loans in this portfolio have increased $339 million, and we expect continued growth in 2016.
Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 6% from the previous quarter, and our penetration rate into our deposit base now stands at 17.3%, up 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.
Mortgage loan balances increased $81 million, and total home equity balances increased $31 million from the previous quarter as new production continued to outpace portfolio runoff.
Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $322 million, and ending balances increased over $1.2 billion during this quarter. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points, and total funding costs remained low at 26 basis points. With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit funded with 74% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits were 92% of total deposits. Approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people, and 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.
Let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $856 million, essentially flat with last quarter. However, excluding the impact of the lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income increased $15 million or 2%. Higher loan balances and balance sheet hedging and optimization strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter increase along with interest recoveries. 
The benefit from interest recoveries is not expected to be at this level in the first quarter, approximately $4 million less going forward. The overall increase in net interest income and other financing income was partially offset by fixed asset repricing. The net interest margin was 3.08%. However, excluding the lease adjustment, net interest margin was 3.13% or flat with the previous quarter.
Total noninterest income increased 4% on an adjusted basis from the third quarter, driven primarily by gains on sale of affordable housing investments and by higher card and ATM income. Card and ATM fees increased 3%, primarily related to an increase in commercial bank card usage, an increase in the number of active cards of 3.7% and an increase in seasonal consumer spending. Service charges were impacted by posting order changes that went into effect in early November and reduced noninterest income by approximately $7 million. We expect the ongoing impact of this change to be at the lower end of our previously stated $10 million to $15 million quarterly range. 
Wealth Management income was down slightly quarter-over-quarter due to lower insurance income, partially offset by higher investment management and trust fee income.
Capital markets income was relatively flat linked quarter as revenue from new product and service offerings was offset primarily by lower loan syndication fees. 
Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the fourth quarter were $873 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $861 million, representing a decline of $33 million or 4% from the prior quarter. This included a decrease of $24 million in FDIC fees primarily due to additional expenses of $23 million in the third quarter related to prior assessments. The expected quarterly run rate for this expense is in the $22 million to $24 million range, excluding the impact of the proposed FDIC surcharge. Additionally, the fourth quarter benefited from lower expenses related to unfunded commitment cost of $12 million. Salaries and benefits increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million in severance-related expenses. We also incurred $6 million of expenses related to 29 branch consolidations. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.4% in the fourth quarter. But excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.7%.
As discussed at Investor Day, we will continue to make investments to grow our business. However, we must be more efficient in everything we do. As Grayson noted, our plan to become a more efficient organization, including the elimination of $300 million in core expenses, is underway.
Let us move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $18 million to $78 million and represented 38 basis points of average loans. This increase was primarily related to one large charge-off in the energy loan portfolio. Total business services criticized and classified loans increased $117 million, driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans primarily within the energy portfolio. However, total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined from the third quarter. Troubled debt restructured loans, or TDRs, also declined, down 1% from the prior quarter. The provision for loan losses was $69 million, and our allowance for loan losses was down 2 basis points to 1.36% at the end of the fourth quarter. And at quarter-end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans or coverage ratio was 141%. 
Now regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices have declined, exposure remains manageable. Should oil prices remain at current levels, charge-offs will be in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016. The energy charge-off taken this quarter reduces the previous range of $50 million to $100 million. Additionally, we have currently -- have just over $150 million reserved or 6% of our direct energy exposure. And given where we are in the credit cycle, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During 2015, we returned $925 million to shareholders, which included the repurchase of $621 million of common stock and $304 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.7%, and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. Our loan to deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83%. And at the end of the quarter, we were fully compliant as it relates to the liquidity coverage ratios.
Now let me give you an overview of our current expectations for 2016. We expect total loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis, excluding the impact of the operating lease reclassification. And regarding deposits, we expect full year average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range. And commensurate with our loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase in the 2% to 4% range. Now should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. As a result of our investments, we expect to grow adjusted noninterest income somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. And we will continue to make investments in 2016, however, we have also begun to execute our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses, of which 35% to 45% will occur in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from 2015.
We expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 63% in 2016 and positive operating leverage somewhere in the 2% to 4% range. Now we still expect our net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the current price of oil, we would expect to be at the top end of that range. 
In closing, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year. The investments we made in 2015 positions us well for 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. I will now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

Let me go ahead and answer that first part of the question, and I'll address the second part. The first part was an energy credit that's been around for a few years with M&A activity, which originally led to the credit. It is a Shared National Credit. There are 5 banks involved. And we saw some distress in this credit in the early part of the year, so we have been working this credit really hard during the course of the year. And it simply came to conclusion near the end of the year. And what we've done is we have appropriately marked that credit. We've taken the loss on that credit, as you've heard, and we've moved the residual balance into our held for sale, and we anticipate that we will have that out of our held-for-sale numbers by the end of -- we're hoping January, but certainly this quarter, it will be out of our numbers. And back to individual credit, the charge-off on that was approximately $25 million, just for rounding. In terms of how we think about our reserve and look at prices as we work our way through our process, in the backs of our minds, if we look at our price deck, our price deck is roughly $36 right now; sensitivity, $28.90. So we're looking in that range as we determine and establish what those numbers should be, but we're also looking very heavily at each and every individual customer, what their cash flow looks like, what our collateral looks like, what our asset coverage is. We currently have asset coverage of 1.71x on the E&P book as an example. So again, in conversations, and we have them ongoing, conversations with our customers because we really do have a small number of customers, we still believe that repayment ability is adequate with them and again establish our reserves accordingly."

So 3.13% would have made us flat, and we're looking for a relatively stable -- and just to remind everybody, that's been 1 or 2 points either side of where we are for 2016.

I'll be happy to answer that. As we do our redeterminations, and we just finished up our fall redeterminations just about done, what happens is as you readjust the borrowing base, and again, for fall redeterminations this year, borrowing base adjustments downwards were a little under 8%, notwithstanding if that causes an overadvance, what we will immediately do is call that loan a criticized loan and move it into a nonpass category. So again, that would account for the reason that we have roughly 48% of our E&P book that is showing right now as criticized. Having said that, we have a rigorous process as well around our oilfield services portfolio. As you can see on the chart that we did provide, 32 customers make up 75% of that portfolio. So we're able to stay in constant and close contact with them. Again, as we see any weakness there, again, we are very quick to move it into a criticized category."

There'll be another roughly $6 million associated with those branches, so it's -- call it $12 million, and we expect to pay -- excuse me, a payback on that of about 2 years, which is what we've had historically.

So from our standpoint, we have one of the strongest levels of common equity Tier 1 of our peer group. We did return 93% of our earnings to our shareholders, which we think was appropriate. And as a result, we didn't want to continue to accrete capital because we felt like we had enough capital to run our business in a prudent manner. So we look at our stresses all the time, not just from a CCAR standpoint. We do that for ourselves to make sure we are managing and optimizing our capital in our company, so that we have enough in times of stress and -- but not too much in terms of ensuring we can have an appropriate return to our shareholders.

First quarter's results reflect a strong start to 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic plan. We are pleased by our continued progress despite challenging and somewhat volatile economic backdrop. For the first quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $257 million and earnings per share totaled $0.20. These results reflect growth in total revenue, lower adjusted expenses and positive operating leverage. Importantly, we continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth by expanding our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and loyalty accounts. A key driver to this success is our ability to leverage our approach to relationship banking. We are pleased that once again, we received external recognition for building a strong customer experience at Regions. This quarter, both the Temkin Group and the Greenwich Associates recognized Regions for providing industry-leading customer experiences. 
Looking at our results further, we achieved total average loan growth of 5% compared to prior year. Consumer Lending is off to a solid start as loan balances exceed $30 billion. We have introduced new initiatives to expand our consumer product offerings, which led to year-over-year growth in Consumer Lending of 5%. Our new point-of-sale initiative within indirect lending led this growth, with more loans that doubled over the prior year exceeding our internal expectations. We do expect continued growth in this product category in 2016.  Indirect dollar lending continues to grow as balances increased over 9% compared to last year. Credit card balances increased modestly as we remain focused on expanding a number of customers that carry and utilize the Regions credit card. And we have experienced success on this front as our penetration rate of deposit customers has increased 140 basis points from 1 year ago and now stands at 17.5%. We're also focused on expanding our direct Consumer Lending capabilities, as we recently announced an agreement with Avante. This arrangement allows us to offer additional alternatives to create strong experiences for our customers and prospects. We also had an encouraging quarter in business lending. With total average loans of 4% over the prior year, all of our business lending areas, Corporate Banking, Commercial Banking and Real Estate Banking achieved growth over the prior year. Total adjusted revenue increased 7% over the first quarter of 2015, reflecting effective execution on our strategic plans to grow and diversify revenue. Investments within capital markets are clearly demonstrating progress as capital markets income more than doubled for the first quarter of '15.  Importantly, our efficiency initiatives are allowing us to self-fund these investments as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the previous quarter.
We ended the quarter with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 60.6% an improvement of 200 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. With respect to the current environment, we continue to expect the U.S. economy to demonstrate progress within a measured pace. The global and macroeconomic environment remains a concern, but we do expect modest improved low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. Consequently we continue to closely monitor our direct energy portfolio, as well as portfolios subject to contagion. As expected, there continues to be downward migration and risk ratings. We are supporting and working closely with our customers as they take appropriate and constructive actions to lower cost, reduce debt and improve liquidity. We do anticipate continued in the sector and will make appropriate adjustments. Additionally, we have established appropriate energy reserves, which now stand at 8% of our direct energy exposure. But more broadly, excluding energy-related industries, we do see continued favorable credit quality in the wholesale and consumer portfolios.
Turning to capital deployment, as you're aware, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month. We continue to deploy our capital effectively through organic growth and invest it strategically in initiatives to increase revenue or reduce expenses. But we also return an appropriate amount of our capital to our shareholders. 
In closing, our solid first quarter results provide evidence that we are successfully executing our strategic plan with a continued commitment to our 3 primary strategic initiatives which are grow and diversify our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan, and we are on track to deliver our long-term performance targets.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will cover the details for the first quarter."
271409,328570866,958977,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2016",2016-04-15,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the first quarter, up $750 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending average balances",2107,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the first quarter, up $750 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending average balances increased to $51 billion, up 1% from the previous quarter and 4% over the prior year. Commercial loans grew $373 million or 1%, was driven by Corporate Banking and Real Estate Banking. Specialized lending also contributed to loan growth, driven by new relationships in Technology & Defense, restaurant, as well as an increase in line utilization in Energy & Natural Resources. Commitments were flat link quarter and line utilization increased 110 basis points to 47.8%, primarily driven by energy lending, which increased from 53% to 56%.
Total production declined 26% from the prior quarter, and we are beginning to experience softer pipelines in some areas due to less optimistic and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. However, Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 3%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter and 5% over the prior year. Indirect auto lending increased 2% and production increased 4% during the quarter.  Other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $76 million link quarter or 15% as production increased 120%.
Now looking at the credit card portfolio, average balances increased 2% from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing customer base currently stands at 17.5%. Mortgage loan balances increased $75 million and total home equity balances were relatively flat, up $8 million from the previous quarter.
Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $262 million from the previous quarter and increased $2 billion over the prior year. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points and total funding costs remained low at 28 basis points. With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit funded, with 67% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits make up 92% of our total deposits and approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people. Additionally, 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we continue to believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.
So let's see how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $883 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter. However, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $12 million or 1% for the quarter and increased $51 million or approximately 6% compared to the prior year. Higher loan balances and increases in short-term rates, along with items that are unlikely to repeat, including lower premium amortization and higher dividend income related to trading assets were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase. This increase was partially offset by lower dividends recognized on federal reserve stock, higher debt interest expense and 1 less day in the quarter. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.19%. Excluding the impact from the fourth quarter lease adjustment the net interest margin increased by approximately 6 basis points. Five basis points of this increase was attributable to the impact of day count during the quarter and the previously mentioned items that are unlikely to repeat. 
Total noninterest income increased 1% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter, driven by growth in our revenue diversification initiatives as we successfully execute our strategies. In particular, capital markets income was strong on a linked quarter basis up 46%. This was driven by contributions from the recently expanded mergers and acquisition advisory services group. Additionally, revenue was bolstered by fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers, as well as syndicated loan transactions. And due to the nature of the business and the fact that we are building out our capabilities, capital markets income will likely experience some movement from quarter-to-quarter. However, we are very pleased with the impact our added capabilities are producing.
Wealth management also experienced a strong quarter despite a challenging market environment. Income was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due to higher seasonal insurance income and the impact from recent acquisitions. Investment services income was up 7% attributable to an increase in annuity sales. However, investment management and trust fees were negatively impacted by market conditions. Seasonality and posting order changes that went into effect in early November last year impacted service charges which declined 4% from the fourth quarter. Now looking ahead, we expect modest growth in service charges as we benefit from last year's 2% checking account growth and continued account growth in 2016. In addition, seasonal declines in consumer spending drove a decline in card and ATM fees for the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, card and ATM fees increased approximately 12%. Other noninterest income included reductions to revenue of $12 million reflecting market decreases in relation to assets held for certain employee benefits, which is offset in salaries and benefits expense. 
Quarter-over-quarter, mortgage revenue was up 3%. Additionally in the quarter, we purchased the rights to service approximately $2.6 billion of mortgage loans, bringing our total residential servicing portfolio to $40 billion, and we continue -- we will continue to explore and evaluate opportunities to expand our mortgage servicing portfolio.  During the quarter, we also had a $14 million increase in income related to bank owned life insurance. This was primarily attributable to claims benefits, as well as a gain on exchange of policies. Now we expect the run rate going forward will be in the $18 million to $20 million quarterly range.
Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the first quarter were $869 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $843 million, representing a decline of $18 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter as we implement our efficiency initiatives. As previously noted, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced plans to consolidate 29 branches as part of our strategic plan to close 100 to 150 branches. In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded $14 million of property-related expenses, primarily related to the branch consolidation and additional occupancy optimization initiatives. In addition, we incurred $12 million of severance expense related to staffing reductions, and excluding the impact of severance charges in the current and previous quarter, salaries and benefits decreased $9 million or 2% linked quarter, and this decrease was primarily due to the 2% reduction in staffing, as well as lower expenses attributable to market decreases in relation to assets sales for certain employee benefits that I just discussed. This was partially offset by seasonal increases in payroll taxes of $12 million and increased incentives related to fee-based revenue growth.
Professional and legal expenses declined, primarily due to a favorable legal settlement of $7 million, which is not expected to recur going forward.  FDIC fees increased $3 billion from the previous quarter, and as previously disclosed, we expect FDIC fees to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis when the FDIC assessment surcharge is implemented.  Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.6% in the first quarter, driven primarily by growth in new revenue initiatives, which have been funded by expense eliminations. And our plan to become a more efficient organization is well underway.
So let's move to asset quality. Total net charge-offs decreased $10 million to $68 million and represented 34 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $113 million, and our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.41% at the end of the quarter, which compares to 1.36% of total loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase in the allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in direct energy-related loan reserves. Total loan loss allowance for the energy loan portfolio was 8% at the end of the first quarter compared to 6% at the end of the fourth quarter. Beginning primarily in the third quarter of 2015, low oil prices began to drive the migration of a number of large energy credits into credit sized loans, primarily in the exploration and production in oil field services sectors.  Continued low oil prices prompted further migration of some of those credits into classified loans this quarter. As a result, total Business Services criticized and classified loans increased $254 million, including an increase in classified loans of $703 million and a decrease in special mention loans of $449 million. 
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $211 million from the fourth quarter. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans or coverage ratio was 116%. Additionally, troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs declined 2% from the prior quarter.
Now regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices remain volatile, exposures remain manageable. Should prices remain in the $30 to $45 range, we continue to expect losses in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016; and should oil prices averaged $25 per barrel through the end of '17, we would expect incremental losses in the $100 million range. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture are starting to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. However, we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits.
Let's move on to capital liquidity. During the first quarter, we returned $255 million to shareholders including the repurchase of $175 million of common stock and $80 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6%, and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums.
So let me provide an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016, which remain consistent with those we delivered at our Investor Day last fall and also on our earnings call on January. We expect total loans to grow 3% to 5% on an average basis relative to fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Given current softer market conditions in the commercial space, we could track towards the lower end of that range. Regarding deposits, we continue to expect average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range compared to the fourth quarter 2015 average balances.  Now commensurate with loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase 2% to 4% on a full year basis. Should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. In addition, the higher end of the range is more challenging due to the lower dividends on the Federal Reserve stock. Now with respect to the net interest margin, we will likely experience modest pressure if rates remain low. However, further increases in short-term rates will serve to stabilize the margin. As a result of our investments, we continue to grow adjusted noninterest income and expect that in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis. We will continue to make investments in 2016. However, our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is underway, and we expect to achieve 35% to 45% of that number in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from the level in 2015. We expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio less than 63% and positive operating -- positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. We also continue to expect net charge-offs in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we would expect to be at the top end of that range this year.
In closing, the first quarter was a strong start to the year, and we are encouraged by our results. The investments made in 2015 and before position us well for 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

Midstream continues to perform well, and even in a down industry there are some very good customers out there. And the credits that we put on the books, those 4 credits, 3 of them in fact are existing relationships. We know those customers very well.

And good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. First quarter's results reflect a strong start to 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic plan. We are pleased by our continued progres",767,"Thank you, Dana. And good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. First quarter's results reflect a strong start to 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic plan. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic backdrop. For the first quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $257 million and earnings per share totaled $0.20. These results reflect growth in total revenue, lower adjusted expenses and positive operating leverage. Importantly, we continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth by expanding our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and loyalty accounts. A key driver to this success is our ability to leverage our approach to relationship banking. 
We are pleased that once again, we've received external recognition for building a strong customer experience at Regions. This quarter, both the Temkin Group and the Greenwich Associates recognized Regions for providing industry-leading customer experiences. 
Looking at our results further, we achieved total average loan growth of 5% compared to prior year. Consumer lending is off to a solid start as loan balances exceed $30 billion. We have introduced new initiatives to expand our consumer product offerings, which led to year-over-year growth in consumer lending of 5%. Our new point-of-sale initiative within indirect lending led this growth with more loans that doubled over the prior year exceeding our internal expectations. We do expect continued growth in this product category in 2016.  
Indirect dollar lending continues to grow as balances increased over 9% compared to last year. Credit card balances increased modestly as we remain focused on expanding the number of current customers that carry and utilize the Regions credit card. And we have experienced success on this front as our penetration rate of deposit customers has increased 100 basis -- 140 basis points from 1 year ago and now stands at 17.5%. We're also focused on expanding our direct consumer lending capabilities as we recently announced an agreement with Avant. This arrangement allows us to offer additional alternatives to create strong digital experiences for our customers and prospects. We also had an encouraging quarter in business lending. With total average loans of 4% over the prior year, all of our business lending areas, Corporate Banking, Commercial Banking and Real Estate Banking achieved growth over the prior year. 
Total adjusted revenue increased 7% over the first quarter of 2015, reflecting effective execution on our strategic plans to grow and diversify revenue. Investments within capital markets are clearly demonstrating progress as capital markets income more than doubled versus first quarter of '15. Importantly, our efficiency initiatives are allowing us to sub-fund these investments as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the previous quarter.
We ended the quarter with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 60.6% an improvement of 280 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. With respect to the current environment, we continue to expect the U.S. economy to demonstrate progress, but at a measured pace. The global and macroeconomic environment remains a concern, but we do expect modest improvement. 
Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. Consequently we continue to closely monitor our direct energy portfolio as well as portfolios subject to contagion. As expected, there continues to be downward migration in risk ratings. We are supporting and working closely with our customers as they take appropriate and constructive actions to lower cost, reduce debt and improve liquidity. We do anticipate continued stress in the sector, and we'll make appropriate adjustments. Additionally, we have established appropriate energy reserves, which now stand at 8% of our direct energy exposure. But more broadly, excluding energy-related industries, we do see continued favorable credit quality in the wholesale and consumer portfolios.
Turning to capital deployment, as you're aware, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month. We continue to deploy our capital effectively through organic growth and investing strategically in initiatives to increase revenue or reduce expenses, but we also return an appropriate amount of our capital to shareholders. 
In closing, our solid first quarter results provide evidence that we are successfully executing our strategic plan with a continued commitment to our 3 primary strategic initiatives, which are grow and diversify our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan, and we are on track to deliver our long-term performance targets.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will cover the details for the first quarter."
271409,328570866,959005,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2016",2016-04-15,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the first quarter, up $750 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending average balances",2115,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the first quarter, up $750 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending average balances increased to $51 billion, up 1% from the previous quarter and 4% over the prior year. Commercial loans grew $373 million or 1%. It was driven by Corporate Banking and Real Estate Banking. Specialized lending also contributed to loan growth, driven by new relationships in Technology & Defense, restaurant as well as an increase in line utilization in Energy & Natural Resources. Commitments were flat linked quarter and line utilization increased 110 basis points to 47.8%, primarily driven by energy lending, which increased from 53% to 56%.
Total production declined 26% from the prior quarter, and we are beginning to experience softer pipelines in some areas due to less optimistic and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. However, Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 3%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter and 5% over the prior year. Indirect auto lending increased 2% and production increased 4% during the quarter.  Other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $76 million linked quarter or 15% as production increased 120%.
Now looking at the credit card portfolio, average balances increased 2% from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing customer base currently stands at 17.5%. Mortgage loan balances increased $75 million and total home equity balances were relatively flat, up $8 million from the previous quarter.
Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $262 million from the previous quarter and increased $2 billion over the prior year. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points and total funding costs remained low at 28 basis points. With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit funded, with 67% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits make up 92% of our total deposits and approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people. Additionally, 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we continue to believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.
So let's see how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $883 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter. However, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $12 million or 1% for the quarter and increased $51 million or approximately 6% compared to the prior year. Higher loan balances and increases in short-term rates, along with items that are unlikely to repeat, including lower premium amortization and higher dividend income related to trading assets were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase. This increase was partially offset by lower dividends recognized on Federal Reserve stock, higher debt interest expense and 1 less day in the quarter. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.19%. Excluding the impact from the fourth quarter lease adjustment, the net interest margin increased by approximately 6 basis points. Now 5 basis points of this increase was attributable to the impact of day count during the quarter and the previously mentioned items that are unlikely to repeat. 
Total noninterest income increased 1% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter, driven by growth in our revenue diversification initiatives as we successfully execute our strategies. In particular, capital markets income was strong on a linked quarter basis, up 46%. This was driven by contributions from the recently expanded mergers and acquisition advisory services group. Additionally, revenue was bolstered by fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers as well as syndicated loan transactions. And due to the nature of the business and the fact that we are building out our capabilities, capital markets income will likely experience some movement from quarter-to-quarter. However, we are very pleased with the impact our added capabilities are producing.
Wealth management also experienced a strong quarter despite a challenging market environment. Income was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due to higher seasonal insurance income and the impact from recent acquisitions. Investment services income was up 7% attributable to an increase in annuity sales. However, investment management and trust fees were negatively impacted by market conditions. Seasonality and posting order changes that went into effect in early November last year impacted service charges, which declined 4% from the fourth quarter. Now looking ahead, we expect modest growth in service charges as we benefit from last year's 2% checking account growth and continued account growth in 2016. In addition, seasonal declines in consumer spending drove a decline in card and ATM fees for the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, card and ATM fees increased approximately 12%. Other noninterest income included reductions to revenue of $12 million, reflecting market decreases in relation to assets held for certain employee benefits, which is offset in salaries and benefits expense. 
Quarter-over-quarter, mortgage revenue was up 3%. Additionally in the quarter, we purchased the rights to service approximately $2.6 billion of mortgage loans, bringing our total residential servicing portfolio to $40 billion, and we continue -- we will continue to explore and evaluate opportunities to expand our mortgage servicing portfolio. During the quarter, we also had a $14 million increase in income related to bank-owned life insurance. This was primarily attributable to claims benefits as well as a gain on exchange of policies. Now we expect the run rate going forward will be in the $18 million to $20 million quarterly range.
Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the first quarter were $869 million. And on an adjusted basis, expenses totaled 4 -- $843 million, representing a decline of $18 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter as we implement our efficiency initiatives. As previously noted, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced plans to consolidate 29 branches as part of our strategic plan to close 100 to 150 branches. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded $14 million of property-related expenses, primarily related to the branch consolidation and additional occupancy optimization initiatives. In addition, we incurred $12 million of severance expense related to staffing reductions. And excluding the impact of severance charges in the current and previous quarter, salaries and benefits decreased $9 million or 2% linked quarter. And this decrease was primarily due to the 2% reduction in staffing as well as lower expenses attributable to market decreases in relation to asset sales for certain employee benefits that I just discussed. This was partially offset by seasonal increases in payroll taxes of $12 million and increased incentives related to fee-based revenue growth.
Professional and legal expenses declined, primarily due to a favorable legal settlement of $7 million, which is not expected to recur going forward. FDIC fees increased $3 billion from the previous quarter. And as previously disclosed, we expect the FDIC fees to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis when the FDIC assessment surcharge is implemented. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.6% in the first quarter, driven primarily by growth in new revenue initiatives, which have been funded by expense eliminations. And our plan to become a more efficient organization is well underway.
So let's move to asset quality. Total net charge-offs decreased $10 million to $68 million and represented 34 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $113 million, and our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.41% at the end of the quarter, which compares to 1.36% of total loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase in the allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in direct energy-related loan reserves. Total loan loss allowance for the energy loan portfolio was 8% at the end of the first quarter compared to 6% at the end of the fourth quarter. Beginning primarily in the third quarter of 2015, low oil prices began to drive the migration of a number of large energy credits into credit-sized loans, primarily in the exploration and production in oil field services sectors.  
Continued low oil prices prompted further migration of some of those credits into classified loans this quarter. As a result, total business services criticized and classified loans increased $254 million, including an increase in classified loans of $703 million and a decrease in special mention loans of $449 million. 
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $211 million from the fourth quarter. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans or coverage ratio was 116%. Additionally, troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs declined 2% from the prior quarter.
Now regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices remain volatile, exposures remain manageable. Should prices remain in the $30 to $45 range, we continue to expect losses in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016; and should oil prices averaged $25 per barrel through the end of '17, we would expect incremental losses in the $100 million range. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture are starting to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. However, we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits.
Let's move on to capital liquidity. During the first quarter, we returned $255 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of $175 million of common stock and $80 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6%, and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums.
So let me provide an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016, which remain consistent with those we delivered at our Investor Day last fall and also on our earnings call on January. We expect total loans to grow 3% to 5% on an average basis relative to fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Given current softer market conditions in the commercial space, we could track towards the lower end of that range. 
Regarding deposits, we continue to expect average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range compared to the fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Now commensurate with loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase 2% to 4% on a full year basis. Should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. 
In addition, the higher end of the range is more challenging due to the lower dividends on the Federal Reserve stock. Now with respect to the net interest margin, we will likely experience modest pressure if rates remain low. However, further increases in short-term rates will serve to stabilize the margin. As a result of our investments, we continue to grow adjusted noninterest income in the 4 -- and expect that in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis. 
We will continue to make investments in 2016. However, our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is underway, and we expect to achieve 35% to 45% of that number in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from the level in 2015. We expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio less than 63% and positive operating -- positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. We also continue to expect net charge-offs in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we would expect to be at the top end of that range this year.
In closing, the first quarter was a strong start to the year, and we are encouraged by our results. The investments made in 2015 and before, position us well for 2016 and beyond. And we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

And in terms of the guidance that we've given relative to charge-offs for the rest of the year, again we've run our models, we feel very good about where our numbers are. We do still anticipate that there'll be volatility in the oil prices. And again, that's the reason that we're looking at a price -- or a $25 a barrel over the next 2 years, which would again create $100 million of incremental loss, we think, next year and $50 to $75 this year."

We continue to stress our portfolio to what we think the possibilities of volatility are. And so if it turns out to be stable at a higher point, then I think that's a good day for our customers and a good day for us. But we aren't necessarily trying to anticipate it in our credit review process."

Midstream continues to perform well, and even in a down industry there are some very good customers out there. And the credits that we put on the books, those 4 credits, 3 of them in fact were to existing relationships. We knew those customers very well. One was a new customer that we've been courting for a while, very pleased with the quality of the credit that we've done.

What I can tell you about the draws and the utilization is as we look at the energy and production customers, the E&P customers, again they're governed by borrowing base. So we see some natural ability for draws not to happen there. And then as we look at our oilfield services customers, we have a number of covenants, a number of leverage covenants that are there. We also have anti-cash hoarding provisions that we have been putting in for the last several months as accounts have been coming up for renewal.

There are some new things like our M&A advisory group that just came on board in the fourth quarter. They had a pretty solid first quarter, as we mentioned. We expect that to continue to grow.

Firstly, in total, the metals and mining is about an $800 million portfolio, with durable goods about $110 million in primary metals, just under $500 million, $480 million. And we are seeing some pressure in terms of migration into other asset class -- or for [indiscernible] classes. And again, that's tied some of it to energy, and as I think of a customer to build, physically manufacture the pipeline, some of those customers clearly have reduced demand, of course you've got the pressure because of the strong U.S. dollar and the pressure of what's going on in places like China. So we do see more of that migrating over into the non-pass rated categories. Again our sense around losses on that still goes back to our overall range of 25 to 35 basis points for the year, and that would incorporate the views on that. Our ag portfolio is roughly $800 million as well. We're primarily in row crops. And what we see there again is pressure on those commodities, again given what's going on globally."

Capital markets revenues have a tendency to move around a bit, just depends on when transactions get closed. So you could see that move somewhat. Mortgage is susceptible to the rate environment as we see. We feel good, second, third quarters are always strong quarters in mortgage. So we feel good there. But you have things like from the trust standpoint, it continues a little bit on where the market goes. So and of course we had the bank-owned life insurance. I think we carve that out as not going to recur. So I think that we feel good about the investments what we made. We feel good about the performance of those investments.

The question is what pace will we have to get there. So if you just think about our payout being in the mid-90s last year, and growing our loan portfolio 5%, let's just call at $4 billion for easy math, that's about 40 basis points of capital. So doing -- we're doing right now, we'll continue to get our capital ratio down. And for us, we want to make appropriate investments. We understand, we trade below tangible book value, it's pretty good investment to buy your shares back which is why we have been doing what we're doing. And you should continue to expect that we have an appropriate return to our shareholders. Although our focus really is to use our capital for organic growth. Our capital is to be used to expand our business, to grow new revenue, to make investments in technology and process improvement. And of course pay an appropriate dividend to our shareholders and then after that, there's an excess capital in earnings, and it's repurchasing shares from our shareholder, which is what we did last year and you should expect that same approach this year."

And as the tenure does pick back up then you would see that manifest itself in 2 ways. One, better reinvestment rates and two, lower premium amortization. And we're forecasting our premium amortization to go up because of the reduction in the tenure. But that can be short lived, as you know, pretty volatile. And we're positioned exactly where we want to be, and it's -- it was intentional and we think it was the right thing to do for us."

I mean, if you look at our loan portfolio almost every category is now growing and the vast majority of the markets we operate in are showing that loan growth. But the one lending segment that's been slowed to demonstrate growth has been the owner-occupied space, which is predominantly small to medium-sized businesses. And a lot of that is in amortizing portfolio that's used to expand plant and equipment. We've still not seen that small business owner return to the market with a courage to invest and expand. We keep thinking we'll reach a pivot point in that business. Production is remarkably strong, and that part of the business over the last couple of quarters, but outstandings on that bases still continue to decline. We still think our expectations are that it will pivot at some point, but we still think we're a ways away from that."

First quarter's results reflect a strong start to 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic plan. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic backdrop. For the first quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $257 million and earnings per share totaled $0.20. These results reflect growth in total revenue, lower adjusted expenses and positive operating leverage. Importantly, we continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth by expanding our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth accounts. A key driver to this success is our ability to leverage our approach to relationship banking. 
We are pleased that once again, we've received external recognition for building a strong customer experience at Regions. This quarter, both the Temkin Group and the Greenwich Associates recognized Regions for providing industry-leading customer experiences. 
Looking at our results further, we achieved total average loan growth of 5% compared to prior year. Consumer lending is off to a solid start as loan balances exceed $30 billion. We have introduced new initiatives to expand our consumer product offerings, which led to year-over-year growth in consumer lending of 5%. Our new point-of-sale initiative within indirect lending led this growth with more loans that doubled over the prior year exceeding our internal expectations. We do expect continued growth in this product category in 2016.  
Indirect dollar lending continues to grow as balances increased over 9% compared to last year. Credit card balances increased modestly as we remain focused on expanding the number of customers that carry and utilize the Regions credit card. And we have experienced success on this front as our penetration rate of deposit customers has increased 100 basis -- 140 basis points from 1 year ago and now stands at 17.5%. We're also focused on expanding our direct consumer lending capabilities, as we recently announced an agreement with Avant. This arrangement allows us to offer additional alternatives to create strong digital experiences for our customers and prospects. We also had an encouraging quarter in business lending. With total average loans of 4% over the prior year, all of our business lending areas, Corporate Banking, Commercial Banking and Real Estate Banking, achieved growth over the prior year. 
Total adjusted revenue increased 7% over the first quarter of 2015, reflecting effective execution on our strategic plans to grow and diversify revenue. Investments within capital markets are clearly demonstrating progress as capital markets income more than doubled versus first quarter of '15. Importantly, our efficiency initiatives are allowing us to sub-fund these investments as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the previous quarter.
We ended the quarter with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 60.6%, an improvement of 280 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. With respect to the current environment, we continue to expect the U.S. economy to demonstrate progress, but at a measured pace. The global and macroeconomic environment remains a concern, but we do expect modest improvement. 
Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. Consequently we continue to closely monitor our direct energy portfolio as well as portfolios subject to contagion. As expected, there continues to be downward migration in risk ratings. We are supporting and working closely with our customers as they take appropriate and constructive actions to lower cost, reduce debt and improve liquidity. We do anticipate continued stress in the sector, and we'll make appropriate adjustments. Additionally, we have established appropriate energy reserves, which now stand at 8% of our direct energy exposure. But more broadly, excluding energy-related industries, we do see continued favorable credit quality in the wholesale and consumer portfolios.
Turning to capital deployment, as you're aware, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month. We continue to deploy our capital effectively through organic growth and investing strategically in initiatives to increase revenue or reduce expenses, but we also return an appropriate amount of our capital to shareholders. 
In closing, our solid first quarter results provide evidence that we are successfully executing our strategic plan with a continued commitment to our 3 primary strategic initiatives, which are grow and diversify our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan, and we are on track to deliver our long-term performance targets.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will cover the details for the first quarter."
271409,328570866,959029,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2016",2016-04-15,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the first quarter, up $750 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending average balances",2114,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the first quarter, up $750 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending average balances increased to $51 billion, up 1% from the previous quarter and 4% over the prior year. Commercial loans grew $373 million or 1%. It was driven by Corporate Banking and Real Estate Banking. Specialized lending also contributed to loan growth, driven by new relationships in Technology & Defense, restaurant as well as an increase in line utilization in Energy & Natural Resources. Commitments were flat linked quarter, and line utilization increased 110 basis points to 47.8%, primarily driven by energy lending, which increased from 53% to 56%.
Total production declined 26% from the prior quarter, and we are beginning to experience softer pipelines in some areas due to less optimistic and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. However, Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 3%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter and 5% over the prior year. Indirect auto lending increased 2%, and production increased 4% during the quarter. Other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $76 million linked quarter or 15% as production increased 120%.
Now looking at the credit card portfolio, average balances increased 2% from the previous quarter, and our penetration into our existing customer base currently stands at 17.5%. Mortgage loan balances increased $75 million, and total home equity balances were relatively flat, up $8 million from the previous quarter.
Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $262 million from the previous quarter and increased $2 billion over the prior year. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points, and total funding costs remained low at 28 basis points. With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit funded, with 67% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low-cost deposits make up 92% of our total deposits, and approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people. Additionally, 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we continue to believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.
So let's see how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $883 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter. However, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $12 million or 1% for the quarter and increased $51 million or approximately 6% compared to the prior year. Higher loan balances and increases in short-term rates, along with items that are unlikely to repeat, including lower premium amortization and higher dividend income related to trading assets were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase. This increase was partially offset by lower dividends recognized on Federal Reserve stock, higher debt interest expense and 1 less day in the quarter. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.19%. Excluding the impact from the fourth quarter lease adjustment, the net interest margin increased by approximately 6 basis points. Now 5 basis points of this increase was attributable to the impact of day count during the quarter and the previously mentioned items that are unlikely to repeat. 
Total noninterest income increased 1% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter, driven by growth in our revenue diversification initiatives as we successfully execute our strategies. In particular, capital markets income was strong on a linked quarter basis, up 46%. This was driven by contributions from the recently expanded mergers and acquisition advisory services group. Additionally, revenue was bolstered by fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers as well as syndicated loan transactions. And due to the nature of the business and the fact that we are building out our capabilities, capital markets income will likely experience some movement from quarter-to-quarter. However, we are very pleased with the impact our added capabilities are producing.
Wealth management also experienced a strong quarter despite a challenging market environment. Income was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due to higher seasonal insurance income and the impact from recent acquisitions. Investment services income was up 7%, attributable to an increase in annuity sales. However, investment management and trust fees were negatively impacted by market conditions. Seasonality and posting order changes that went into effect in early November last year impacted service charges, which declined 4% from the fourth quarter. Now looking ahead, we expect modest growth in service charges as we benefit from last year's 2% checking account growth and continued account growth in 2016. In addition, seasonal declines in consumer spending drove a decline in card and ATM fees for the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, card and ATM fees increased approximately 12%. Other noninterest income included reductions to revenue of $12 million, reflecting market decreases in relation to assets held for certain employee benefits, which is offset in salaries and benefits expense. 
Quarter-over-quarter, mortgage revenue was up 3%. Additionally in the quarter, we purchased the rights to service approximately $2.6 billion of mortgage loans, bringing our total residential servicing portfolio to $40 billion, and we continue -- we will continue to explore and evaluate opportunities to expand our mortgage servicing portfolio. During the quarter, we also had a $14 million increase in income related to bank-owned life insurance. This was primarily attributable to claims benefits as well as a gain on exchange of policies. Now we expect the run rate going forward will be in the $18 million to $20 million quarterly range.
Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the first quarter were $869 million. And on an adjusted basis, expenses totaled 4 -- $843 million, representing a decline of $18 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter as we implement our efficiency initiatives. As previously noted, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced plans to consolidate 29 branches as part of our strategic plan to close 100 to 150 branches. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded $14 million of property-related expenses, primarily related to the branch consolidation and additional occupancy optimization initiatives. In addition, we incurred $12 million of severance expense related to staffing reductions. And excluding the impact of severance charges in the current and previous quarter, salaries and benefits decreased $9 million or 2% linked quarter. And this decrease was primarily due to the 2% reduction in staffing as well as lower expenses attributable to market decreases in relation to asset sales for certain employee benefits that I just discussed. This was partially offset by seasonal increases in payroll taxes of $12 million and increased incentives related to fee-based revenue growth.
Professional and legal expenses declined, primarily due to a favorable legal settlement of $7 million, which is not expected to recur going forward. FDIC fees increased $3 billion from the previous quarter. And as previously disclosed, we expect FDIC fees to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis when the FDIC assessment surcharge is implemented. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.6% in the first quarter, driven primarily by growth in new revenue initiatives, which have been funded by expense eliminations. And our plan to become a more efficient organization is well underway.
So let's move to asset quality. Total net charge-offs decreased $10 million to $68 million and represented 34 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $113 million, and our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.41% at the end of the quarter, which compares to 1.36% of total loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase in the allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in direct energy-related loan reserves. Total loan loss allowance for the energy loan portfolio was 8% at the end of the first quarter compared to 6% at the end of the fourth quarter. Beginning primarily in the third quarter of 2015, low oil prices began to drive the migration of a number of large energy credits into criticized loans, primarily in the exploration and production and oil field services sectors.  
Continued low oil prices prompted further migration of some of those credits into classified loans this quarter. As a result, total business services criticized and classified loans increased $254 million, including an increase in classified loans of $703 million and a decrease in special mention loans of $449 million. 
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $211 million from the fourth quarter. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans or coverage ratio was 116%. Additionally, troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs declined 2% from the prior quarter.
Now regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices remain volatile, exposures remain manageable. Should prices remain in the $30 to $45 range, we continue to expect losses in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016; and should oil prices averaged $25 per barrel through the end of '17, we would expect incremental losses in the $100 million range. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture are starting to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. However, we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits.
Let's move on to capital liquidity. During the first quarter, we returned $255 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of $175 million of common stock and $80 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6%, and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums.
So let me provide an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016, which remain consistent with those we delivered at our Investor Day last fall and also on our earnings call on January. We expect total loans to grow 3% to 5% on an average basis relative to fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Given current softer market conditions in the commercial space, we could track towards the lower end of that range. 
Regarding deposits, we continue to expect average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range compared to the fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Now commensurate with loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase 2% to 4% on a full year basis. Should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. 
In addition, the higher end of the range is more challenging due to the lower dividends on the Federal Reserve stock. Now with respect to the net interest margin, we will likely experience modest pressure if rates remain low. However, further increases in short-term rates will serve to stabilize the margin. As a result of our investments, we continue to grow adjusted noninterest income in the 4 -- and expect that in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis. 
We will continue to make investments in 2016. However, our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is underway, and we expect to achieve 35% to 45% of that number in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from the level in 2015. We expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio less than 63% and positive operating -- positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. We also continue to expect net charge-offs in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we would expect to be at the top end of that range this year.
In closing, the first quarter was a strong start to the year, and we are encouraged by our results. The investments made in 2015 and before position us well for 2016 and beyond. And we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

Midstream continues to perform well, and even in a down industry there are some very good customers out there. And the credits that we put on the books, those 4 credits, 3 of them in fact were to existing relationships. We knew those customers very well. One was a new customer that we've been courting for a while, very pleased with the quality of the credit that we've done.

What I can tell you about the draws and the utilization is as we look at the energy and production customers, the E&P customers, again they're governed by borrowing base. So we see some natural ability for draws not to happen there. And then as we look at our oilfield services customers, we have a number of covenants, a number of leverage covenants that are there.

There's timing differences that can get into our numbers. If you read our supplement carefully you'll see there are some timing differences there as well. We are very pleased with the progress we've made on controlling our expenses in this first quarter. And I see that continuing throughout the year and, frankly, through years to come as we have our $300 million expense program. But remember, the point of that is not just to improve efficiency. It's really to make room for the investments we want to make to continue to grow and diversify our revenue stream, and you'll see continued investments there. There are some new things like our M&A advisory group that just came on board in the fourth quarter. They had a pretty solid first quarter, as we’ve mentioned. We expect that to continue to grow. And you'll see the revenue grow, but you'll see expenses associated with that business continuing to grow as well. So we think it is more appropriate to go back to the 63% or less efficiency ratio versus leveraging the 60.6%."

And just to be clear, our focus is on debt capital markets platform. David mentioned Morgan Keegan, there are a number of things that we used to do that we don't aspire to do, but I would say that as we think about building out that debt capital markets platform with a focus on meeting customer needs, other capabilities are fixed income sales and trading. Today, we participate in fixed income underwritings. We’d like to lead those opportunities. Just as our syndications revenue is growing as we win more lead roles, we want to be and lead those fixed income underwrites as well. So that's one capability we don't have today, we'll have, hopefully in the near future. Low income housing tax credit is a really good business for us. We'd like to have some syndication capabilities as we think about building out our origination and distribution model. And so we see a lot of upside and capital markets and debt capital markets revenue over time. But we will be thoughtful in that regard. We're trying to diversify our revenues across a wide spectrum of services for our customers. And to David's point, the most important part is to build capabilities to service our customers."

And we think that the fundamentals performance that we're seeing in the first quarter should continue into the second quarter. As we mentioned earlier, we have seen a softness in our sales pipelines in the first quarter, which should make second quarter a little more uncertain than we had liked. But I would tell you that we continue to be encouraged by the progress we're making. We don't think there's been any impact of TRID at this point in time, and don't anticipate that in the second quarter. But continue to make mortgage -- continuing to make progress.

We're seeing very strong liquidity metrics on the consumer side, and we're also seeing the number of active cards, both debit cards and credit cards, number of active cards are up as well as the number of transactions for cards are up. I would comment that credit card balances are up modestly. It's usually a seasonal time of the year, but we saw average credit card balances up 2% to 3%. We're probably up 8% year-over-year, but that's in the face of strong double-digit transaction activity on cards, but customers are being officially -- fiscally conservative, and we're not seeing balances go up remarkably.

Second quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2006 [ph] and illustrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic priorities. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic background. For the second quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $259 million and earnings per share of $0.20. We continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth. We expanded our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth relationships. Our approach to relationship banking and customer service excellence is instrumental to our success, and we are always pleased to receive external recognition of these efforts. In that regard, the Reputation Institute and the American Banker Magazine recently ranked Regions as the most reputable U.S. bank overall and for the second consecutive year the most reputable among customers. We are honored to again receive this top ranking as it recognized the efforts of all Regions associates in identifying and meeting the needs of our customers and communities we serve. 
Another outstanding recognition came from Temkin Group, which ranked Regions among the top 10% of companies they rated in 2016 as we ranked second in the nation for online experience. 
Looking further at our results, we achieved total average loan growth of 4% compared to the prior year. Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains a bright spot. To that end, consumer loans increased 5% year-over-year with loan balances up in every asset category. And our consumer credit metrics continue to improve. Consumer net charge-offs decreased 5% from the second quarter last year. Nonaccrual consumer loans decreased 16%. Delinquencies decreased 5%, and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4%. Active credit cards increased 12% year-over-year while active debit cards increased 4%. Total transactions on cards increased 6% and total spend is up 5%. Further, average consumer deposits were up 3% year-over-year, including savings deposits were up 9%. 
Turning to business lending. Average loans increased 3% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter, we are experiencing some softness in our commercial lending pipelines. Still strong, but soft. In some areas, customer sentiment continues to reflect less optimism and more uncertainty in the economy. And we have yet to see small business owners really return to market with confidence to invest and expand. 
We are also exercising caution and discipline as we approach internal concentration risk lending limits with certain segments and certain geographies. And as we've highlighted recently at Investor Day, we continued to strengthen our loan portfolio and our focus on migrating credit-only relationships, recycling that capital into more profitable and deeper relationships that result in a better portfolio overall. As a result, and as previously disclosed, we expect it track towards the lower end of our 3% to 5% average loan growth for 2016. 
Despite softer business loan demand, total adjusted revenue increased 4% over the second quarter '15, reflecting the effective execution of our strategic plan to grow and diversify our revenue. Our investments are clearly paying off as capital markets increased 41% and Wealth Management increased 6% on a year-over-year basis. 
With respect to market conditions, the global and macroeconomic environment does remain challenging. As such, it's critical in this operating environment that we focus on what we can control. To that end, we remain committed and focused on disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. For the first 6 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.3%, and we have generated 4% positive operating leverage on adjusted basis. 
With respect to energy lending, while oil prices have improved, lower prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. While on a point-to-point basis, our direct energy loans have declined $324 million or 12% for the first quarter and currently stand at $2.4 billion or 2.9% of total loans. Additionally, we continue to maintain appropriate energy reserves, which now stand at 9.4% of our direct energy exposure, up from 8% last quarter. The percentage increase is probably due to the decline in direct energy loan balances. Further, we are substantially complete with our spring redetermination, to which after to date resulted in a 22% decline in customer borrowing basis.
Turning to capital deployment, we successfully completed the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process or CCAR and received no objection to our planned capital actions. As in last week, our Board of Directors approved the $0.065 dividend on common shares and $640 million share repurchase plan. We remain committed as a team to deploying our capital effectively for organic growth as strategic initiatives that increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses while returning an appropriate amount of capital generated to our shareholders. 
In closing, our second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities and our continued commitment to our 3 primary initiatives, which are: growing and diversifying our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to our success, and we remain on track to deliver our performance targets. 
With that, I'll turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the second quarter."
271409,367089830,1007907,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Now let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as",2135,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Now let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 20%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of $303 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending as balances increased $162 million linked-quarter, reflecting a 49% seasonal increase in production. Indirect auto lending increased $93 million and production increased 4% during the quarter as we continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network. Other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $87 million linked-quarter or 15%. 
Turning to the credit card portfolio. Average balances increased $16 million from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 17.7%, an improvement of 20 basis points. Total home equity balances decreased $87 million from the previous quarter as the pace of runoff exceeded production. As Grayson mentioned, we continue to experience softer pipelines in the commercial space. As a result, total business lending average balances were relatively stable with the previous quarter. Average commercial loans grew $178 million linked-quarter, inclusive of a $64 million decline in average direct energy loans. The net increase in average commercial loans was driven by Corporate Banking as our specialized industry segments added new relationships within Technology & Defense and financial services, and commitments and line utilization were relatively flat with previous quarter. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances decreased $253 million from the previous quarter. Deposit costs remain near historically low levels at 12 basis points, reflecting the strength of our deposit base. And total funding costs continue to remain low, totaling 29 basis points in the second quarter. With respect to deposits, loan growth expectation provided the opportunity to accelerate our planned reduction of certain deposits within our Wealth Management and corporate segments, which contributed to the overall decline in deposit balances. Within Wealth Management, certain trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, were moved into other fee income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the consumer segment increased $1.2 billion or 2% from the previous quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. Our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low -- loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%. 
Let's see how this all impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $869 million, decreasing 2% from the first quarter, but up 4% compared to the prior year. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.15%. And as you recall, the first quarter benefited from items that were not expected to repeat, which partially contributed to the linked-quarter declines in net interest income and other financing income as well as the net interest margin. 
Recent long-term debt issuances, lower loan fees and less favorable credit-related interest recoveries, along with reduced dividends from trading assets that benefited the first quarter were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter decrease. Now these were partially offset by higher loan balances. 
Noninterest income growth was strong in the second quarter, reflecting our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify noninterest revenue. Total noninterest income increased 2% on an adjusted basis from the first quarter, driven by growth in service charges, mortgage income and card and ATM fees. Service charges increased 4% in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of 2% growth year-to-date in checking accounts again, highlighting the strength of our retail franchise. Mortgage income increased 21% driven by seasonal increase in production. Of note, within total mortgage production, 75% related to purchase activity and 25% related to refinancing. Additionally, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis. As a result, we expect to purchase the rights to service approximately $40 million to $50 million of mortgage loans per month on a go-forward basis. 
Card and ATM income increased 4% during the quarter, driven by 1% increase in active debit cards and an 8% increase in transaction volume. We had another good quarter in capital markets with increased fees from merger and acquisition advisory services. Linked-quarter results declined 7% relative to the prior quarter's strong results. The decline was primarily due to reductions in fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and syndicated loan transactions, which were especially strong in the first quarter. 
Wealth Management income decreased 3% primarily due to seasonal decreases in insurance income. This decrease was partially offset by increased investment management and trust fees. Importantly, despite our reduction in Wealth Management deposits, total assets under administration increased 2% quarter-over-quarter. 
Noninterest income was also impacted by market value adjustments related to assets held for certain employee benefits, which increased $20 million compared to the first quarter. However, this is offset salaries and benefits with no impact to pretax income. 
Bank-owned life insurance decreased this quarter probably due to $14 million in claims benefits and a gain from an exchange of policies recognized in the first quarter. 
Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $889 million, representing a 5.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred $22 million of property-related expenses in connection with the consolidation of approximately 60 branches as well as other occupancy optimization initiatives. These branches are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Including these 60 branches, Regions has announced a consolidation of approximately 90 branches as part of the company's previously disclosed plans to consolidate 100 to 150 branches through 2018. And we continue to expect to be at the higher end of the range. 
Total salaries and benefits increased $5 million from the first quarter, and as previously noted, includes $20 million in additional expense related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other noninterest income, as I've mentioned. In addition, severance-related expenses declined by $11 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of the market value adjustments and severance charges, total salaries and benefits would have declined compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date, staffing levels have declined 4%, serving to lower base salaries and fully offset the impact of the annual merit increase. 
Professional legal expenses increased $8 million, primarily due to $3 million in legal and regulatory charges incurred during the second quarter related to the pending settlement of previously disclosed matters as well as the impact of a $7 million favorable legal settlement recognized in the first quarter. 
FDIC insurance assessments decreased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a $6 million refund related to overpayments in prior periods. As previously disclosed, we expect FDIC insurance assessments to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis, associated with the FDIC surcharge, but we anticipate this will be implemented in the third quarter, resulting in a quarterly FDIC run rate in the $27 million to $30 million range. 
Other expenses increased $25 million, including an $11 million increase to the company's reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $9 million of credit-related charges associated with other real estate and held-for-sale loans. 
Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64% in the second quarter and 62.3% year-to-date. As Grayson mentioned, in this uncertain market environment, we are focused on what we can control. And to that end, disciplined expense management is paramount. Our plan to eliminate $300 million in core expenses through 2018 is well underway. We're also evaluating opportunities to pull forward some of the identified savings as well as challenging our team to thoughtfully identify additional expense eliminations beyond the $300 million previously announced. 
Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $4 million to $72 million and represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses essentially matched charge-offs in the quarter, and our allowance for loan losses, as a percent of total loans, remained unchanged at 1.41%. 
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 3% from the first quarter and troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs increased 4%. Total business services criticized loans increased 1%. These increases reflect global market uncertainty and the strength of the U.S. dollar, along with continued volatility in commodity prices. At quarter-end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans, or coverage ratio, was 112%. We continue to see credit improvement within the consumer portfolio as net charge-offs decreased 24% from the prior quarter. Additionally, consumer TDRs improved linked-quarter while total delinquencies remained relatively stable. 
Within Business Services, we experienced $17 million worth of net charge-offs within the energy portfolio during the quarter. Approximately half were attributable to oil and gas and half were attributable to coal. While oil prices have recently traded around $50 per barrel and are showing signs of stabilization, uncertainty remains. Should prices fall and consistently trade in the $35 to $45 range, we expect additional losses between $50 million and $75 million. However, the time frame for these losses now extends through 2017 as we expect resolution will take longer for certain customers in the portfolio. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 billion. [ph] In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture continues to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. We also continue to monitor investor real estate in energy-related markets. We continue to believe our total allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in these portfolios. Now given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large -- larger dollar commercial credits. 
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of $179 million of common stock and $79 million in dividends, completing our 2015 CCAR capital plan. As Grayson mentioned, we successfully completed our 2016 CCAR process and received no objection to our planned capital actions. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 quarterly dividend on common shares and the $640 million share repurchase plan. Now under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. 
Now let me provide you with an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. Now given softer pipelines in the commercial space, we expect to track towards the lower end of that range. 
Regarding deposits, softer loan growth expectations coupled with the strategic reductions of certain deposits within our Wealth Management corporate banking segments will result in total average deposits remaining relatively stable with fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged. Assuming no rate increases for the remainder of 2016, we expect to be at the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we continue to expect to grow adjusted noninterest income in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis. And given our year-to-date performance, we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is on track. And we continue to expect to achieve a 35% to 45% in 2016. Therefore, total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015. We also expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 63% and adjusted positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. Full year net charge-offs should be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. And given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we continue to expect to be at the top end of that range. 
So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and believe our results demonstrate that we are effectively executing our strategic plan in the context of a difficult operating environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value. 
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

So we had valuation adjustments in total of about $9 million. So your spot on between the 2. That was about $20 million of charge that we had to take during the quarter."

I mean so we've -- over the past 6 years, we've made a lot of changes in people and process. Content of our whole balance sheet has changed dramatically. The most obvious one is the decline in investor real estate, which represented almost 30% of our loans portfolio at one time. Today, it's about, call it, 9% -- right at 9%. The credit discipline that we have with regards to how we approach business is very different. And we feel good. We got our -- we have our hands around our loan portfolio. Energy, energy has been a challenge in our industry and those that participate in it. But our concentration risk management program that we have in place has reduced the impact -- the negative impact we would otherwise have had. Being the large bank headquartered in the Gulf states, we have now about 3% of our loan portfolio in energy. And we've talked about the reserves of 9.4% reserves. So we believe we have that covered. There is some volatility and uncertainty there. We feel like we're on top of that. As we think about our commitment to continue to grow our cash flow or PPNR, look at the investments that we've made over time, those investments are paying off as we continue to grow and diversify our revenue stream. And we've had a fairly consistent margin, if you look at that. And then I'll wrap up with expense management. We have a $300 million target out there. We're -- we've said we'd take 35% to 45% of that in the first year. We're on track of where we want to be. And I gave you guidance as to where we thought we would finish the year. So it's a very different Regions and a very different approach to business and the stability of growth in tangible book value that we've been leveraging our earnings well and returning mid-90% of our capital back to our shareholders in the form of dividend, around 30% of that earnings and 60-plus percent in terms of share buybacks. So we think we're deploying our capital effectively. So good business, good markets, good customers and executing against the strategic plan that we laid out in October for our board and in Investor Day."

And I would expect you can have 4 to 6 more points of compression to the remainder of the year. But as we think about growing NII, we do it from a couple of different spots. One, growing earning assets, which is really on the funding side, the positive side. And then putting those -- that growth in good solid loan growth, where we can get compensated for the risks that we're taking, where we can get compensated for having a full customer relationship versus just renting out the balance sheet from a credit-only standpoint. It's very hard to make money if you're just making loans only. So we're challenging our teams where we have relationship that's a credit-only relationship to figure out how we recycle that capital into a more full-some relationship with the customer. So just because we don't have the loan growth doesn't mean we can't continue to grow NII if we execute that program appropriately. So that's kind of how we think about NII going forward."

Now that will take some work. We'll come back as we get later in the year and start giving you a little better guidance in '17. But we're giving you an update on that. The second would be, there's a -- we had a lot of rationale that went around the $300 million. It was roughly 9% [ph] of our expense base. But we're going to go back and challenge ourselves to think through how we might change that over time. Again, we need to be very thoughtful. We need to make sure we don't benefit the short term at the expense of the long-term franchise building that we're trying to do. We want sustainable franchise value. We don't want just short term. So it gets trickier as we start thinking in these terms, but we believe rates -- you have to have a mindset that rates are going to be lower for longer. And this is something that we can't control.

And so we're seeing that in demand for credit. But at the same time, you'll also hear us talking about making sure that we've got full relationships. And we're getting paid a reasonable return for providing banking services to our clients. So we need a full relationship to do that. The return on a credit-only relationship is just not sufficient. But we also have been very disciplined in making sure that our -- that we have diversity in our balance sheet. And so there's certain asset categories that our risk appetite is fulfilled on. And so we've been more judicious about not adding more of that product tied to our balance sheet. And we're absolutely committed to staying diversified. I think if you look at it today, we would say it's about half and half. About half of it is market and about half of it is disciplines that we are invoking.

Because spread is only a component part of the income we get from the customer basis. The other NIR sources that help round it out. So if, in fact, we had a lower spread asset with a full relationship, we could deal with that. It's having a low spread without the relationship that's a problem. So I think that also how to combat this would be the consumer growth. We grew consumer loans about $300 million. We've had nice production in consumer, where we're getting paid for that risk. And that's helping to combat the downward pressure on loan yields. So our loan yields from the first quarter were only down 2 basis points.

The good old days, it would be over 100% when you can rely on wholesale funding and you can take money out every night and that really -- that market does not operate that way. And so I would say, upper 80s, lower 90s. I do think the constructs of the deposits we have, given the LCR framework, deposits, certain deposits that aren't as useful to us. And in particular, as we think about liquidity, those deposits that are collateralized provide little liquidity value to us, and that value really stems from the diversification of funding more so than actual liquidity [indiscernible] best securities for it. I think you'll see that drift up a bit over time, the pace of which is hard to tell."

We've created a much more favorable mix of deposits. And we've reduced some of our deposits, to David's point, that are less attractive under LCR, but also less attractive, at the end of the day, from a liquidity perspective. And so while our deposits were down modestly at the top of the company this quarter, actually core deposits, core deposits that we find attractive were actually up. And the liquidity of the company actually improved. And so we continue to believe that the core value of this franchise really is as a deposit gatherer. And we continue to have a very good story there and a good message back. And so I think, to David's point, there was a time when you could fund loans in a very different way. But today, best way to fund loans is with core deposits. And we think in that high 80s, low 90s, would optimize the earnings power of this company, but we're going to need good solid organic loan growth to make that occur in."

I think that from our perspective, we continue to see that how you -- the process for consolidating those offices really have to do a lot with customer communication and how you equip and train and staff the receiving offices. And to the extent, if the receiving office is a relatively close proximity, and we would say that close proximity is within 10 miles of the other branch, that you're seeing very, very good success with virtually no losses in customers in that regard, we do think that the alternative channels, ATM, call center, mobile, phone line, all of those other channels provide us an opportunity to provide strong connectivity to the customer. And while we've seen branches losing traffic in the sort of 3% to 5% a year range, we've seen tremendous growth in the online and mobile channel. So we think continuing to add functionality there enhances the customer experience and enhances the retention of those customers. But I would say all of it has to be done. You have to do all those things well in order to have a successful consolidation. But great question. It's one that we continue to adjust and fine-tune on a regular basis."

Second quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2006 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic priorities.

Second quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2006 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic priorities. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic background. 
For the second quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $259 million and earnings per share of $0.20. We continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth. We expanded our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth relationships. Our approach to relationship banking and customer service excellence is instrumental to our success, and we are always pleased to receive external recognition of these efforts. In that regard, the Reputation Institute and the American Banker Magazine recently ranked Regions as the most reputable U.S. bank overall and for the second consecutive year the most reputable among customers. We are honored to again receive this top ranking as it recognized the efforts of all Regions' associates in identifying and meeting the needs of our customers and communities we serve.
Another outstanding recognition came from Temkin Group, which ranked Regions among the top 10% of companies they rated in 2016 as we ranked second in the nation for online experience.
Looking further at our results, we achieved total average loan growth of 4% compared to the prior year. Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains a bright spot. To that end, consumer loans increased 5% year-over-year with loan balances up in every asset category. And our consumer credit metrics continue to improve. Consumer net charge-offs decreased 5% from the second quarter last year. Nonaccrual consumer loans decreased 16%. Delinquencies decreased 5%, and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4%. Active credit cards increased 12% year-over-year while active debit cards increased 4%. Total transactions on cards increased 6% and total spend is up 5%. Further, average consumer deposits were up 3% year-over-year, including savings deposits were up 9%.
Turning to business lending. Average loans increased 3% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter, we are experiencing some softness in our commercial lending pipelines, still strong, but soft. In some areas, customer sentiment continues to reflect less optimism and more uncertainty in the economy. And we have yet to see small business owners really return to the market with confidence to invest and expand.
We are also exercising caution and discipline as we approach internal concentration risk lending limits with certain segments and certain geographies. And as we highlighted recently at Investor Day, we continued to strengthen our loan portfolio and our focus on migrating credit-only relationships, recycling that capital into more profitable and deeper relationships that result in a better portfolio overall. As a result, and as previously disclosed, we expect to track towards lower end of our 3% to 5% average loan growth for 2016.
Despite softer business loan demand, total adjusted revenue increased 4% over the second quarter '15, reflecting the effective execution of our strategic plan to grow and diversify our revenue. Our investments are clearly paying off as capital markets increased 41% and Wealth Management increased 6% on a year-over-year basis. 
With respect to market conditions, the global and macroeconomic environment does remain challenging. As such, it's critical in this operating environment that we focus on what we can control. To that end, we remain committed and focused on disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. For the first 6 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.3%, and we have generated 4% positive operating leverage on adjusted basis.
With respect to energy lending, while oil prices have improved, low prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. While on a point-to-point basis, our direct energy loans have declined $324 million or 12% for the first quarter and currently stand at $2.4 billion or 2.9% of total loans. 
Additionally, we continue to maintain appropriate energy reserves, which now stand at 9.4% of our direct energy exposure, up from 8% last quarter. The percentage increase is primarily due to the decline in direct energy loan balances. Further, we are substantially complete with our spring redeterminations, which to date resulted in a 22% decline in customer borrowing bases.
Turning to capital deployment. We successfully completed the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process or CCAR and received no objection to our planned capital actions. As -- in last week, our Board of Directors approved the $0.065 dividend on common shares and $640 million share repurchase plan. We remain committed as a team to deploying our capital effectively through organic growth and strategic initiatives that increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses while returning an appropriate amount of capital generated to our shareholders.
In closing, our second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities and our continued commitment to our 3 primary initiatives, which are: growing and diversifying our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to our success, and we remain on track to deliver our performance targets.
With that, I'll turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the second quarter."
271409,367089830,1008007,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almo",2131,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 20%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of $303 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending and balances increased $162 million linked-quarter, reflecting a 49% seasonal increase in production. Indirect auto lending increased $93 million and production increased 4% during the quarter, as we continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network. Other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $87 million linked-quarter or 15%. 
Turning to the credit card portfolio. Average balances increased $16 million from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 17.7%, an improvement of 20 basis points. Total home equity balances decreased $87 million from the previous quarter as the pace of runoff exceeded production. As Grayson mentioned, we continue to experience softer pipelines in the commercial space. As a result, total business lending average balances were relatively stable with the previous quarter. Average commercial loans grew $178 million linked-quarter, inclusive of a $64 million decline in average direct energy loans. The net increase in average commercial loans was driven by Corporate Banking as our specialized industry segments added new relationships within Technology & Defense and financial services, and commitments and line utilization were relatively flat with previous quarter.
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances decreased $253 million from the previous quarter. Deposit costs remain near historically low levels at 12 basis points, reflecting the strength of our deposit base. And total funding costs continue to remain low, totaling 29 basis points in the second quarter. With respect to deposits, loan growth expectation provided the opportunity to accelerate our planned reduction of certain deposits within our Wealth Management and corporate segments, which contributed to the overall decline in deposit balances. Within Wealth Management, certain trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, were moved into other fee income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the consumer segment increased $1.2 billion or 2% from the previous quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. Our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low -- loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%.
Let's see how this all impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $869 million, decreasing 2% from the first quarter, but up 4% compared to the prior year. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.15%. And as you recall, the first quarter benefited from items that were not expected to repeat, which partially contributed to the linked-quarter declines in net interest income and other financing income as well as the net interest margin.
Recent long-term debt issuances, lower loan fees and less favorable credit-related interest recoveries, along with reduced dividends from trading assets that benefited the first quarter were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter decrease. Now these were partially offset by higher loan balances.
Noninterest income growth was strong in the second quarter, reflecting our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify noninterest revenue. Total noninterest income increased 2% on an adjusted basis from the first quarter, driven by growth in service charges, mortgage income and card and ATM fees. Service charges increased 4% in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of 2% growth year-to-date in checking accounts again, highlighting the strength of our retail franchise. Mortgage income increased 21%, driven by seasonal increase in production. Of note, within total mortgage production, 75% related to purchase activity and 25% related to refinancing. Additionally, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis. As a result, we expect to purchase the rights to service approximately $40 million to $50 million of mortgage loans per month on a go-forward basis.
Card and ATM income increased 4% during the quarter, driven by 1% increase in active debit cards and an 8% increase in transaction volume. We had another good quarter in capital markets with increased fees from merger and acquisition advisory services. Linked-quarter results declined 7% relative to the prior quarter's strong results. The decline was primarily due to reductions in fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and syndicated loan transactions, which were especially strong in the first quarter.
Wealth Management income decreased 3%, primarily due to seasonal decreases in insurance income. This decrease was partially offset by increased investment management and trust fees. Importantly, despite our reduction in Wealth Management deposits, total assets under administration increased 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Noninterest income was also impacted by market value adjustments related to assets held for certain employee benefits, which increased $20 million compared to the first quarter. However, this still offsets salaries and benefits with no impact to pretax income.
Bank-owned life insurance decreased this quarter, primarily due to $14 million in claims benefits and a gain from an exchange of policies recognized in the first quarter.
Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $889 million, representing a 5.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred $22 million of property-related expenses in connection with the consolidation of approximately 60 branches as well as other occupancy optimization initiatives. These branches are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Including these 60 branches, Regions has announced a consolidation of approximately 90 branches as part of the company's previously disclosed plans to consolidate 100 to 150 branches through 2018. And we continue to expect to be at the higher end of the range.
Total salaries and benefits increased $5 million from the first quarter, and as previously noted, includes $20 million in additional expense related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other noninterest income, as I've mentioned. In addition, severance-related expenses declined by $11 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of the market value adjustments and severance charges, total salaries and benefits would have declined compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date, staffing levels have declined 4%, serving to lower base salaries and fully offset the impact of the annual merit increase. 
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million, primarily due to $3 million in legal and regulatory charges incurred during the second quarter related to the pending settlement of previously disclosed matters as well as the impact of a $7 million favorable legal settlement recognized in the first quarter.
FDIC insurance assessments decreased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a $6 million refund related to overpayments in prior periods. As previously disclosed, we expect FDIC insurance assessments to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis, associated with the FDIC surcharge, but we anticipate this will be implemented in the third quarter, resulting in a quarterly FDIC run rate in the $27 million to $30 million range.
Other expenses increased $25 million, including an $11 million increase to the company's reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $9 million of credit-related charges associated with other real estate and held-for-sale loans.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64% in the second quarter and 62.3% year-to-date. As Grayson mentioned, in this uncertain market environment, we are focused on what we can control. And to that end, disciplined expense management is paramount. Our plan to eliminate $300 million in core expenses through 2018 is well underway. We're also evaluating opportunities to pull forward some of the identified savings as well as challenging our team to thoughtfully identify additional expense eliminations beyond the $300 million previously announced.
Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $4 million to $72 million and represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses essentially matched charge-offs in the quarter, and our allowance for loan losses, as a percent of total loans, remained unchanged at 1.41%.
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 3% from the first quarter and troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs increased 4%. Total business services criticized loans increased 1%. These increases reflect global market uncertainty and the strength of the U.S. dollar, along with continued volatility in commodity prices. At quarter-end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans, or coverage ratio, was 112%. We continue to see credit improvement within the consumer portfolio as net charge-offs decreased 24% from the prior quarter. Additionally, consumer TDRs improved linked-quarter while total delinquencies remained relatively stable.
Within Business Services, we experienced $17 million worth of net charge-offs within the energy portfolio during the quarter. Approximately half were attributable to oil and gas and half were attributable to coal. While oil prices have recently traded around $50 per barrel and are showing signs of stabilization, uncertainty remains. Should prices fall and consistently trade in the $35 to $45 range, we expect additional losses between $50 million and $75 million. However, the time frame for these losses now extends through 2017 as we expect resolution will take longer for certain customers in the portfolio. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture continues to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. We also continue to monitor investor real estate in energy-related markets. We continue to believe our total allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in these portfolios. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large -- larger dollar commercial credits.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of $179 million of common stock and $79 million in dividends, completing our 2015 CCAR capital plan. As Grayson mentioned, we successfully completed our 2016 CCAR process and received no objection to our planned capital actions. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 quarterly dividend on common shares and the $640 million share repurchase plan. Now under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums.
Now let me provide you with an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. Given softer pipelines in the commercial space, we expect to track towards the lower end of that range.
Regarding deposits, softer loan growth expectations coupled with the strategic reductions of certain deposits within our Wealth Management corporate banking segments will result in total average deposits remaining relatively stable with fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged. Assuming no rate increases for the remainder of 2016, we expect to be at the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we continue to expect to grow adjusted noninterest income in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis. And given our year-to-date performance, we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is on track. And we continue to expect to achieve 35% to 45% in 2016. Therefore, total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015. We also expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 63% and adjusted positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. Full year net charge-offs should be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. And given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we continue to expect to be at the top end of that range.
So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and believe our results demonstrate that we are effectively executing our strategic plan in the context of a difficult operating environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value. 
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

This particular quarter, we had really one large credit in the unfunded commitment that caused $11 million increase there. And the charge for that will run through noninterest expense. And you'll see, over quarters, the volatility they -- that can have, pluses and minuses. We expect that credit would fund in the third quarter, and -- but we believe it was important for us to continue to have an unfunded reserve for that today. From an OREO and held-for-sale standpoint, again, just a couple of credits. They happen to be large. And we had some write-downs that we believe needed to take place. So we had valuation adjustments in total of about $9 million. So you're spot on between the 2. That was about $20 million of charge that we had to take during the quarter."

I mean so we've -- over the past 6 years, we've made a lot of changes in people and process. Content of our whole balance sheet has changed dramatically. The most obvious one is the decline in investor real estate, which represented almost 30% of our loans portfolio at one time. Today, it's about, call it, 9% -- right at 9%. The credit discipline that we have with regards to how we approach business is very different. And we feel good. We got our -- we have our hands around our loan portfolio. Energy, energy has been a challenge for our industry and those that participate in it. But our concentration risk management program that we have in place has reduced the impact -- the negative impact we would otherwise have had. Being the largest bank headquartered in the Gulf States, we have now about 3% of our loan portfolio in energy. And we've talked about the reserves of 9.4% reserves. So we believe we have that covered. There is some volatility and uncertainty there. We feel like we're on top of that. As we think about our commitment to continue to grow our cash flow or PPNR, look at the investments that we've made over time, those investments are paying off as we continue to grow and diversify our revenue stream. And we've had a fairly consistent margin, if you look at that. And then I'll wrap up with expense management. We have a $300 million target out there. We're -- we've said we'd take 35% to 45% of that in the first year. We're on track -- where we want to be. And I gave you guidance as to where we thought we would finish the year. So it's a very different Regions and a very different approach to business and the stability of growth in tangible book value that we've been leveraging our earnings well and returning mid-90% of our capital back to our shareholders in the form of dividend, around 30% of that earnings and 60-plus percent and in terms of share buybacks. So we think we're deploying our capital effectively.

And I would expect you can have 4 to 6 more points of compression to the remainder of the year. But as we think about growing NII, we do it from a couple of different spots. One, growing earning assets, which is really on the funding side, the positive side, and then putting those -- that growth in good solid loan growth, where we can get compensated for the risks that we take, where we can get compensated for having a full customer relationship versus just renting out the balance sheet from a credit-only standpoint. It's very hard to make money if you're just making loans-only. So we're challenging our teams where we have a relationship that's a credit-only relationship to figure out how we recycle that capital into a more full-some relationship with the customer.

And clearly, part of the weakness we're seeing is just general market demand for credit. And if you look at the top of company and domestic U.S. numbers, the level of fixed capital spending by wholesale customers continues to be below historical proportions. And so we're seeing that in demand for credit. But at the same time, you'll also hear us talking about making sure that we've got full relationships and we're getting paid a reasonable return for providing banking services to our clients. And so we need a full relationship to do that. The return on a credit-only relationship is just not sufficient. But we also have been very disciplined in making sure that our -- that we have diversity in our balance sheet, and so there's certain asset categories that our risk appetite is fulfilled on. And so we've been more judicious about not adding more of that product type to our balance sheet, and we're absolutely committed to staying diversified. I think if you look at it today, we would say it's about half and half. About half of it's market, and about half of it is disciplines that we are invoking.

But if you're 2.25% over, you're working against yourself. That portfolio yielding -- yields today about 3.5%. And so as we think about how to combat some of these, one is to get deeper relationship. We're not having to look just at spread because the spread is only a component part of the income we get from the customer base. It's the other NIR sources that help round it out. So if, in fact, we had a lower-spread asset with a full relationship, we can deal with that. It's having a low spread without the relationship that's a problem. So I think that also, how to combat this would be the consumer growth. We grew consumer loans about $300 million. We've had nice production in consumer, where we're getting paid for that risk, and that's helping to combat the downward pressure on loan yields. So our loan yields from the first quarter were only down 2 basis points. Part of that's the mix shift and the remixing of business that we're trying to make in our total balance sheet to be more profitable and to get better return to our shareholders."

If you look at the CCAR continuing to address a couple of things there. One, the stresses in each of the portfolios. We have some learnings that we can take from that as we reshape certain of our businesses to take out risk, which then reduces the amount of capital you need to have, in particular, in a stressed environment. We did not have -- go over 100% of earnings. We did have a couple of regional players that did for the first time. For us, we want to make sure we optimize our capital structure in terms of the nature of the components of preferred stock and common stock and the like to make sure that that's optimized. And over time, we'll do that to reduce our cost of equity. But I think working on the stresses inherent in the balance sheet, which we have done, and you've seen that come down in places like commercial real estate, losses came down quite dramatically but still high. And so how do we change our business model over time to reduce the amount of capital we have to have so that we can either put it to work if there's opportunity to grow loans and when there's not, returning that capital to our shareholders, especially when you trade at -- when we trade at tangible book value."

At good old days, we'd be over 100% when you can rely on wholesale funding that you could take money out every night, and that really -- that market doesn't operate that way. So I would say upper 80s, lower 90s. I do think the construct of the deposits we have, given the LCR framework, deposits -- there are certain deposits that aren't as useful to us. And in particular, as we think about liquidity, those deposits that are collateralized provide little liquidity value to us, and that value really stems from the diversification of funding more so than actual liquidity because we're having to post up our best securities for it. So I think you'll see that drift up a bit over time, the pace of which is hard to tell."

We've created a much more favorable mix of deposits, and we've reduced some of our deposits, to David's point, that are less attractive under LCR but also less attractive, at the end of the day, from a liquidity perspective. And so while our deposits were down modestly at the top of the company this quarter, actually, core deposits, core deposits that we find attractive were actually up, and the liquidity of the company actually improved. And so we continue to believe that the core value of this franchise really is as a deposit gatherer. And we continue to have a very good story there and a good message back. And so I think, to David's point, there was a time when you could fund loans in a very different way. But today, the best way to fund loans is with core deposits. And we think in that high 80s, low 90s, we'd optimize the earnings power of this company, but we're going to need good, solid organic loan growth to make that occur."

I think that from our perspective, we continue to see that how you -- the process for consolidating those offices really have to do a lot with customer communication and how you equip and train and staff the receiving offices. And to the extent -- if the receiving offices is a relatively close proximity, and we would say that close proximity is within 10 miles of the other branch, that you're seeing very, very good success with virtually no losses in customers in that regard. We do think that the alternative channels, ATM, call center, mobile, online, all of those other channels provide us an opportunity to provide a strong connectivity to the customer. And while we've seen branches losing traffic in the sort of 3% to 5% a year range, we've seen tremendous growth in the online and mobile channel. So we think continuing to add functionality there enhances the customer experience and enhances the retention of those customers. But I would say all of it has to be done. You have to do all those things well in order to have a successful consolidation. But great question. It's one that we continue to adjust and fine-tune on a regular basis."

          Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Second quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2006 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic priorities. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic background. 
For the second quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $259 million and earnings per share of $0.20. We continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth. We expanded our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth relationships. Our approach to relationship banking and customer service excellence is instrumental to our success, and we are always pleased to receive external recognition of these efforts. In that regard, the Reputation Institute and the American Banker Magazine recently ranked Regions as the most reputable U.S. bank overall and for the second consecutive year the most reputable among customers. We are honored to again receive this top ranking as it recognized the efforts of all Regions' associates in identifying and meeting the needs of our customers and communities we serve.
Another outstanding recognition came from Temkin Group, which ranked Regions among the top 10% of companies they rated in 2016 as we ranked second in the nation for online experience.
Looking further at our results, we achieved total average loan growth of 4% compared to the prior year. Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains a bright spot. To that end, consumer loans increased 5% year-over-year with loan balances up in every asset category. And our consumer credit metrics continue to improve. Consumer net charge-offs decreased 5% from the second quarter last year. Nonaccrual consumer loans decreased 16%. Delinquencies decreased 5%, and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4%. Active credit cards increased 12% year-over-year while active debit cards increased 4%. Total transactions on cards increased 6% and total spend is up 5%. Further, average consumer deposits were up 3% year-over-year, including savings deposits were up 9%.
Turning to business lending. Average loans increased 3% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter, we are experiencing some softness in our commercial lending pipelines, still strong, but soft. In some areas, customer sentiment continues to reflect less optimism and more uncertainty in the economy. And we have yet to see small business owners really return to the market with confidence to invest and expand.
We are also exercising caution and discipline as we approach internal concentration risk lending limits with certain segments and certain geographies. And as we highlighted recently at Investor Day, we continued to strengthen our loan portfolio and our focus on migrating credit-only relationships, recycling that capital into more profitable and deeper relationships that result in a better portfolio overall. As a result, and as previously disclosed, we expect to track towards lower end of our 3% to 5% average loan growth for 2016.
Despite softer business loan demand, total adjusted revenue increased 4% over the second quarter '15, reflecting the effective execution of our strategic plan to grow and diversify our revenue. Our investments are clearly paying off as capital markets increased 41% and Wealth Management increased 6% on a year-over-year basis. 
With respect to market conditions, the global and macroeconomic environment does remain challenging. As such, it's critical in this operating environment that we focus on what we can control. To that end, we remain committed and focused on disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. For the first 6 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.3%, and we have generated 4% positive operating leverage on adjusted basis.
With respect to energy lending, while oil prices have improved, low prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. While on a point-to-point basis, our direct energy loans have declined $324 million or 12% for the first quarter and currently stand at $2.4 billion or 2.9% of total loans. 
Additionally, we continue to maintain appropriate energy reserves, which now stand at 9.4% of our direct energy exposure, up from 8% last quarter. The percentage increase is primarily due to the decline in direct energy loan balances. Further, we are substantially complete with our spring redeterminations, which to date resulted in a 22% decline in customer borrowing bases.
Turning to capital deployment. We successfully completed the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process or CCAR and received no objection to our planned capital actions. As -- in last week, our Board of Directors approved the $0.065 dividend on common shares and $640 million share repurchase plan. We remain committed as a team to deploying our capital effectively through organic growth and strategic initiatives that increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses while returning an appropriate amount of capital generated to our shareholders.
In closing, our second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities and our continued commitment to our 3 primary initiatives, which are: growing and diversifying our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to our success, and we remain on track to deliver our performance targets.
With that, I'll turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the second quarter."

          Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 20%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of $303 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending and balances increased $162 million linked-quarter, reflecting a 49% seasonal increase in production. Indirect auto lending increased $93 million and production increased 4% during the quarter, as we continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network. Other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $87 million linked-quarter or 15%. 
Turning to the credit card portfolio. Average balances increased $16 million from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 17.7%, an improvement of 20 basis points. Total home equity balances decreased $87 million from the previous quarter as the pace of runoff exceeded production. As Grayson mentioned, we continue to experience softer pipelines in the commercial space. As a result, total business lending average balances were relatively stable with the previous quarter. Average commercial loans grew $178 million linked-quarter, inclusive of a $64 million decline in average direct energy loans. The net increase in average commercial loans was driven by Corporate Banking as our specialized industry segments added new relationships within Technology & Defense and financial services, and commitments and line utilization were relatively flat with previous quarter.
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances decreased $253 million from the previous quarter. Deposit costs remain near historically low levels at 12 basis points, reflecting the strength of our deposit base. And total funding costs continue to remain low, totaling 29 basis points in the second quarter. With respect to deposits, loan growth expectation provided the opportunity to accelerate our planned reduction of certain deposits within our Wealth Management and corporate segments, which contributed to the overall decline in deposit balances. Within Wealth Management, certain trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, were moved into other fee income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the consumer segment increased $1.2 billion or 2% from the previous quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. Our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low -- loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%.
Let's see how this all impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $869 million, decreasing 2% from the first quarter, but up 4% compared to the prior year. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.15%. And as you recall, the first quarter benefited from items that were not expected to repeat, which partially contributed to the linked-quarter declines in net interest income and other financing income as well as the net interest margin.
Recent long-term debt issuances, lower loan fees and less favorable credit-related interest recoveries, along with reduced dividends from trading assets that benefited the first quarter were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter decrease. Now these were partially offset by higher loan balances.
Noninterest income growth was strong in the second quarter, reflecting our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify noninterest revenue. Total noninterest income increased 2% on an adjusted basis from the first quarter, driven by growth in service charges, mortgage income and card and ATM fees. Service charges increased 4% in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of 2% growth year-to-date in checking accounts again, highlighting the strength of our retail franchise. Mortgage income increased 21%, driven by seasonal increase in production. Of note, within total mortgage production, 75% related to purchase activity and 25% related to refinancing. Additionally, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis. As a result, we expect to purchase the rights to service approximately $40 million to $50 million of mortgage loans per month on a go-forward basis.
Card and ATM income increased 4% during the quarter, driven by 1% increase in active debit cards and an 8% increase in transaction volume. We had another good quarter in capital markets with increased fees from merger and acquisition advisory services. Linked-quarter results declined 7% relative to the prior quarter's strong results. The decline was primarily due to reductions in fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and syndicated loan transactions, which were especially strong in the first quarter.
Wealth Management income decreased 3%, primarily due to seasonal decreases in insurance income. This decrease was partially offset by increased investment management and trust fees. Importantly, despite our reduction in Wealth Management deposits, total assets under administration increased 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Noninterest income was also impacted by market value adjustments related to assets held for certain employee benefits, which increased $20 million compared to the first quarter. However, this is offset salaries and benefits with no impact to pretax income.
Bank-owned life insurance decreased this quarter, primarily due to $14 million in claims benefits and a gain from an exchange of policies recognized in the first quarter.
Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $889 million, representing a 5.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred $22 million of property-related expenses in connection with the consolidation of approximately 60 branches as well as other occupancy optimization initiatives. These branches are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Including these 60 branches, Regions has announced a consolidation of approximately 90 branches as part of the company's previously disclosed plans to consolidate 100 to 150 branches through 2018. And we continue to expect to be at the higher end of the range.
Total salaries and benefits increased $5 million from the first quarter, and as previously noted, includes $20 million in additional expense related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other noninterest income, as I've mentioned. In addition, severance-related expenses declined by $11 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of the market value adjustments and severance charges, total salaries and benefits would have declined compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date, staffing levels have declined 4%, serving to lower base salaries and fully offset the impact of the annual merit increase. 
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million, primarily due to $3 million in legal and regulatory charges incurred during the second quarter related to the pending settlement of previously disclosed matters as well as the impact of a $7 million favorable legal settlement recognized in the first quarter.
FDIC insurance assessments decreased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a $6 million refund related to overpayments in prior periods. As previously disclosed, we expect FDIC insurance assessments to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis, associated with the FDIC surcharge, but we anticipate this will be implemented in the third quarter, resulting in a quarterly FDIC run rate in the $27 million to $30 million range.
Other expenses increased $25 million, including an $11 million increase to the company's reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $9 million of credit-related charges associated with other real estate and held-for-sale loans.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64% in the second quarter and 62.3% year-to-date. As Grayson mentioned, in this uncertain market environment, we are focused on what we can control. And to that end, disciplined expense management is paramount. Our plan to eliminate $300 million in core expenses through 2018 is well underway. We're also evaluating opportunities to pull forward some of the identified savings as well as challenging our team to thoughtfully identify additional expense eliminations beyond the $300 million previously announced.
Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $4 million to $72 million and represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses essentially matched charge-offs in the quarter, and our allowance for loan losses, as a percent of total loans, remained unchanged at 1.41%.
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 3% from the first quarter and troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs increased 4%. Total business services criticized loans increased 1%. These increases reflect global market uncertainty and the strength of the U.S. dollar, along with continued volatility in commodity prices. At quarter-end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans, or coverage ratio, was 112%. We continue to see credit improvement within the consumer portfolio as net charge-offs decreased 24% from the prior quarter. Additionally, consumer TDRs improved linked-quarter while total delinquencies remained relatively stable.
Within Business Services, we experienced $17 million worth of net charge-offs within the energy portfolio during the quarter. Approximately half were attributable to oil and gas and half were attributable to coal. While oil prices have recently traded around $50 per barrel and are showing signs of stabilization, uncertainty remains. Should prices fall and consistently trade in the $35 to $45 range, we expect additional losses between $50 million and $75 million. However, the time frame for these losses now extends through 2017 as we expect resolution will take longer for certain customers in the portfolio. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture continues to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. We also continue to monitor investor real estate in energy-related markets. We continue to believe our total allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in these portfolios. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large -- larger dollar commercial credits.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of $179 million of common stock and $79 million in dividends, completing our 2015 CCAR capital plan. As Grayson mentioned, we successfully completed our 2016 CCAR process and received no objection to our planned capital actions. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 quarterly dividend on common shares and the $640 million share repurchase plan. Now under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums.
Now let me provide you with an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. Given softer pipelines in the commercial space, we expect to track towards the lower end of that range.
Regarding deposits, softer loan growth expectations coupled with the strategic reductions of certain deposits within our Wealth Management corporate banking segments will result in total average deposits remaining relatively stable with fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged. Assuming no rate increases for the remainder of 2016, we expect to be at the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we continue to expect to grow adjusted noninterest income in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis. And given our year-to-date performance, we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is on track. And we continue to expect to achieve 35% to 45% in 2016. Therefore, total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015. We also expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 63% and adjusted positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. Full year net charge-offs should be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. And given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we continue to expect to be at the top end of that range.
So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and believe our results demonstrate that we are effectively executing our strategic plan in the context of a difficult operating environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value. 
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

          Yes, Marty. This is David. So from time to time, we'll have some credits that go sideways on us. This particular quarter, we had really one large credit in the unfunded commitment that caused $11 million increase there. And the charge for that will run through noninterest expense. And you'll see, over quarters, the volatility they -- that can have, pluses and minuses. We expect that credit would fund in the third quarter, and -- but we believe it was important for us to continue to have an unfunded reserve for that today. From an OREO and held-for-sale standpoint, again, just a couple of credits. They happen to be large. And we had some write-downs that we believe needed to take place. So we had valuation adjustments in total of about $9 million. So you're spot on between the 2. That was about $20 million of charge that we had to take during the quarter."

As you're looking at creating shareholder value, one of the things is probably -- what you've been able to derisk because just getting credit from the tangible book value growth would be an upward momentum for the overall valuation.

          Sure. I mean so we've -- over the past 6 years, we've made a lot of changes in people and process. Content of our whole balance sheet has changed dramatically. The most obvious one is the decline in investor real estate, which represented almost 30% of our loans portfolio at one time. Today, it's about, I'd say, call it, 9% -- right at 9%. The credit discipline that we have with regards to how we approach business is very different. And we feel good. We got our -- we have our hands around our loan portfolio. Energy, energy has been a challenge for our industry and those that participate in it. But our concentration risk management program that we have in place has reduced the impact -- the negative impact we would otherwise have had. Being the largest bank headquartered in the Gulf States, we have now about 3% of our loan portfolio in energy. And we've talked about the reserves -- the 9.4% reserves. So we believe we have that covered. There is some volatility and uncertainty there. We feel like we're on top of that. As we think about our commitment to continue to grow our cash flow, our PPNR, look at the investments that we've made over time, those investments are paying off as we continue to grow and diversify our revenue stream. And we've had a fairly consistent margin, if you look at that. And then I'll wrap up with expense management. We have a $300 million target out there. We're -- we've said we'd take 35% to 45% of that in the first year. We're on track with where we want to be. And I gave you guidance as to where we thought we would finish the year. So it's a very different Regions and a very different approach to business and the stability of growth in tangible book value that we've been leveraging our earnings well and returning mid-90% of our capital back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend, around 30% of that earnings and 60-plus percent and in terms of share buybacks. So we think we're deploying our capital effectively. So good business, good markets, good customers and executing against the strategic plan that we laid out in October for our board and at Investor Day."

I would tell you that in energy it's an obvious place for that has occurred. [ph] But you do see it -- you do see that spread across a number of different commercial industries as there's been obviously the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and some uncertainty created by a lot of events in both globally and domestically. And so I wouldn't say it's limited to one particular industry. It seems to be more broad-based in that. But if you look at credit quality, commercial is still very good. We've had a really good experience now for several quarters in a row. We still expect it to be good, but it's modestly soft, modestly weaker than what we saw a quarter ago.

          Well, certainly, from a NIM standpoint, we're really trying to get growth in NII, but NIM will be continued pressure if this rate environment stays where it is. And I would expect you can have 4 to 6 more points of compression to the remainder of the year. But as we think about growing NII, we do it from a couple of different spots. One, growing earning assets, which is really on the funding side, the deposit side, and then putting those -- that growth in good solid loan growth, where we can get compensated for the risks that we take, where we can get compensated for having a full customer relationship versus just renting out the balance sheet from a credit-only standpoint. It's very hard to make money if you're just making loans-only. So we're challenging our teams where we have a relationship that's a credit-only relationship to figure out how we recycle that capital into a more full-sum relationship with the customer. So just because we don't have the loan growth doesn't mean we can't continue to grow NII if we execute that program appropriately. So that's kind of how we think about NII going forward."

Again, the mix of business that we placed on the books this quarter, about 75% repurchased and about 25% refinanced -- purchased and refinanced. We do expect to have a good third quarter based on what we're seeing today. We have seen a shift in the application volume. I would tell you that instead of getting about 75-25, it appears to be shifting more to 60-40 in terms of purchase versus refinance. So we should see that shift in this quarter, but think we'll have a good quarter. Traditionally, if you look at our numbers, second and third quarter are always our strongest mortgage origination quarters. So absent any change that we don't see today, we think -- you think we ought to have good progress going forward."

And so the question is, what can we do that's prudent, makes sense to move into 2017? That will take some work. We'll come back as we get later in the year and start giving you a little better guidance into '17. We'll give you an update on that. The second would be there's a -- we had a lot of rationale that went around the $300 million. It was roughly 9% of our expense base. But we're going to go back and challenge ourselves to think through how we might change that over time. Again, we need to be very thoughtful. We need to make sure we don't benefit the short term at the expense of the long-term franchise building that we're trying to do. We want sustainable franchise value. We don't want just short-term. So it gets trickier as we start thinking in these terms, but we believe rates -- you have to have a mindset that rates are going to be lower for longer, and this is something we can't control.

          I mean, that's a great question. It's one that we've spent some time ourselves internally sort of discussing and debating. And clearly, part of the weakness we're seeing is just general market demand for credit. And if you look at the top of company and domestic U.S. numbers, the level of fixed capital spending by wholesale customers continues to be below historical proportions. And so we're seeing that in demand for credit. But at the same time, you'll also hear us talking about making sure that we've got full relationships and we're getting paid a reasonable return for providing banking services to our clients. And so we need a full relationship to do that. The return on a credit-only relationship is just not sufficient. But we also have been very disciplined in making sure that our -- that we have diversity in our balance sheet, and so there's certain asset categories that our risk appetite is fulfilled on. And so we've been more judicious about not adding more of that product type to our balance sheet, and we're absolutely committed to staying diversified. I think if you look at it today, we would say it's about half and half. About half of it's market, and about half of it is disciplines that we are invoking. I'd also remind you that when you look at our loan growth for this quarter, keep in mind the reduction in energy loans that we've achieved over the past quarter then has been a -- there's a story there that, without that reduction in energy, growth in our wholesale book would have been much stronger."

          Well, it really just depends, John, in terms of different products. In the C&I space, we haven't seen spreads change dramatically there. But if you're 2.25% over, you're working against yourself. That portfolio yielding -- yields today about 3.5%. And so as we think about how to combat some of this, one is to get deeper relationship. We're not having to look just at spread because the spread is only a component part of the income we get from the customer base. It's the other NIR sources that help round it out. So if, in fact, we had a lower-spread asset with a full relationship, we can deal with that. It's having a low spread without the relationship that's a problem. So I think that also, how to combat this would be the consumer growth. We grew consumer loans about $300 million. We've had nice production in consumer, where we're getting paid for that risk, and that's helping to combat the downward pressure on loan yields. So our loan yields from the first quarter were only down 2 basis points. Part of that's the mix shift and the remixing of business that we're trying to make in our total balance sheet to be more profitable and to get better return to our shareholders."

One, the stresses in each of the portfolios. We have some learnings that we can take from that as we reshape certain of our businesses to take out risk, which then reduces the amount of capital you need to have, in particular, in a stressed environment. We did not have -- go over 100% of earnings. We did have a couple of regional players that did for the first time. For us, we want to make sure we optimize our capital structure in terms of the nature of the components of preferred stock and common stock and the like to make sure that that's optimized. And over time, we'll do that to reduce our cost of equity. But I think working on the stresses inherent in the balance sheet, which we have done, and you've seen that come down in places like commercial real estate, losses came down quite dramatically but still high. And so how do we change our business model over time to reduce the amount of capital we have to have so that we can either put it to work if there's opportunity to grow loans and when there's not, returning that capital to our shareholders, especially when you trade at -- when we trade at tangible book value."

At good old days, we'd be over 100% when you can rely on wholesale funding that you could take money out every night, and that really -- that market doesn't operate that way. So I would say upper 80s, lower 90s. I do think the construct of the deposits we have, given the LCR framework, deposits -- there are certain deposits that aren't as useful to us. And in particular, as we think about liquidity, those deposits that are collateralized provide little liquidity value to us, and that value really stems from the diversification of funding more so than actual liquidity because we're having to post up our best securities for it. So I think you'll see that drift up a bit over time, the pace of which is hard to tell."

We've created a much more favorable mix of deposits, and we've reduced some of our deposits, to David's point, that are less attractive under LCR but also less attractive, at the end of the day, from a liquidity perspective. And so while our deposits were down modestly at the top of the company this quarter, actually, core deposits, core deposits that we find attractive were actually up, and the liquidity of the company actually improved. And so we continue to believe that the core value of this franchise really is as a deposit gatherer. And we continue to have a very good story there and a good message back. And so I think, to David's point, there was a time when you could fund loans in a very different way. But today, the best way to fund loans is with core deposits. And we think in that high 80s, low 90s, we'd optimize the earnings power of this company, but we're going to need good, solid organic loan growth to make that occur."

And to the extent -- if the receiving offices is a relatively close proximity, and we would say that close proximity is within 10 miles of the other branch, that you're seeing very, very good success with virtually no losses in customers in that regard. We do think that the alternative channels, ATM, call center, mobile, online, all of those other channels provide us an opportunity to provide a strong connectivity to the customer. And while we've seen branches losing traffic in the sort of 3% to 5% a year range, we've seen tremendous growth in the online and mobile channel. So we think continuing to add functionality there enhances the customer experience and enhances the retention of those customers. But I would say all of it has to be done. You have to do all those things well in order to have a successful consolidation. But great question. It's one that we continue to adjust and fine-tune on a regular basis."

Second quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2006 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic priorities. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic background.
For the second quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $259 million and earnings per share of $0.20. We continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth. We expanded our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth relationships. Our approach to relationship banking and customer service excellence is instrumental to our success, and we are always pleased to receive external recognition of these efforts. In that regard, the Reputation Institute and the American Banker Magazine recently ranked Regions as the most reputable U.S. bank overall and for the second consecutive year the most reputable among customers. We are honored to again receive this top ranking as it recognized the efforts of all Regions' associates in identifying and meeting the needs of our customers and communities we serve.
Another outstanding recognition came from Temkin Group, which ranked Regions among the top 10% of companies they rated in 2016 as we ranked second in the nation for online experience.
Looking further at our results, we achieved total average loan growth of 4% compared to the prior year. Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains a bright spot. To that end, consumer loans increased 5% year-over-year with loan balances up in every asset category. And our consumer credit metrics continue to improve. Consumer net charge-offs decreased 5% from the second quarter last year. Nonaccrual consumer loans decreased 16%. Delinquencies decreased 5%, and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4%. Active credit cards increased 12% year-over-year while active debit cards increased 4%. Total transactions on cards increased 6% and total spend is up 5%. Further, average consumer deposits were up 3% year-over-year, including savings deposits were up 9%.
Turning to business lending. Average loans increased 3% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter, we are experiencing some softness in our commercial lending pipelines, still strong, but soft. In some areas, customer sentiment continues to reflect less optimism and more uncertainty in the economy. And we have yet to see small business owners really return to the market with confidence to invest and expand.
We are also exercising caution and discipline as we approach internal concentration risk lending limits with certain segments and certain geographies. And as we highlighted recently at Investor Day, we continued to strengthen our loan portfolio and our focus on migrating credit-only relationships, recycling that capital into more profitable and deeper relationships that result in a better portfolio overall. As a result, and as previously disclosed, we expect to track towards lower end of our 3% to 5% average loan growth for 2016.
Despite softer business loan demand, total adjusted revenue increased 4% over the second quarter '15, reflecting the effective execution of our strategic plan to grow and diversify our revenue. Our investments are clearly paying off as capital markets increased 41% and Wealth Management increased 6% on a year-over-year basis.
With respect to market conditions, the global and macroeconomic environment does remain challenging. As such, it's critical in this operating environment that we focus on what we can control. To that end, we remain committed and focused on disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. For the first 6 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.3%, and we have generated 4% positive operating leverage on adjusted basis.
With respect to energy lending, while oil prices have improved, low prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. While on a point-to-point basis, our direct energy loans have declined $324 million or 12% for the first quarter and currently stand at $2.4 billion or 2.9% of total loans.
Additionally, we continue to maintain appropriate energy reserves, which now stand at 9.4% of our direct energy exposure, up from 8% last quarter. The percentage increase is primarily due to the decline in direct energy loan balances. Further, we are substantially complete with our spring redeterminations, which to date resulted in a 22% decline in customer borrowing bases.
Turning to capital deployment. We successfully completed the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process or CCAR and received no objection to our planned capital actions. As -- in last week, our Board of Directors approved the $0.065 dividend on common shares and $640 million share repurchase plan. We remain committed as a team to deploying our capital effectively through organic growth and strategic initiatives that increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses while returning an appropriate amount of capital generated to our shareholders.
In closing, our second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities and our continued commitment to our 3 primary initiatives, which are: growing and diversifying our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to our success, and we remain on track to deliver our performance targets.
With that, I'll turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the second quarter."
271409,367089830,1008196,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almo",2131,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 20%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of $303 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending and balances increased $162 million linked-quarter, reflecting a 49% seasonal increase in production. Indirect auto lending increased $93 million and production increased 4% during the quarter, as we continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network. Other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $87 million linked-quarter or 15%.
Turning to the credit card portfolio. Average balances increased $16 million from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 17.7%, an improvement of 20 basis points. Total home equity balances decreased $87 million from the previous quarter as the pace of runoff exceeded production. As Grayson mentioned, we continue to experience softer pipelines in the commercial space. As a result, total business lending average balances were relatively stable with the previous quarter. Average commercial loans grew $178 million linked-quarter, inclusive of a $64 million decline in average direct energy loans. The net increase in average commercial loans was driven by Corporate Banking as our specialized industry segments added new relationships within Technology & Defense and financial services, and commitments and line utilization were relatively flat with previous quarter.
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances decreased $253 million from the previous quarter. Deposit costs remain near historically low levels at 12 basis points, reflecting the strength of our deposit base. And total funding costs continue to remain low, totaling 29 basis points in the second quarter. With respect to deposits, loan growth expectation provided the opportunity to accelerate our planned reduction of certain deposits within our Wealth Management and corporate segments, which contributed to the overall decline in deposit balances. Within Wealth Management, certain trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, were moved into other fee income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the consumer segment increased $1.2 billion or 2% from the previous quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. Our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low -- loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%.
Let's see how this all impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $869 million, decreasing 2% from the first quarter, but up 4% compared to the prior year. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.15%. And as you recall, the first quarter benefited from items that were not expected to repeat, which partially contributed to the linked-quarter declines in net interest income and other financing income as well as the net interest margin.
Recent long-term debt issuances, lower loan fees and less favorable credit-related interest recoveries, along with reduced dividends from trading assets that benefited the first quarter were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter decrease. Now these were partially offset by higher loan balances.
Noninterest income growth was strong in the second quarter, reflecting our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify noninterest revenue. Total noninterest income increased 2% on an adjusted basis from the first quarter, driven by growth in service charges, mortgage income and card and ATM fees. Service charges increased 4% in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of 2% growth year-to-date in checking accounts again, highlighting the strength of our retail franchise. Mortgage income increased 21%, driven by seasonal increase in production. Of note, within total mortgage production, 75% related to purchase activity and 25% related to refinancing. Additionally, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis. As a result, we expect to purchase the rights to service approximately $40 million to $50 million of mortgage loans per month on a go-forward basis.
Card and ATM income increased 4% during the quarter, driven by 1% increase in active debit cards and an 8% increase in transaction volume. We had another good quarter in capital markets with increased fees from merger and acquisition advisory services. Linked-quarter results declined 7% relative to the prior quarter's strong results. The decline was primarily due to reductions in fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and syndicated loan transactions, which were especially strong in the first quarter.
Wealth Management income decreased 3%, primarily due to seasonal decreases in insurance income. This decrease was partially offset by increased investment management and trust fees. Importantly, despite our reduction in Wealth Management deposits, total assets under administration increased 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Noninterest income was also impacted by market value adjustments related to assets held for certain employee benefits, which increased $20 million compared to the first quarter. However, this is offset salaries and benefits with no impact to pretax income.
Bank-owned life insurance decreased this quarter, primarily due to $14 million in claims benefits and a gain from an exchange of policies recognized in the first quarter.
Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $889 million, representing a 5.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred $22 million of property-related expenses in connection with the consolidation of approximately 60 branches as well as other occupancy optimization initiatives. These branches are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Including these 60 branches, Regions has announced a consolidation of approximately 90 branches as part of the company's previously disclosed plans to consolidate 100 to 150 branches through 2018. And we continue to expect to be at the higher end of the range.
Total salaries and benefits increased $5 million from the first quarter, and as previously noted, includes $20 million in additional expense related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other noninterest income, as I've mentioned. In addition, severance-related expenses declined by $11 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of the market value adjustments and severance charges, total salaries and benefits would have declined compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date, staffing levels have declined 4%, serving to lower base salaries and fully offset the impact of the annual merit increase.
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million, primarily due to $3 million in legal and regulatory charges incurred during the second quarter related to the pending settlement of previously disclosed matters as well as the impact of a $7 million favorable legal settlement recognized in the first quarter.
FDIC insurance assessments decreased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a $6 million refund related to overpayments in prior periods. As previously disclosed, we expect FDIC insurance assessments to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis, associated with the FDIC surcharge, but we anticipate this will be implemented in the third quarter, resulting in a quarterly FDIC run rate in the $27 million to $30 million range.
Other expenses increased $25 million, including an $11 million increase to the company's reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $9 million of credit-related charges associated with other real estate and held-for-sale loans.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64% in the second quarter and 62.3% year-to-date. As Grayson mentioned, in this uncertain market environment, we are focused on what we can control. And to that end, disciplined expense management is paramount. Our plan to eliminate $300 million in core expenses through 2018 is well underway. We're also evaluating opportunities to pull forward some of the identified savings as well as challenging our team to thoughtfully identify additional expense eliminations beyond the $300 million previously announced.
Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $4 million to $72 million and represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses essentially matched charge-offs in the quarter, and our allowance for loan losses, as a percent of total loans, remained unchanged at 1.41%.
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 3% from the first quarter and troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs increased 4%. Total business services criticized loans increased 1%. These increases reflect global market uncertainty and the strength of the U.S. dollar, along with continued volatility in commodity prices. At quarter-end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans, or coverage ratio, was 112%. We continue to see credit improvement within the consumer portfolio as net charge-offs decreased 24% from the prior quarter. Additionally, consumer TDRs improved linked-quarter while total delinquencies remained relatively stable.
Within Business Services, we experienced $17 million worth of net charge-offs within the energy portfolio during the quarter. Approximately half were attributable to oil and gas and half were attributable to coal. While oil prices have recently traded around $50 per barrel and are showing signs of stabilization, uncertainty remains. Should prices fall and consistently trade in the $35 to $45 range, we expect additional losses between $50 million and $75 million. However, the time frame for these losses now extends through 2017 as we expect resolution will take longer for certain customers in the portfolio. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture continues to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. We also continue to monitor investor real estate in energy-related markets. We continue to believe our total allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in these portfolios. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large -- larger dollar commercial credits.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of $179 million of common stock and $79 million in dividends, completing our 2015 CCAR capital plan. As Grayson mentioned, we successfully completed our 2016 CCAR process and received no objection to our planned capital actions. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 quarterly dividend on common shares and the $640 million share repurchase plan. Now under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums.
Now let me provide you with an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. Given softer pipelines in the commercial space, we expect to track towards the lower end of that range.
Regarding deposits, softer loan growth expectations coupled with the strategic reductions of certain deposits within our Wealth Management corporate banking segments will result in total average deposits remaining relatively stable with fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged. Assuming no rate increases for the remainder of 2016, we expect to be at the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we continue to expect to grow adjusted noninterest income in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis. And given our year-to-date performance, we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is on track. And we continue to expect to achieve 35% to 45% in 2016. Therefore, total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015. We also expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 63% and adjusted positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. Full year net charge-offs should be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. And given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we continue to expect to be at the top end of that range.
So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and believe our results demonstrate that we are effectively executing our strategic plan in the context of a difficult operating environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

And you'll see, over quarters, the volatility they -- that can have, pluses and minuses. We expect that credit would fund in the third quarter, and -- but we believe it was important for us to continue to have an unfunded reserve for that today. From an OREO and held-for-sale standpoint, again, just a couple of credits. They happen to be large. And we had some write-downs that we believe needed to take place. So we had valuation adjustments in total of about $9 million. So you're spot on between the 2. That was about $20 million of charge that we had to take during the quarter."

So just wanted to see if -- as you think about where you're at today versus where you're at -- as you've been in the last downturn, what makes Regions different from just a risk profile [indiscernible] significant changes you've been able to address that should at least make investors comfortable with tangible book value?"

I mean so we've -- over the past 6 years, we've made a lot of changes in people and process. Content of our whole balance sheet has changed dramatically. The most obvious one is the decline in investor real estate, which represented almost 30% of our loans portfolio at one time. Today, it's about, I'd say, call it, 9% -- right at 9%. The credit discipline that we have with regards to how we approach business is very different. And we feel good. We got our -- we have our hands around our loan portfolio. Energy, energy has been a challenge for our industry and those that participate in it. But our concentration risk management program that we have in place has reduced the impact -- the negative impact we would otherwise have had. Being the largest bank headquartered in the Gulf States, we have now about 3% of our loan portfolio in energy. And we've talked about the reserves -- the 9.4% reserves. So we believe we have that covered. There is some volatility and uncertainty there. We feel like we're on top of that. As we think about our commitment to continue to grow our cash flow, our PPNR, look at the investments that we've made over time, those investments are paying off as we continue to grow and diversify our revenue stream. And we've had a fairly consistent margin, if you look at that. And then I'll wrap up with expense management. We have a $300 million target out there. We're -- we've said we'd take 35% to 45% of that in the first year. We're on track with where we want to be. And I gave you guidance as to where we thought we would finish the year. So it's a very different Regions and a very different approach to business and the stability of growth in tangible book value that we've been leveraging our earnings well and returning mid-90% of our capital back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend, around 30% of that earnings and 60-plus percent and in terms of share buybacks. So we think we're deploying our capital effectively. So good business, good markets, good customers and executing against the strategic plan that we laid out in October for our board and at Investor Day."

And so I wouldn't say it's limited to one particular industry. It seems to be more broad-based in that. But if you look at credit quality, commercial is still very good. We've had a really good experience now for several quarters in a row. We still expect it to be good, but it's modestly soft, modestly weaker than what we saw a quarter ago. And at the same time, we're just not seeing the new and renewed production that we were seeing this time last year."

And I would expect you can have 4 to 6 more points of compression to the remainder of the year. But as we think about growing NII, we do it from a couple of different spots. One, growing earning assets, which is really on the funding side, the deposit side, and then putting those -- that growth in good solid loan growth, where we can get compensated for the risks that we take, where we can get compensated for having a full customer relationship versus just renting out the balance sheet from a credit-only standpoint. It's very hard to make money if you're just making loans-only. So we're challenging our teams where we have a relationship that's a credit-only relationship to figure out how we recycle that capital into a more fulsome relationship with the customer. So just because we don't have the loan growth doesn't mean we can't continue to grow NII if we execute that program appropriately. So that's kind of how we think about NII going forward."

But if you're 2.25% over, you're working against yourself. That portfolio yielding -- yields today about 3.5%. And so as we think about how to combat some of this, one is to get deeper relationship. We're not having to look just at spread because the spread is only a component part of the income we get from the customer base. It's the other NIR sources that help round it out. So if, in fact, we had a lower-spread asset with a full relationship, we can deal with that. It's having a low spread without the relationship that's a problem. So I think that also, how to combat this would be the consumer growth. We grew consumer loans about $300 million. We've had nice production in consumer, where we're getting paid for that risk, and that's helping to combat the downward pressure on loan yields. So our loan yields from the first quarter were only down 2 basis points. Part of that's the mix shift and the remixing of business that we're trying to make in our total balance sheet to be more profitable and to get better return to our shareholders."

For us, we want to make sure we optimize our capital structure in terms of the nature of the components of preferred stock and common stock and the like to make sure that that's optimized. And over time, we'll do that to reduce our cost of equity. But I think working on the stresses inherent in the balance sheet, which we have done, and you've seen that come down in places like commercial real estate, losses came down quite dramatically but still high.

We do think that the alternative channels, ATM, call center, mobile, online, all of those other channels provide us an opportunity to provide a strong connectivity to the customer.

Second quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2006 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic priorities. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic background.
For the second quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $259 million and earnings per share of $0.20. We continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth. We expanded our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth relationships. Our approach to relationship banking and customer service excellence is instrumental to our success, and we are always pleased to receive external recognition of these efforts. In that regard, the Reputation Institute and the American Banker Magazine recently ranked Regions as the most reputable U.S. bank overall and for the second consecutive year the most reputable among customers. We are honored to again receive this top ranking as it recognized the efforts of all Regions' associates in identifying and meeting the needs of our customers and communities we serve.
Another outstanding recognition came from Temkin Group, which ranked Regions among the top 10% of companies they rated in 2016 as we ranked second in the nation for online experience.
Looking further at our results, we achieved total average loan growth of 4% compared to the prior year. Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains a bright spot. To that end, consumer loans increased 5% year-over-year with loan balances up in every asset category. And our consumer credit metrics continue to improve. Consumer net charge-offs decreased 5% from the second quarter last year. Nonaccrual consumer loans decreased 16%. Delinquencies decreased 5%, and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4%. Active credit cards increased 12% year-over-year while active debit cards increased 4%. Total transactions on cards increased 6% and total spend is up 5%. Further, average consumer deposits were up 3% year-over-year, including savings deposits were up 9%.
Turning to business lending. Average loans increased 3% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter, we are experiencing some softness in our commercial lending pipelines, still strong, but soft. In some areas, customer sentiment continues to reflect less optimism and more uncertainty in the economy. And we have yet to see small business owners really return to the market with confidence to invest and expand.
We are also exercising caution and discipline as we approach internal concentration risk lending limits with certain segments and certain geographies. And as we highlighted recently at Investor Day, we continued to strengthen our loan portfolio and our focus on migrating credit-only relationships, recycling that capital into more profitable and deeper relationships that result in a better portfolio overall. As a result, and as previously disclosed, we expect to track towards lower end of our 3% to 5% average loan growth for 2016.
Despite softer business loan demand, total adjusted revenue increased 4% over the second quarter '15, reflecting the effective execution of our strategic plan to grow and diversify our revenue. Our investments are clearly paying off as capital markets increased 41% and Wealth Management increased 6% on a year-over-year basis.
With respect to market conditions, the global and macroeconomic environment does remain challenging. As such, it's critical in this operating environment that we focus on what we can control. To that end, we remain committed and focused on disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. For the first 6 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.3%, and we have generated 4% positive operating leverage on adjusted basis.
With respect to energy lending, while oil prices have improved, low prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. While on a point-to-point basis, our direct energy loans have declined $324 million or 12% for the first quarter and currently stand at $2.4 billion or 2.9% of total loans.
Additionally, we continue to maintain appropriate energy reserves, which now stand at 9.4% of our direct energy exposure, up from 8% last quarter. The percentage increase is primarily due to the decline in direct energy loan balances. Further, we are substantially complete with our spring redeterminations, which to date resulted in a 22% decline in customer borrowing bases.
Turning to capital deployment. We successfully completed the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process or CCAR and received no objection to our planned capital actions. As -- in last week, our Board of Directors approved the $0.065 dividend on common shares and $640 million share repurchase plan. We remain committed as a team to deploying our capital effectively through organic growth and strategic initiatives that increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses while returning an appropriate amount of capital generated to our shareholders.
In closing, our second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities and our continued commitment to our 3 primary initiatives, which are: growing and diversifying our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to our success, and we remain on track to deliver our performance targets.
With that, I'll turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the second quarter."
271409,367089830,1008819,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almo",2131,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer Lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 20%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of $303 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending and balances increased $162 million linked-quarter, reflecting a 49% seasonal increase in production. Indirect auto lending increased $93 million and production increased 4% during the quarter, as we continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network. Other indirect lending, which includes point-of-sale initiatives, increased $87 million linked-quarter or 15%.
Turning to the credit card portfolio. Average balances increased $16 million from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 17.7%, an improvement of 20 basis points. Total home equity balances decreased $87 million from the previous quarter as the pace of runoff exceeded production. As Grayson mentioned, we continue to experience softer pipelines in the commercial space. As a result, total business lending average balances were relatively stable with the previous quarter. Average commercial loans grew $178 million linked-quarter, inclusive of a $64 million decline in average direct energy loans. The net increase in average commercial loans was driven by Corporate Banking as our specialized industry segments added new relationships within Technology & Defense and financial services, and commitments and line utilization were relatively flat with previous quarter.
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances decreased $253 million from the previous quarter. Deposit costs remain near historically low levels at 12 basis points, reflecting the strength of our deposit base. And total funding costs continue to remain low, totaling 29 basis points in the second quarter. With respect to deposits, loan growth expectation provided the opportunity to accelerate our planned reduction of certain deposits within our Wealth Management and corporate segments, which contributed to the overall decline in deposit balances. Within Wealth Management, certain trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, were moved into other fee income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the consumer segment increased $1.2 billion or 2% from the previous quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. Our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low -- loan-to-deposit ratio of 84%.
Let's see how this all impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $869 million, decreasing 2% from the first quarter, but up 4% compared to the prior year. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.15%. And as you recall, the first quarter benefited from items that were not expected to repeat, which partially contributed to the linked-quarter declines in net interest income and other financing income as well as the net interest margin.
Recent long-term debt issuances, lower loan fees and less favorable credit-related interest recoveries, along with reduced dividends from trading assets that benefited the first quarter were the primary drivers behind the linked-quarter decrease. Now these were partially offset by higher loan balances.
Noninterest income growth was strong in the second quarter, reflecting our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify noninterest revenue. Total noninterest income increased 2% on an adjusted basis from the first quarter, driven by growth in service charges, mortgage income and card and ATM fees. Service charges increased 4% in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of 2% growth year-to-date in checking accounts again, highlighting the strength of our retail franchise. Mortgage income increased 21%, driven by seasonal increase in production. Of note, within total mortgage production, 75% related to purchase activity and 25% related to refinancing. Additionally, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis. As a result, we expect to purchase the rights to service approximately $40 million to $50 million of mortgage loans per month on a go-forward basis.
Card and ATM income increased 4% during the quarter, driven by 1% increase in active debit cards and an 8% increase in transaction volume. We had another good quarter in capital markets with increased fees from merger and acquisition advisory services. Linked-quarter results declined 7% relative to the prior quarter's strong results. The decline was primarily due to reductions in fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and syndicated loan transactions, which were especially strong in the first quarter.
Wealth Management income decreased 3%, primarily due to seasonal decreases in insurance income. This decrease was partially offset by increased investment management and trust fees. Importantly, despite our reduction in Wealth Management deposits, total assets under administration increased 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Noninterest income was also impacted by market value adjustments related to assets held for certain employee benefits, which increased $20 million compared to the first quarter. However, this is offset salaries and benefits with no impact to pretax income.
Bank-owned life insurance decreased this quarter, primarily due to $14 million in claims benefits and a gain from an exchange of policies recognized in the first quarter.
Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $889 million, representing a 5.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred $22 million of property-related expenses in connection with the consolidation of approximately 60 branches as well as other occupancy optimization initiatives. These branches are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Including these 60 branches, Regions has announced a consolidation of approximately 90 branches as part of the company's previously disclosed plans to consolidate 100 to 150 branches through 2018. And we continue to expect to be at the higher end of the range.
Total salaries and benefits increased $5 million from the first quarter, and as previously noted, includes $20 million in additional expense related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other noninterest income, as I've mentioned. In addition, severance-related expenses declined by $11 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of the market value adjustments and severance charges, total salaries and benefits would have declined compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date, staffing levels have declined 4%, serving to lower base salaries and fully offset the impact of the annual merit increase.
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million, primarily due to $3 million in legal and regulatory charges incurred during the second quarter related to the pending settlement of previously disclosed matters as well as the impact of a $7 million favorable legal settlement recognized in the first quarter.
FDIC insurance assessments decreased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a $6 million refund related to overpayments in prior periods. As previously disclosed, we expect FDIC insurance assessments to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis, associated with the FDIC surcharge, but we anticipate this will be implemented in the third quarter, resulting in a quarterly FDIC run rate in the $27 million to $30 million range.
Other expenses increased $25 million, including an $11 million increase to the company's reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $9 million of credit-related charges associated with other real estate and held-for-sale loans.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64% in the second quarter and 62.3% year-to-date. As Grayson mentioned, in this uncertain market environment, we are focused on what we can control. And to that end, disciplined expense management is paramount. Our plan to eliminate $300 million in core expenses through 2018 is well underway. We're also evaluating opportunities to pull forward some of the identified savings as well as challenging our team to thoughtfully identify additional expense eliminations beyond the $300 million previously announced.
Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $4 million to $72 million and represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses essentially matched charge-offs in the quarter, and our allowance for loan losses, as a percent of total loans, remained unchanged at 1.41%.
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 3% from the first quarter and troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs increased 4%. Total business services criticized loans increased 1%. These increases reflect global market uncertainty and the strength of the U.S. dollar, along with continued volatility in commodity prices. At quarter-end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans, or coverage ratio, was 112%. We continue to see credit improvement within the consumer portfolio as net charge-offs decreased 24% from the prior quarter. Additionally, consumer TDRs improved linked-quarter while total delinquencies remained relatively stable.
Within Business Services, we experienced $17 million worth of net charge-offs within the energy portfolio during the quarter. Approximately half were attributable to oil and gas and half were attributable to coal. While oil prices have recently traded around $50 per barrel and are showing signs of stabilization, uncertainty remains. Should prices fall and consistently trade in the $35 to $45 range, we expect additional losses between $50 million and $75 million. However, the time frame for these losses now extends through 2017 as we expect resolution will take longer for certain customers in the portfolio. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture continues to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. We also continue to monitor investor real estate in energy-related markets. We continue to believe our total allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in these portfolios. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large -- larger dollar commercial credits.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of $179 million of common stock and $79 million in dividends, completing our 2015 CCAR capital plan. As Grayson mentioned, we successfully completed our 2016 CCAR process and received no objection to our planned capital actions. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 quarterly dividend on common shares and the $640 million share repurchase plan. Now under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums.
Now let me provide you with an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. Given softer pipelines in the commercial space, we expect to track towards the lower end of that range.
Regarding deposits, softer loan growth expectations coupled with the strategic reductions of certain deposits within our Wealth Management corporate banking segments will result in total average deposits remaining relatively stable with fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged. Assuming no rate increases for the remainder of 2016, we expect to be at the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we continue to expect to grow adjusted noninterest income in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis. And given our year-to-date performance, we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is on track. And we continue to expect to achieve 35% to 45% in 2016. Therefore, total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015. We also expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 63% and adjusted positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. Full year net charge-offs should be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. And given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we continue to expect to be at the top end of that range.
So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and believe our results demonstrate that we are effectively executing our strategic plan in the context of a difficult operating environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

And you'll see, over quarters, the volatility they -- that can have, pluses and minuses. We expect that credit would fund in the third quarter, and -- but we believe it was important for us to continue to have an unfunded reserve for that today. From an OREO and held-for-sale standpoint, again, just a couple of credits. They happen to be large. And we had some write-downs that we believe needed to take place. So we had valuation adjustments in total of about $9 million. So you're spot on between the 2. That was about $20 million of charge that we had to take during the quarter."

As you're looking at creating shareholder value, one of the things is probably -- what you've been able to derisk because just getting credit from the tangible book value growth would be an upward momentum for the overall valuation. So just wanted to see if -- as you think about where you're at today versus where you're at -- as you've been in the last downturn, what makes Regions different from just a risk profile [indiscernible] significant changes you've been able to address that should at least make investors comfortable with tangible book value?"

I mean so we've -- over the past 6 years, we've made a lot of changes in people and process. Content of our whole balance sheet has changed dramatically. The most obvious one is the decline in investor real estate, which represented almost 30% of our loans portfolio at one time. Today, it's about, I'd say, call it, 9% -- right at 9%. The credit discipline that we have with regards to how we approach business is very different. And we feel good. We got our -- we have our hands around our loan portfolio. Energy, energy has been a challenge for our industry and those that participate in it. But our concentration risk management program that we have in place has reduced the impact -- the negative impact we would otherwise have had. Being the largest bank headquartered in the Gulf States, we have now about 3% of our loan portfolio in energy. And we've talked about the reserves -- the 9.4% reserves. So we believe we have that covered. There is some volatility and uncertainty there. We feel like we're on top of that. As we think about our commitment to continue to grow our cash flow, our PPNR, look at the investments that we've made over time, those investments are paying off as we continue to grow and diversify our revenue stream. And we've had a fairly consistent margin, if you look at that. And then I'll wrap up with expense management. We have a $300 million target out there. We're -- we've said we'd take 35% to 45% of that in the first year. We're on track with where we want to be. And I gave you guidance as to where we thought we would finish the year. So it's a very different Regions and a very different approach to business and the stability of growth in tangible book value that we've been leveraging our earnings well and returning mid-90% of our capital back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend, around 30% of that earnings and 60-plus percent and in terms of share buybacks. So we think we're deploying our capital effectively. So good business, good markets, good customers and executing against the strategic plan that we laid out in October for our board and at Investor Day."

And I would expect you can have 4 to 6 more points of compression to the remainder of the year. But as we think about growing NII, we do it from a couple of different spots. One, growing earning assets, which is really on the funding side, the deposit side, and then putting those -- that growth in good solid loan growth, where we can get compensated for the risks that we take, where we can get compensated for having a full customer relationship versus just renting out the balance sheet from a credit-only standpoint. It's very hard to make money if you're just making loans-only. So we're challenging our teams where we have a relationship that's a credit-only relationship to figure out how we recycle that capital into a more fulsome relationship with the customer. So just because we don't have the loan growth doesn't mean we can't continue to grow NII if we execute that program appropriately. So that's kind of how we think about NII going forward."

It takes them longer to restructure and get back on their feet, so again, the extended tail on the oilfield services. And as we think of our provision, roughly 2/3 of our provision right now is established against the oilfield services subsector in our book."

And clearly, part of the weakness we're seeing is just general market demand for credit. And if you look at the top of company and domestic U.S. numbers, the level of fixed capital spending by wholesale customers continues to be below historical proportions. And so we're seeing that in demand for credit. But at the same time, you'll also hear us talking about making sure that we've got full relationships and we're getting paid a reasonable return for providing banking services to our clients. And so we need a full relationship to do that. The return on a credit-only relationship is just not sufficient. But we also have been very disciplined in making sure that our -- that we have diversity in our balance sheet, and so there's certain asset categories that our risk appetite is fulfilled on. And so we've been more judicious about not adding more of that product type to our balance sheet, and we're absolutely committed to staying diversified. I think if you look at it today, we would say it's about half and half. About half of it's market, and about half of it is disciplines that we are invoking. I'd also remind you that when you look at our loan growth for this quarter, keep in mind the reduction in energy loans that we've achieved over the past quarter then has been a -- there's a story there that, without that reduction in energy, growth in our wholesale book would have been much stronger."

But if you're 2.25% over, you're working against yourself. That portfolio yielding -- yields today about 3.5%. And so as we think about how to combat some of this, one is to get deeper relationship. We're not having to look just at spread because the spread is only a component part of the income we get from the customer base. It's the other NIR sources that help round it out. So if, in fact, we had a lower-spread asset with a full relationship, we can deal with that. It's having a low spread without the relationship that's a problem. So I think that also, how to combat this would be the consumer growth. We grew consumer loans about $300 million. We've had nice production in consumer, where we're getting paid for that risk, and that's helping to combat the downward pressure on loan yields. So our loan yields from the first quarter were only down 2 basis points. Part of that's the mix shift and the remixing of business that we're trying to make in our total balance sheet to be more profitable and to get better return to our shareholders."

We do think that the alternative channels, ATM, call center, mobile, online, all of those other channels provide us an opportunity to provide a strong connectivity to the customer. And while we've seen branches losing traffic in the sort of 3% to 5% a year range, we've seen tremendous growth in the online and mobile channel.

Now we are pleased with our continued progress on",839,"Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing our strategic plan. Now we are pleased with our continued progress on fundamentals despite a challenging operating environment. David's going to take you through the details shortly, but let me just provide a few highlights. For the quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $304 million and earnings per share of $0.24. There are a number of items that impacted the quarter, which we will address as we review the results. But all in all, a good quarter, a solid quarter for Regions. We delivered solid revenue growth by increasing deposits and noninterest income. Total adjusted revenue increased 5% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by a strong adjusted noninterest growth of 12%, clear evidence that our investments are paying off. Notably, capital markets and Wealth Management both produced record quarters. As part of our continuing efforts to grow and diversify our revenue, we recently announced the acquisition of a low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management business of First Sterling Financial. This acquisition complements our existing low income housing tax credit origination business and further expands our capital market capabilities and our ability to serve our customers. 
With respect to market conditions, the global macro economic environment continued to remain somewhat challenging. As such, it's critical that we focus on things that are within our power to control. And to that end, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next 3 years is clearly underway. However, based on current expectations for a continued low-rate, low-growth environment, we have determined that additional expense eliminations are necessary to operate in this environment, to go beyond the $300 million amount. To that end, we have targeted an additional $100 million, which we expect to achieve by 2019. In total, this $400 million represents 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. 
Turning to asset quality for just a moment. We continue to see some stress in certain segments, given where we are in the cycle, but we view our overall asset quality as stable today. In addition, the continued stabilization of oil prices has positively impacted certain credit metrics. 
With regards to loans, we continue to exercise caution and remain focused on prudent and quality loan growth. Regarding business lending, average loans are down modestly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to experience muted customer demand and heavy competition in the business segment, particularly in the middle market commercial and small-business sectors. We're also seeing some large corporate customers accessing the capital markets and are using these proceeds to pay down bank debt. 
In addition, we experienced 100 basis points decline in line utilization of commercial customers during the quarter. Corporate customers remain focused on liquidity, which is evidenced by a 2% increase in average corporate bank segment deposits. 
Excluding the impact of public funds, average deposits in the corporate bank at Regions are up 5%. In addition, direct energy loans continue to pay down or pay off. And over the past 2 quarters, we have seen a favorable decline of approximately $500 million on a point-to-point basis and approximately $300 million on a linked-quarter basis. It's important to point out that while reduced demand is impacting industry, we are deliberately limiting production in certain areas. For example, investor real estate, in particular, is an area where we remain guarded. We're also limiting exposure specifically to multifamily and medical office buildings. Year-to-date, in these outstanding balances in these portfolios have declined approximately $300 million combined on a point-to-point basis. 
Importantly, we continue to focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns within our business, portfolios and relationships. And we believe this approach will lead to quality loan growth in the future. 
Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains strong, and we continue to see solid demand and steady growth in almost all of our consumer loan categories. 
With respect to capital, we're encouraged by recent regulatory directions and comments and the subsequent notice of proposed rule-making, which we believe will be constructed for Regions. That said, our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged. First and foremost, we're focused on prudent organic growth. We will also continue to evaluate strategic alternatives that increase revenue or reduce operating expenses, while returning an appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders.  Year-to-date, we have returned approximately 9.5% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, our third quarter results reflect the continued execution of our plans and our commitment to our 3 primary strategic initiatives which are: one, grow and diversify revenue streams; two is to practice disciplined expense management; and three, to effectively deploy capital. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave who will cover the details for the third quarter. Dave?"
271409,402034266,1056313,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to each of them as we move to the results. So let's get started with the balance sheet and look at average loans. Average loan balances tot",2138,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to each of them as we move to the results. 
So let's get started with the balance sheet and look at average loans. Average loan balances totaled $81 billion in the third quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer lending experienced another solid quarter of growth as average consumer loan balances increased $302 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending, and balances increased $259 million linked-quarter, reflecting another seasonally strong quarter of production. 
We continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $93 million linked-quarter or 14%. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $44 million or 4%, as penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 18.2%, an improvement of 50 basis points. 
Now turning to the indirect auto portfolio. Average balances decreased $36 million during the quarter. We continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network while exiting certain smaller dealers. In addition, we remain focused on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns in this portfolio. And average home equity balances decreased $94 million as the pace of runoff exceeded production. 
Now turning to the business services portfolio. As Grayson mentioned, the decrease in average business services loans during the quarter was driven by an approximate $300 million decline in average direct energy loans. In addition, loan growth was impacted by continued softness in demand for middle-market commercial and small-business loans. Furthermore, we are remaining disciplined with our management of concentration risk limits and a continued focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. More specifically, we are limiting our exposure to multifamily and medical office buildings. And as a result, total business lending average balances decreased $979 million or 2% during the quarter. Despite this decline, there are areas within Business Services experiencing growth such as technology and defense and asset-based lending. And we continue -- expect to continue to leverage our go-to-market strategy of local bankers working with industry and product specialists to deliver the entire bank to our customers to meet their particular needs. 
Related, we're also making progress with our focus on profitability and are using capital more effectively. Through July, we have achieved greater relevance in a number of large corporate relationships and improved our risk-adjusted returns on these loans by over 200 basis points. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances increased $439 million from the previous quarter, including $330 million of growth in average low-cost deposits. Deposit costs remained near historically low levels at 12 basis points, and total funding costs remain low, totaling 30 basis points for the quarter. Total average deposits in the consumer segment were up $483 million or 1% in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. As previously noted, average corporate segment deposits increased $675 million or 2% during the quarter as corporate customers remained focused on liquidity. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment decreased $637 million or 6% during the quarter as certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, continue to shift down the deposits and into other fee-income-producing customer investments. 
So let's see how all of this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income, on a fully taxable basis, was $856 million, a decrease of $13 million or 1% from the second quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.06%. Net interest income and other financing income was negatively impacted by a $7 million leverage lease residual value adjustment, and this adjustment reduced net interest margin by 3 basis points. In addition, historically low rates experienced in the second and third quarters of 2016 caused prepayments in our mortgage-backed securities book to increase, resulting in higher premium amortization of approximately $13 million during the quarter. However, given the recent moves to modestly higher long-term rates, we expect $4 million to $6 million of improvement in premium amortization during the fourth quarter. And lastly, lower average loan balances further reduced net interest income and other financing income in the quarter. These reductions were partially offset by higher short-term rates, 1 additional day in the quarter and our debt deleveraging that we executed this quarter. So if you exclude the impact of the $7 million leveraged lease residual value adjustment and the expected $4 million premium amortization improvement, net interest income and other financing income for the third quarter would have been approximately $867 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis and a margin of 3.09%. And we believe the fourth quarter will approximate these amounts. 
Noninterest income increased 14% in the quarter and included the impact of $47 million of insurance proceeds associated with the previously disclosed settlement related to FHA insured mortgage loans. Adjusted noninterest income growth was particularly strong in the third quarter and reflected our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify revenue. Almost every noninterest revenue category increased, driven by record capital markets and Wealth Management income and growth in card and ATM fees, resulting in a 5% increase compared to the second quarter. 
Capital markets fee income grew $4 million or 11% during the quarter, driven primarily by the Mergers and Acquisition Advisory Services Group. Card and ATM income increased $6 million or 6% during the quarter driven by an increase in the number of active cards and spend volume. Wealth Management income increased $4 million or 4% during the quarter, driven by increased investment management and trustees as assets under administration increased 5% from $88.1 billion to $92.6 billion. Mortgage income was stable during the quarter as increased gains from loan sales were offset by declines in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 67% was related to purchase activity and 33% was related to refinancing. 
Also during the quarter, we completed a bulk purchase for the rights to service approximately $2.8 billion of mortgage loans. And year-to-date, we purchased the rights to service approximately $6 billion of mortgage loans, and our mortgage portfolio service for others has grown from approximately $26 billion to $30 billion over the past year. We still have additional capacity, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our servicing portfolio. 
Other noninterest income includes the recovery of $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. We also recognized an $8 million leveraged lease termination gain, which was substantially offset by a related increase in income taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decline in revenue from market value adjustments related to employee benefit assets, which were offset in salaries in benefit expense and resulted in no impact to pretax income. 
As it relates to future noninterest income growth, Regions is one of the nation's largest participants in affordable housing finance through the low income housing tax credits program, and we're excited about the opportunity to enhance our capabilities through the recently announced acquisition of the low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management businesses of First Sterling. 
So let's move on to expenses. Total noninterest expenses increased 2% during the quarter and included a $14 million charge for the early extinguishment of parent company debt and a $5 million charge associated with branch closures we announced last quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $912 million, representing a 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. Total salaries and benefits increased $6 million from the second quarter, primarily due to 1 additional weekday, which accounts for approximately $5 million. Production-based incentives also increased during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in expenses related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which were offset in other noninterest income that I mentioned. In addition, year-to-date staffing levels have declined 5% or approximately 1,200 positions as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Looking at the fourth quarter and excluding any impact from market value adjustments, we expect salaries and benefits to decline as a result of 1 less weekday in the quarter and the impact of continuing expense management. 
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million during the quarter, primarily due to increases in legal reserves. As expected, FDIC insurance assessments increased $12 million in the third quarter, including a $5 million related to the implementation of the FDIC assessment surcharge. In addition, the second quarter assessment benefited from a $6 million refund related to prior period overpayments. The company also incurred $8 million related to the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $11 million of expense related to Visa Class B shares sold in a prior year. The Visa class B shares have restrictions tied to the finalization of certain covered litigation. The current-quarter charge primarily relates to a class-action settlement that was overturned on appeal, and we would not expect this level of expense to repeat. 
For the first 9 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.3%, and we have generated 3% positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis. As Grayson mentioned, we have targeted an additional $100 million in expense eliminations beyond our original announcement, bringing the total target to $400 million or 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. And we will continue to identify opportunities to pull those savings forward whenever possible. 
Let's move on to asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $54 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million from the second quarter and represents -- represented 26 basis points of average loans. Charge-offs related to our energy portfolio totaled $6 million in the quarter. The provision for loan losses was $25 million less than net charge-offs in the quarter. And our allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, decreased 2 basis points to 1.39%. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7.9% in the third quarter compared to 9.4% in the second quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in our overall energy book. 
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased to 1.33% of loans outstanding. There were 5 energy and energy-related loans which primarily drove the increase in nonaccrual loans. However, the increased provision associated with these loans was more than offset by the credit quality improvement in the balance of the energy portfolio driven by continued energy price stabilization as well as declines in loans outstanding. 
Troubled debt restructured loans and total delinquencies were relatively flat while total business service criticized loans increased 2%. The increase in criticized loans was driven by a small number of multifamily construction and transportation loans that were downgraded from past to special mention. While oil prices are continuing to stabilize, uncertainty remains. We expect cumulative losses for all of 2016 and 2017 to range between $50 million and $75 million. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. Through the first 9 months of 2016, we've incurred $23 million of charge-offs related to our energy portfolio. We are encouraged by the performance of our energy segment to date. However, we will continue to monitor and manage it closely. And given where we are in the credit cycle and considering fluctuation in commodity prices, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits. 
Let's talk about capital and liquidity. In the Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.9% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11%. In addition, our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. 
Now in terms of expectations for the remainder of 2016, we expect both average loans and average deposits to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter 2015. Our expectations for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged with full year growth of between the 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we now expect to grow full year adjusted noninterest income by more than 6%. Total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015, and we expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 63%, with a positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. And we continue to expect full year net charge-offs to be in that 25 to 35 basis point range. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion."

I mean, John, if you look at our reported earnings for the third quarter, clearly, consumer was very strong quarter. We were very encouraged by what we saw in the consumer, not only from loan growth standpoint, but from asset quality perspective. It continues to be very good and very stable. And we think while there's some seasonality in consumer lending, in particular around mortgage lending, we do anticipate that, that positive momentum carries forward. On the commercial side, especially in the small to medium-sized enterprises, we get very good production in the third quarter, but we also had an abnormally high level of payoffs and pay downs, and in particular around reductions in outstandings on commercial lines of credit. When you look at our thoughts for fourth quarter, we think production bodes well, but we do anticipate stability in the fourth quarter. I would just ask John Turner, who heads up that group for us, to add a little bit more color. I think this is an important question."

We said, as we think about a strategy, that we're under penetrated in certain markets, businesses and portfolios. We have, we think too many single service, kind of credit-only relationships.

We have, we think too many single service, kind of credit-only relationships. We've been good about clients activity, but not as focused on returns. And so as we think about our businesses and our desire to create a better mix of revenue, we've talked about real estate and our desire to manage that carefully given where we are in the cycle. Then our larger credit exposures, our corporate banking business, again we want to be thoughtful. That business has been growing over the last few years, but it grows with large exposures. And so we're mindful of the tall tree risk and mindful of the returns that we're getting in that business. And so a lot of what we've been doing there over the last 9 months is reallocating capital within that portfolio to relationships that are going to generate higher risk-adjusted returns. And we're beginning to see meaningful impact as a result of that. And I think it's also, as you can see, helping grow noninterest revenue, which is up almost 20% year-over-year. And then finally, within middle market and small business, it's really important, we think, that again we build those relationship out broadly. We don't chase opportunities. While Grayson said production was good, we have an opportunity to generate almost, again, half as much credit as we did, but it wasn't priced appropriately or the structures we didn't think were consistent with our risk appetite. So we have some levers to pull if we felt like that we needed to do that. But we believe a disciplined approach to building long-term, prudent, sustainable relationships that are profitable to the company, that generate value for our customers and for our shareholders is appropriate. And so we'll see. Stabilization, we think, in the fourth quarter. And then we believe kind of modest growth, I think we've indicated, David, in 2017."

Having a fair dividend to our shareholders is important. And then when we have access capital that we're generating, having an appropriate return in the form of a share buyback is in order. So I think, given all of that, it gives us an ability to think about capital targets relative to the risk that we have in our balance sheet. We've leverage -- we've mentioned that based on today's risk that we have that, that Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the 9.5% is where we would target over time and we're at approximately 11%.

It's trying to get the relationship return up, which can include credit, but it's going to include all the other products and services that we offer that customer. So we certainly are looking at things that have a credit-only relationship, that have a suboptimal return for us. And those are the ones we want to try and get the relationship, get our pricing through, get our returns better or recycling and leveraging that capital into another option or another alternative.

Just to underscore the work that's being done, talk about our corporate banking portfolio, particularly Shared National Credit book, and our desire to improve returns in that business. We actually exited almost $2 billion worth of credit in the first 9 months of the year. We reallocated that capital back into new relationships and existing relationships. And in doing that, we increase the revenue per relationship over 50% and the risk-adjusted returns in the business by almost 250 basis points.

The other challenge that you have when you derisk a book, and by derisking, you sell a lot of assets, is you don't enjoy the recovery stream after.

And so our focus on organic growth, our focus on improving the fundamentals of our company and our focus on bolt-on acquisitions that, while they don't consume a lot of capital, they also don't add a lot of risk to our company, that it's the integration, the synergies that we create, we got the ability to do that. We're pretty good at it. We think we can continue to do that. Hopefully, over time, we can even increase the pace of this kind of activity, but it doesn't -- it's a very manageable risk profile when we execute it this way.

Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing our strategic plan. Now we are pleased with our continued progress on fundamentals despite a challenging operating environment. David's going to take you through the details shortly, but let me just provide a few highlights. For the quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $304 million and earnings per share of $0.24. There are a number of items that impacted the quarter, which we will address as we review the results, but all in all a good quarter, a solid quarter for Regions. 
We delivered solid revenue growth by increasing deposits and noninterest income. Total adjusted revenue increased 5% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by a strong adjusted noninterest growth of 12%, clear evidence that our investments are paying off. 
Notably, capital markets and wealth management both produced record quarters. As part of our continuing efforts to grow and diversify our revenue, we recently announced the acquisition of a low-income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management business of First Sterling Financial. This acquisition complements our existing low-income housing tax credit origination business and further expands our capital market capabilities and our ability to serve our customers. 
With respect to market conditions, the global macroeconomic environment continued to remain somewhat challenging. As such, it's critical that we focus on things that are within our power to control. And to that end, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next 3 years is clearly underway. However, based on current expectations for a continued low-rate, low-growth environment, we have determined that additional expense eliminations are necessary to operate in this environment, to go beyond the $300 million amount. To that end, we have targeted additional $100 million, which we expect to achieve by 2019. In total, this $400 million represents 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. 
Turning to asset quality for just a moment. We continue to see some stress in certain segments, given where we are in the cycle, but we view our overall asset quality as stable today. In addition, the continued stabilization of oil prices has positively impacted certain credit metrics. 
With regards to loans, we continue to exercise caution and remain focused on prudent and quality loan growth. Regarding business lending, average loans are down modestly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to experience muted customer demand and heavy competition in the business segment, particularly in the middle market commercial and small-business sectors. We're also seeing some large corporate customers accessing the capital markets and are using these proceeds to pay down bank debt. 
In addition, we experienced 100 basis points decline in line utilization of commercial customers during the quarter. Corporate customers remain focused on liquidity, which is evidenced by a 2% increase in average corporate bank segment deposits. 
And excluding the impact of public funds, average deposits in the corporate bank at Regions are up 5%. In addition, direct energy loans continue to pay down or pay off. And over the past 2 quarters, we have seen a favorable decline of approximately $500 million on a point-to-point basis and approximately $300 million on a linked-quarter basis. It's important to point out that while reduced demand is impacting industry, we are deliberately limiting production in certain areas. For example, investor real estate, in particular, is an area where we remain guarded. We're also limiting exposure specifically to multifamily and medical office buildings. Year-to-date, in these outstanding balances in these portfolios have declined approximately $300 million combined on a point-to-point basis. 
Importantly, we continue to focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns within our business, portfolios and relationships. And we believe this approach will lead to quality loan growth in the future. Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains strong, and we continue to see solid demand and steady growth in almost all of our consumer loan categories. 
With respect to capital, we're encouraged by recent regulatory directions and comments and the subsequent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which we believe will be constructed for Regions. That said, our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged. First and foremost, we're focused on prudent organic growth. We will also continue to evaluate strategic alternatives that increase revenue or reduce operating expenses, while returning an appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately 99% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, our third quarter results reflect the continued execution of our plans and our commitment to our 3 primary strategic initiatives which are: number one, grow and diversify our revenue streams; two is to practice disciplined expense management; and three, to effectively deploy our capital. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave who will cover the details for the third quarter. Dave?"
271409,402034266,1056391,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to each of them as we move through the results. So let's get started with the balance sheet and look at the average loans. Average loan bal",2140,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to each of them as we move through the results. 
So let's get started with the balance sheet and look at the average loans. Average loan balances totaled $81 billion in the third quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer lending experienced another solid quarter of growth as average consumer loan balances increased $302 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending, as balances increased $259 million linked-quarter, reflecting another seasonally strong quarter of production. 
We continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $93 million linked-quarter or 14%. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $44 million or 4%, as penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 18.2%, an improvement of 50 basis points. 
Now turning to the indirect auto portfolio. Average balances decreased $36 million during the quarter. We continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network while exiting certain smaller dealers. In addition, we remain focused on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns in this portfolio. And average home equity balances decreased $94 million as the pace of runoff exceeded production. 
Now turning to the business services portfolio. As Grayson mentioned, the decrease in average business services loans during the quarter was driven by an approximate $300 million decline in average direct energy loans. In addition, loan growth was impacted by continued softness in demand for middle-market commercial and small-business loans. Furthermore, we are remaining disciplined with our management of concentration risk limits and a continued focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. More specifically, we are limiting our exposure to multifamily and medical office buildings. And as a result, total business lending average balances decreased $979 million or 2% during the quarter. Despite this decline, there are areas within business services experiencing growth such as technology and defense and asset-based lending. And we continue -- expect to continue to leverage our go-to-market strategy of local bankers working with industry and product specialists to deliver the entire bank to our customers to meet their particular needs. 
Related, we're also making progress with our focus on profitability and are using capital more effectively. Through July, we have achieved greater relevance in a number of large corporate relationships and improved our risk-adjusted returns on these loans by over 200 basis points. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances increased $439 million from the previous quarter, including $330 million of growth in average low-cost deposits. Deposit costs remained near historically low levels at 12 basis points, and total funding costs remained low, totaling 30 basis points for the quarter. Total average deposits in the consumer segment were up $483 million or 1% in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. As previously noted, average corporate segment deposits increased $675 million or 2% during the quarter as corporate customers remained focused on liquidity. Average deposits in the wealth management segment decreased $637 million or 6% during the quarter as certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments. 
So let's see how all this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income, on a fully taxable basis, was $856 million, a decrease of $13 million or 1% from the second quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.06%. Net interest income and other financing income was negatively impacted by a $7 million leverage lease residual value adjustment, and this adjustment reduced net interest margin by 3 basis points. In addition, historically low rates experienced in the second and third quarters of 2016 caused prepayments in our mortgage-backed securities book to increase, resulting in higher premium amortization of approximately $13 million during the quarter. However, given the recent moves to modestly higher long-term rates, we expect $4 million to $6 million of improvement in premium amortization during the fourth quarter. And lastly, lower average loan balances further reduced net interest income and other financing income in the quarter. These reductions were partially offset by higher short-term rates, 1 additional day in the quarter and our debt deleveraging that we executed this quarter. So if you exclude the impact of the $7 million leveraged lease residual value adjustment and the expected $4 million premium amortization improvement, net interest income and other financing income for the third quarter would have been approximately $867 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis and a margin of 3.09%. And we believe the fourth quarter will approximate these amounts. 
Noninterest income increased 14% in the quarter and included the impact of $47 million of insurance proceeds associated with the previously disclosed settlement related to FHA-insured mortgage loans. Adjusted noninterest income growth was particularly strong in the third quarter and reflected our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify revenue. Almost every noninterest revenue category increased, driven by record capital markets and wealth management income and growth in card and ATM fees, resulting in a 5% increase compared to the second quarter. 
Capital markets fee income grew $4 million or 11% during the quarter, driven primarily by the mergers and acquisition advisory services group. Card and ATM income increased $6 million or 6% during the quarter driven by an increase in the number of active cards and spend volume. Wealth management income increased $4 million or 4% during the quarter, driven by increased investment management and trustees as assets under administration increased 5% from $88.1 billion to $92.6 billion. Mortgage income was stable during the quarter as increased gains from loan sales were offset by declines in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 67% was related to purchase activity and 33% was related to refinancing. 
Also during the quarter, we completed a bulk purchase for the rights to service approximately $2.8 billion of mortgage loans. And year-to-date, we purchased the rights to service approximately $6 billion of mortgage loans, and our mortgage portfolio service for others has grown from approximately $26 billion to $30 billion over the past year. We still have additional capacity, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our servicing portfolio. 
Other noninterest income includes the recovery of $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. We also recognized an $8 million leveraged lease termination gain, which was substantially offset by a related increase in income taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decline in revenue from market value adjustments related to employee benefit assets, which were offset in salaries and benefit expense and resulted in no impact to pretax income. 
As it relates to future noninterest income growth, Regions is one of the nation's largest participants in affordable housing finance through the low income housing tax credits program, and we're excited about the opportunity to enhance our capabilities through the recently announced acquisition of the low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management businesses of First Sterling. 
So let's move on to expenses. Total noninterest expenses increased 2% during the quarter and included a $14 million charge for the early extinguishment of parent company debt and a $5 million charge associated with branch closures we announced last quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $912 million, representing a 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. Total salaries and benefits increased $6 million from the second quarter, primarily due to 1 additional weekday, which accounts for approximately $5 million. Production-based incentives also increased during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in expenses related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other noninterest income that I mentioned. In addition, year-to-date staffing levels have declined 5% or approximately 1,200 positions as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Looking at the fourth quarter and excluding any impact from market value adjustments, we expect salaries and benefits to decline as a result of 1 less weekday in the quarter and the impact of continuing expense management. 
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million during the quarter, primarily due to increases in legal reserves. As expected, FDIC insurance assessments increased $12 million in the third quarter, including a $5 million related to the implementation of the FDIC assessment surcharge. In addition, the second quarter assessment benefited from a $6 million refund related to prior period overpayments. The company also incurred $8 million related to the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $11 million of expense related to Visa Class B shares sold in a prior year. The Visa Class B shares have restrictions tied to the finalization of certain covered litigation. The current-quarter charge primarily relates to a class-action settlement that was overturned on appeal, and we would not expect this level of expense to repeat. 
For the first 9 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.3%, and we have generated 3% positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis. As Grayson mentioned, we have targeted an additional $100 million in expense eliminations beyond our original announcement, bringing the total target to $400 million or 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. And we will continue to identify opportunities to pull those savings forward whenever possible. 
Let's move on to asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $54 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million from the second quarter and represents -- represented 26 basis points of average loans. Charge-offs related to our energy portfolio totaled $6 million in the quarter. The provision for loan losses was $25 million less than net charge-offs in the quarter. And our allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, decreased 2 basis points to 1.39%. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7.9% in the third quarter compared to 9.4% in the second quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in our overall energy book. 
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased to 1.33% of loans outstanding. There were 5 energy and energy-related loans which primarily drove the increase in nonaccrual loans. However, the increased provision associated with these loans was more than offset by the credit quality improvement in the balance of the energy portfolio driven by continued energy price stabilization as well as declines in loans outstanding. 
Troubled debt restructured loans and total delinquencies were relatively flat while total business services criticized loans increased 2%. The increase in criticized loans was driven by a small number of multifamily construction and transportation loans that were downgraded from past to special mention. While oil prices are continuing to stabilize, uncertainty remains. We expect cumulative losses for all of 2016 and 2017 to range between $50 million and $75 million. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. Through the first 9 months of 2016, we have incurred $23 million of charge-offs related to our energy portfolio. And we are encouraged by the performance of our energy segment to date. However, we will continue to monitor and manage it closely. And given where we are in the credit cycle and considering fluctuation in commodity prices, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits. 
Let's talk about capital and liquidity. In the Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.9% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11%. In addition, our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. 
Now in terms of expectations for the remainder of 2016, we expect both average loans and average deposits to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter 2015. Our expectations for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged with full year growth of between the 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we now expect to grow full year adjusted noninterest income by more than 6%. Total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015, and we expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 63%, with a positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. And we continue to expect full year net charge-offs to be in that 25 to 35 basis point range. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion."

And we think while there's some seasonality in consumer lending, in particular around mortgage lending, we do anticipate that, that positive momentum carries forward. On the commercial side, especially in the small to medium-sized enterprises, we had very good production in the third quarter, but we also had an abnormally high level of payoffs and pay-downs, and in particular around reductions in outstandings on commercial lines of credit.

We have, we think too many single service, kind of credit-only relationships. We've been good about clients activity, but not as focused on returns. And so as we think about our businesses and our desire to create a better mix of revenue, we've talked about real estate and our desire to manage that carefully given where we are in the cycle. Then our larger credit exposures, our corporate banking business, again we want to be thoughtful. That business has been growing over the last few years, but it grows with large exposures. And so we're mindful of the tall tree risk and mindful of the returns that we're getting in that business. And so a lot of what we've been doing there over the last 9 months is reallocating capital within that portfolio to relationships that are going to generate higher risk-adjusted returns. And we're beginning to see meaningful impact as a result of that. And I think it's also, as you can see, helping grow noninterest revenue, which is up almost 20% year-over-year. And then finally, within middle market and small business, it's really important, we think, that again we build those relationship out broadly. We don't chase opportunities. While Grayson said production was good, we have an opportunity to generate almost, again, half as much credit as we did, but it wasn't priced appropriately or the structures we didn't think were consistent with our risk appetite. So we have some levers to pull if we felt like that we needed to do that. But we believe that a disciplined approach to building long-term, prudent, sustainable relationships that are profitable to the company, that generate value for our customers and for our shareholders is appropriate. And so we'll see stabilization, we think, in the fourth quarter and then we believe kind of modest growth, I think we've indicated, David, in 2017."

First and foremost, we want to leverage our capital to grow organically. And that's the first order of business. We want to make investments to -- for bolt-on acquisitions that we've done. You saw the one that we released yesterday. Those are important. Having a fair dividend to our shareholders is important. And then when we have excess capital that we're generating, having an appropriate return in the form of a share buyback is in order. So I think given all of that, it gives us an ability to think about capital targets relative to the risk that we have in our balance sheet. We've leverage -- we've mentioned that based on today's risk that we have that, that Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the 9.5% is where we would target over time, and we're at approximately 11%.

But all that being said, we believe in the backdrop of all that's going on, that we're all rechallenging ourselves to make sure that everything is done correctly and appropriately. And that activity is going on here, as I'm sure as it's going on everywhere. But as I've said, we've got a lot of confidence in the processes we've built. We think we're doing the right things, but more importantly, we think we're doing them the right way. But we got to make sure that, that's occurring in all aspects. And so given the backdrop, we're reviewing everything we're doing."

It's trying to get the relationship return up, which can include credit, whether it's going to include all the other products and services that we offer that customer. And so we certainly are looking at things that have a credit-only relationship that have a suboptimal return for us.

And just to underscore, the work that's being done, talk about our corporate banking portfolio, particularly Shared National Credit book, and our desire to improve returns in that business, we actually exited almost $2 billion worth of credit in the first 9 months of the year. We reallocated that capital back into new relationships and existing relationships.

And as credit continues to improve on energy, is there more room to still be releasing as we continue to see the improvements on the resi side as much as the potential improvements in energy?"

And again, a lot of that still will be driven by energy, you saw that this quarter. So as the number of energy credits got much better, we were able to reduce our overall level of provision, roughly $50 million in that book. And we'll continue to review that book every quarter as we move through the next several quarters and see how that impacts our overall numbers."

The other challenge that you have when you derisk a book, and by derisking, you sell a lot of the assets, is you don't enjoy the recovery stream after.

That's the way we go about measuring the kind of capital we need to have. We're not interested in pushing ourselves to the point we have a quantitative failure and ask for a mulligan and all those kinds of things. I think it's important that we have a capital planning process with the appropriate governance, I'm talking about the board review, that helps us establish capital based on the risk in our company. Today, we think that risk would indicate 9.5% as Common Equity Tier 1 number. We are evaluating, as Grayson mentioned, how we might change that risk profile to help us to get the appropriate amount of capital that we have to keep. Now your question really is, ""Fine, you're at 9.5 versus -- you're at 11%, you got to get it to 9.5%. How quick was the pace of change, assuming the NPR turns in exactly as it is?"" And I think that's a great question. We're going to have a lot of thought put into that, especially after learning what we did last year from CCAR submissions. And -- but I do think, we need to be real careful about indicating this as some form of panacea. I do think that we need to be prudent, very careful on how we manage this, this capital, because we have other players. We have shareholders. We have other third parties that are looking at how we think about capital, too. So being very thoughtful about it and looking at that pace, we want to go at a pace that's fair and reasonable for all interested parties. And so a lot of work needs to be done."

It's where we are today. We're going to update that in December. So to the extent that's not there, and we continued to generate capital that we're not utilizing, having an appropriate dividend that we have is important to us, bolt-on acquisitions that help. You're right. They don't use -- have a tendency to use up a lot of capital. And then outside of that, returning it to the shareholders and exceeding 100% payout ratio has been done. I think that's a learning that we picked up this past year, and we would consider that as well. You've mentioned bank acquisitions. When you look at valuation for us, right now, obviously, we have our CRA issue that we hope gets cleared up.

I think that, right now, that's just not our primary focus for -- as David mentioned, for a couple of reasons as well as others. And so our focus on organic growth, our focus on improving the fundamentals of our company, and our focus on bolt-on acquisitions that, while they don't consume a lot of capital, they also don't add a lot of risk to our company, that it's the integration, the synergies that we create, we got the ability to do that. We're pretty good at it. We think we could continue to do that. Hopefully, over time, we can even increase the pace of this kind of activity. But it doesn't -- it's a very manageable risk profile when we execute it this way. Larger acquisitions, obviously, have a very different risk profile.

We are pleased with our continued progress on fund",838,"Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing our strategic plan. We are pleased with our continued progress on fundamentals despite a challenging operating environment. David's going to take you through the details shortly, but let me just provide a few highlights. For the quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $304 million and earnings per share of $0.24. There are a number of items that impacted the quarter, which we will address as we review the results, but all in all a good quarter, a solid quarter for Regions. 
We delivered solid revenue growth by increasing deposits and noninterest income. Total adjusted revenue increased 5% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by a strong adjusted noninterest growth of 12%, clear evidence that our investments are paying off. 
Notably, capital markets and wealth management both produced record quarters. As part of our continuing efforts to grow and diversify revenue, we recently announced the acquisition of a low-income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management business of First Sterling Financial. This acquisition complements our existing low-income housing tax credit origination business and further expands our capital market capabilities and our ability to serve our customers. 
With respect to market conditions, the global macroeconomic environment continued to remain somewhat challenging. As such, it's critical that we focus on things that are within our power to control. And to that end, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next 3 years is clearly underway. However, based on current expectations for a continued low-rate, low-growth environment, we have determined that additional expense eliminations are necessary to operate in this environment, to go beyond the $300 million amount. To that end, we have targeted additional $100 million, which we expect to achieve by 2019. In total, this $400 million represents 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. 
Turning to asset quality for just a moment. We continue to see some stress in certain segments, given where we are in the cycle, but we view our overall asset quality as stable today. In addition, the continued stabilization of oil prices has positively impacted certain credit metrics. 
With regards to loans, we continue to exercise caution and remain focused on prudent and quality loan growth. Regarding business lending, average loans are down modestly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to experience muted customer demand and heavy competition in the business segment, particularly in the middle market commercial and small-business sectors. We're also seeing some large corporate customers accessing the capital markets and are using these proceeds to pay down bank debt. 
In addition, we experienced 100 basis points decline in line utilization of commercial customers during the quarter. Corporate customers remain focused on liquidity, which is evidenced by a 2% increase in average corporate bank segment deposits. 
Excluding the impact of public funds, average deposits in the corporate bank at Regions are up 5%. In addition, direct energy loans continue to pay down or pay off. And over the past 2 quarters, we have seen a favorable decline of approximately $500 million on a point-to-point basis and approximately $300 million on a linked-quarter basis. It's important to point out that while reduced demand is impacting industry, we are deliberately limiting production in certain areas. For example, investor real estate, in particular, is an area where we remain guarded. We're also limiting exposure specifically to multifamily and medical office buildings. Year-to-date, in these -- outstanding balances in these portfolios have declined approximately $300 million combined on a point-to-point basis. 
Importantly, we continue to focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns within our business, portfolios and relationships. And we believe this approach will lead to quality loan growth in the future. Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains strong, and we continue to see solid demand and steady growth in almost all of our consumer loan categories. 
With respect to capital, we are encouraged by recent regulatory directions and comments and the subsequent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which we believe will be constructive for Regions. That said, our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged. First and foremost, we're focused on prudent organic growth. We will also continue to evaluate strategic alternatives that increase revenue or reduce operating expenses, while returning an appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately 99% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, our third quarter results reflect the continued execution of our plans and our commitment to our 3 primary strategic initiatives which are: number one, grow and diversify our revenue streams; two is to practice disciplined expense management; and three, to effectively deploy our capital. 
With that, I'll turn it over to David who will cover the details for the third quarter. David?"
271409,402034266,1056472,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to each of them as we move through the results. So let's get started with the balance sheet and a look at average loans. Average loan balan",2140,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to each of them as we move through the results. 
So let's get started with the balance sheet and a look at average loans. Average loan balances totaled $81 billion in the third quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer lending experienced another solid quarter of growth as average consumer loan balances increased $302 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending, as balances increased $259 million linked-quarter, reflecting another seasonally strong quarter of production. 
We continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $93 million linked-quarter or 14%. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $44 million or 4%, as penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 18.2%, an improvement of 50 basis points. 
Now turning to the indirect auto portfolio. Average balances decreased $36 million during the quarter. We continued to focus on growing our preferred dealer network while exiting certain smaller dealers. In addition, we remain focused on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns in this portfolio. And average home equity balances decreased $94 million as the pace of runoff exceeded production. 
Now turning to the business services portfolio. As Grayson mentioned, the decrease in average business services loans during the quarter was driven by an approximate $300 million decline in average direct energy loans. In addition, loan growth was impacted by continued softness in demand for middle-market commercial and small-business loans. Furthermore, we are remaining disciplined with our management of concentration risk limits and a continued focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. More specifically, we are limiting our exposure to multifamily and medical office buildings. And as a result, total business lending average balances decreased $979 million or 2% during the quarter. Despite this decline, there are areas within business services experiencing growth such as technology and defense and asset-based lending. And we continue -- expect to continue to leverage our go-to-market strategy of local bankers working with industry and product specialists to deliver the entire bank to our customers to meet their particular needs. 
Related, we are also making progress with our focus on profitability and are using capital more effectively. Through July, we have achieved greater relevance in a number of large corporate relationships and improved our risk-adjusted returns on these loans by over 200 basis points. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances increased $439 million from the previous quarter, including $330 million of growth in average low-cost deposits. Deposit costs remained near historically low levels at 12 basis points, and total funding costs remained low, totaling 30 basis points for the quarter. Total average deposits in the consumer segment were up $483 million or 1% in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. As previously noted, average corporate segment deposits increased $675 million or 2% during the quarter as corporate customers remained focused on liquidity. Average deposits in the wealth management segment decreased $637 million or 6% during the quarter as certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments. 
So let's see how all this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income, on a fully taxable basis, was $856 million, a decrease of $13 million or 1% from the second quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.06%. Net interest income and other financing income was negatively impacted by a $7 million leverage lease residual value adjustment, and this adjustment reduced net interest margin by 3 basis points. In addition, historically low rates experienced in the second and third quarters of 2016 caused prepayments in our mortgage-backed securities book to increase, resulting in higher premium amortization of approximately $13 million during the quarter. However, given the recent moves to modestly higher long-term rates, we expect $4 million to $6 million of improvement in premium amortization during the fourth quarter. And lastly, lower average loan balances further reduced net interest income and other financing income in the quarter. These reductions were partially offset by higher short-term rates, 1 additional day in the quarter and our debt deleveraging that we executed this quarter. So if you exclude the impact of the $7 million leveraged lease residual value adjustment and the expected $4 million premium amortization improvement, net interest income and other financing income for the third quarter would have been approximately $867 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis and a margin of 3.09%. And we believe the fourth quarter will approximate these amounts. 
Noninterest income increased 14% in the quarter and included the impact of $47 million of insurance proceeds associated with the previously disclosed settlement related to FHA-insured mortgage loans. Adjusted noninterest income growth was particularly strong in the third quarter and reflected our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify revenue. Almost every noninterest revenue category increased, driven by record capital markets and wealth management income and growth in card and ATM fees, resulting in a 5% increase compared to the second quarter. 
Capital markets fee income grew $4 million or 11% during the quarter, driven primarily by the mergers and acquisition advisory services group. Card and ATM income increased $6 million or 6% during the quarter driven by an increase in the number of active cards and spend volume. Wealth management income increased $4 million or 4% during the quarter, driven by increased investment management and trustees as assets under administration increased 5% from $88.1 billion to $92.6 billion. Mortgage income was stable during the quarter as increased gains from loan sales were offset by declines in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 67% was related to purchase activity and 33% was related to refinancing. 
Also during the quarter, we completed a bulk purchase for the rights to service approximately $2.8 billion of mortgage loans. And year-to-date, we purchased the rights to service approximately $6 billion of mortgage loans, and our mortgage portfolio service for others has grown from approximately $26 billion to $30 billion over the past year. We still have additional capacity, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our servicing portfolio. 
Other noninterest income includes the recovery of $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. We also recognized an $8 million leveraged lease termination gain, which was substantially offset by a related increase in income taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decline in revenue from market value adjustments related to employee benefit assets, which were offset in salaries and benefit expense and resulted in no impact to pretax income. 
As it relates to future noninterest income growth, Regions is one of the nation's largest participants in affordable housing finance through the low income housing tax credits program, and we're excited about the opportunity to enhance our capabilities through the recently announced acquisition of the low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management businesses of First Sterling. 
So let's move on to expenses. Total noninterest expenses increased 2% during the quarter and included a $14 million charge for the early extinguishment of parent company debt and a $5 million charge associated with branch closures we announced last quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $912 million, representing a 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. Total salaries and benefits increased $6 million from the second quarter, primarily due to 1 additional weekday, which accounts for approximately $5 million. Production-based incentives also increased during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in expenses related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other noninterest income that I mentioned. In addition, year-to-date staffing levels have declined 5% or approximately 1,200 positions as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Looking at the fourth quarter and excluding any impact from market value adjustments, we expect salaries and benefits to decline as a result of 1 less weekday in the quarter and the impact of continuing expense management. 
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million during the quarter, primarily due to increases in legal reserves. As expected, FDIC insurance assessments increased $12 million in the third quarter, including a $5 million related to the implementation of the FDIC assessment surcharge. In addition, the second quarter assessment benefited from a $6 million refund related to prior period overpayments. The company also incurred $8 million related to the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $11 million of expense related to Visa Class B shares sold in a prior year. The Visa Class B shares have restrictions tied to the finalization of certain covered litigation. The current-quarter charge primarily relates to a class-action settlement that was overturned on appeal, and we would not expect this level of expense to repeat. 
For the first 9 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.3%, and we have generated 3% positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis. As Grayson mentioned, we have targeted an additional $100 million in expense eliminations beyond our original announcement, bringing the total target to $400 million or 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. And we will continue to identify opportunities to pull those savings forward whenever possible. 
Let's move on to asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $54 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million from the second quarter and represents -- represented 26 basis points of average loans. Charge-offs related to our energy portfolio totaled $6 million in the quarter. The provision for loan losses was $25 million less than net charge-offs in the quarter. And our allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, decreased 2 basis points to 1.39%. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7.9% in the third quarter compared to 9.4% in the second quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in our overall energy book. 
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased to 1.33% of loans outstanding. There were 5 energy and energy-related loans which primarily drove the increase in nonaccrual loans. However, the increased provision associated with these loans was more than offset by the credit quality improvement in the balance of the energy portfolio driven by continued energy price stabilization as well as declines in loans outstanding. 
Troubled debt restructured loans and total delinquencies were relatively flat while total business services criticized loans increased 2%. The increase in criticized loans was driven by a small number of multifamily construction and transportation loans that were downgraded from past to special mention. While oil prices are continuing to stabilize, uncertainty remains. We expect cumulative losses for all of 2016 and 2017 to range between $50 million and $75 million. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. Through the first 9 months of 2016, we have incurred $23 million of charge-offs related to our energy portfolio. And we are encouraged by the performance of our energy segment to date. However, we will continue to monitor and manage it closely. And given where we are in the credit cycle and considering fluctuation in commodity prices, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits. 
Let's talk about capital and liquidity. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.9% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11%. In addition, our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. 
Now in terms of expectations for the remainder of 2016, we expect both average loans and average deposits to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter 2015. Our expectations for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged with full year growth of between the 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we now expect to grow full year adjusted noninterest income by more than 6%. Total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015, and we expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 63%, with a positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. And we continue to expect full year net charge-offs to be in that 25 to 35 basis point range. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion."

And we think while there's some seasonality in consumer lending, in particular around mortgage lending, we do anticipate that, that positive momentum carries forward. On the commercial side, especially in the small to medium-sized enterprises, we had very good production in the third quarter, but we also had an abnormally high level of payoffs and pay-downs, and in particular around reductions in outstandings on commercial lines of credit.

We have, we think too many single service, kind of credit-only relationships. We've been good about client selectivity, but not as focused on returns. And so as we think about our businesses and our desire to create a better mix of revenue, we've talked about real estate and our desire to manage that carefully given where we are in the cycle. Then our larger credit exposures, our corporate banking business, again we want to be thoughtful. That business has been growing over the last few years, but it grows with large exposures. And so we're mindful of the tall tree risk and mindful of the returns that we're getting in that business. And so a lot of what we've been doing there over the last 9 months is reallocating capital within that portfolio to relationships that are going to generate higher risk-adjusted returns. And we're beginning to see meaningful impact as a result of that. And I think it's also, as you can see, helping grow noninterest revenue, which is up almost 20% year-over-year. And then finally, within middle market and small business, it's really important, we think, that again we build those relationship out broadly. We don't chase opportunities. While Grayson said production was good, we have an opportunity to generate almost, again, half as much credit as we did, but it wasn't priced appropriately or the structures we didn't think were consistent with our risk appetite. So we have some levers to pull if we felt like that we needed to do that. But we believe that a disciplined approach to building long-term, prudent, sustainable relationships that are profitable to the company, that generate value for our customers and for our shareholders is appropriate. And so we'll see stabilization, we think, in the fourth quarter and then we believe kind of modest growth, I think we've indicated, David, in 2017."

But based on what is out there, I think it's constructive for the industry, for the regional bank space. That being said, we manage our capital in the manner that we've laid out a capital planning process and all the governance, and none of that is going to change. We're going to continue to have robust capital planning and loss forecasting. What this does is that plus learnings that we get from each CCAR filing help us frame up what we can do with our capital. First and foremost, we want to leverage our capital to grow organically. And that's the first order of business. We want to make investments to -- for bolt-on acquisitions that we've done. You saw the one that we released yesterday. Those are important. Having a fair dividend to our shareholders is important. And then when we have excess capital that we're generating, having an appropriate return in the form of a share buyback is in order. So I think given all of that, it gives us an ability to think about capital targets relative to the risk that we have in our balance sheet. We've leverage -- we've mentioned that based on today's risk that we have that, that Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the 9.5% is where we would target over time, and we're at approximately 11%. So we have capital to be put to work or to be given back to shareholders over time. And so I think all the body of evidence that we have will help us manage that in a prudent manner over perhaps a shorter period of time. We have to think through that, though, Betsy. It's a little early to tell what that exactly means for our CCAR submission in 2017."

Higher concessions than originally expected, so we moved that to a special mention loan. Another that was also in the Houston area, construction delays due to rainfall. So we moved that one over. And the last one is in Oklahoma, 93% complete on that building, marginally behind schedule in terms of the leasing, but we still expect completion of the building by the end of December. So again, we look at everything relative to how you were supposed to be performing in any of these credits. And if you're not performing as per what we originally laid out, we will move you to a special mention. The transportation credits are energy-related. One large transportation credit, energy-related. What I would say, though, about our overall criticized book is that 93% of our criticized book in the business services area is paying as agreed. So I don't expect at the end of the day that there'll be a significant number of losses at all coming from any of those loans that we moved over."

It's trying to get the relationship return up, which can include credit, but it's going to include all the other products and services that we offer that customer. And so we certainly are looking at things that have a credit-only relationship that have a suboptimal return for us.

More importantly, though, as David talked about, I think what you're seeing is growth in fee revenue, a growth in deposits, all because of our focus on relationship returns. And just to underscore, the work that's being done, talk about our corporate banking portfolio, particularly the Shared National Credit book, and our desire to improve returns in that business, we actually exited almost $2 billion worth of credit in the first 9 months of the year. We reallocated that capital back into new relationships and existing relationships. And in doing that, we increased the revenue per relationship over 50% and the risk-adjusted returns in the business by almost 250 basis points. So we are seeing that activity really begin to have an impact, it will take some time to see it in the P&L. We believe that it is occurring and it's the right approach."

The other challenge that you have when you derisk a book, and by derisking, you sell a lot of the assets, is you don't enjoy the recovery stream after.

That's the way we go about measuring the kind of capital we need to have. We're not interested in pushing ourselves to the point where we have a quantitative failure and ask for a mulligan and all those kinds of things. I think it's important that we have a capital planning process with the appropriate governance, I'm talking about the board review, that helps us establish capital based on the risk in our company. Today, we think that risk would indicate 9.5% as the Common Equity Tier 1 number. We are evaluating, as Grayson mentioned, how we might change that risk profile to help us to get the appropriate amount of capital that we have to keep. Now your question really is, ""Fine, you're at 9.5 versus -- you're at 11%, you got to get it to 9.5%. How quick was the pace of change, assuming the NPR turns in exactly as it is?"" And I think that's a great question. We're going to have a lot of thought put into that, especially after learning what we did last year from CCAR submissions. And -- but I do think, we need to be real careful about indicating this as some form of panacea. I do think that we need to be prudent, very careful on how we manage this, this capital, because we have other players. We have shareholders. We have other third parties that are looking at how we think about capital, too. So being very thoughtful about it and looking at that pace, we want to go at the pace that's fair and reasonable for all interested parties. And so a lot of work needs to be done."

It's where we are today. We're going to update that in December. So to the extent that's not there, and we continue to generate capital that we're not utilizing, having an appropriate dividend that we have is important to us, bolt-on acquisitions that help. You're right. They don't use -- have a tendency to use up a lot of capital. And then outside of that, returning it to the shareholders and exceeding 100% payout ratio has been done. I think that's a learning that we picked up this past year, and we would consider that as well. You've mentioned bank acquisitions. When you look at valuation for us, right now, obviously, we have our CRA issue that we hope gets cleared up.

I think that, right now, that's just not our primary focus for -- as David mentioned, for a couple of reasons as well as others. And so our focus on organic growth, our focus on improving the fundamentals of our company, and our focus on bolt-on acquisitions that, while they don't consume a lot of capital, they also don't add a lot of risk to our company, that it's the integration, the synergies that we create, we got the ability to do that. We're pretty good at it. We think we could continue to do that. Hopefully, over time, we can even increase the pace of this kind of activity.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing our strategic plan. We are pleased with our continued progress on fund",838,"Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing our strategic plan. We are pleased with our continued progress on fundamentals despite a challenging operating environment. David's going to take you through the details shortly, but let me just provide a few highlights. For the quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $304 million and earnings per share of $0.24. There are a number of items that impacted the quarter, which we will address as we review the results, but all in all a good quarter, a solid quarter for Regions. 
We delivered solid revenue growth by increasing deposits and noninterest income. Total adjusted revenue increased 5% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by a strong adjusted noninterest growth of 12%, clear evidence that our investments are paying off. 
Notably, capital markets and wealth management both produced record quarters. As part of our continuing efforts to grow and diversify revenue, we recently announced the acquisition of a low-income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management business of First Sterling Financial. This acquisition complements our existing low-income housing tax credit origination business and further expands our capital market capabilities and our ability to serve our customers. 
With respect to market conditions, the global macroeconomic environment continued to remain somewhat challenging. As such, it's critical that we focus on things that are within our power to control. And to that end, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next 3 years is clearly underway. However, based on current expectations for a continued low-rate, low-growth environment, we have determined that additional expense eliminations are necessary to operate in this environment, to go beyond the $300 million amount. To that end, we have targeted additional $100 million, which we expect to achieve by 2019. In total, this $400 million represents 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. 
Turning to asset quality for just a moment. We continue to see some stress in certain segments, given where we are in the cycle, but we view our overall asset quality as stable today. In addition, the continued stabilization of oil prices has positively impacted certain credit metrics. 
With regards to loans, we continue to exercise caution and remain focused on prudent and quality loan growth. Regarding business lending, average loans are down modestly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to experience muted customer demand and heavy competition in the business segment, particularly in the middle market commercial and small-business sectors. We're also seeing some large corporate customers accessing the capital markets and are using these proceeds to pay down bank debt. 
In addition, we experienced 100 basis points decline in line utilization of commercial customers during the quarter. Corporate customers remain focused on liquidity, which is evidenced by a 2% increase in average corporate bank segment deposits. 
Excluding the impact of public funds, average deposits in the corporate bank at Regions are up 5%. In addition, direct energy loans continue to pay down or pay off. And over the past 2 quarters, we have seen a favorable decline of approximately $500 million on a point-to-point basis and approximately $300 million on a linked-quarter basis. It's important to point out that while reduced demand is impacting industry, we are deliberately limiting production in certain areas. For example, investor real estate, in particular, is an area where we remain guarded. We're also limiting exposure specifically to multifamily and medical office buildings. Year-to-date, in these -- outstanding balances in these portfolios have declined approximately $300 million combined on a point-to-point basis. 
Importantly, we continue to focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns within our business, portfolios and relationships. And we believe this approach will lead to quality loan growth in the future. Despite market uncertainty, the overall health of the consumer remains strong, and we continue to see solid demand and steady growth in almost all of our consumer loan categories. 
With respect to capital, we are encouraged by recent regulatory directions and comments and the subsequent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which we believe will be constructive for Regions. That said, our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged. First and foremost, we're focused on prudent organic growth. We will also continue to evaluate strategic alternatives that increase revenue or reduce operating expenses, while returning an appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately 99% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In closing, our third quarter results reflect the continued execution of our plans and our commitment to our 3 primary strategic initiatives which are: number one, grow and diversify our revenue streams; two is to practice disciplined expense management; and three, to effectively deploy our capital. 
With that, I'll turn it over to David who will cover the details for the third quarter. David?"
271409,402034266,1056708,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to each of them as we move through the results. So let's get started with the balance sheet and a look at average loans. Average loan balan",2140,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to each of them as we move through the results. 
So let's get started with the balance sheet and a look at average loans. Average loan balances totaled $81 billion in the third quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer lending experienced another solid quarter of growth as average consumer loan balances increased $302 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending, as balances increased $259 million linked-quarter, reflecting another seasonally strong quarter of production. 
We continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $93 million linked-quarter or 14%. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $44 million or 4%, as penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 18.2%, an improvement of 50 basis points. 
Now turning to the indirect auto portfolio. Average balances decreased $36 million during the quarter. We continued to focus on growing our preferred dealer network while exiting certain smaller dealers. In addition, we remain focused on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns in this portfolio. And average home equity balances decreased $94 million as the pace of runoff exceeded production. 
Now turning to the business services portfolio. As Grayson mentioned, the decrease in average business services loans during the quarter was driven by an approximate $300 million decline in average direct energy loans. In addition, loan growth was impacted by continued softness in demand for middle-market commercial and small-business loans. Furthermore, we are remaining disciplined with our management of concentration risk limits and a continued focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. More specifically, we are limiting our exposure to multifamily and medical office buildings. And as a result, total business lending average balances decreased $979 million or 2% during the quarter. Despite this decline, there are areas within business services experiencing growth such as technology and defense and asset-based lending. And we continue -- expect to continue to leverage our go-to-market strategy of local bankers working with industry and product specialists to deliver the entire bank to our customers to meet their particular needs. 
Related, we are also making progress with our focus on profitability and are using capital more effectively. Through July, we have achieved greater relevance in a number of large corporate relationships and improved our risk-adjusted returns on these loans by over 200 basis points. 
Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances increased $439 million from the previous quarter, including $330 million of growth in average low-cost deposits. Deposit costs remained near historically low levels at 12 basis points, and total funding costs remained low, totaling 30 basis points for the quarter. Total average deposits in the consumer segment were up $483 million or 1% in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. As previously noted, average corporate segment deposits increased $675 million or 2% during the quarter as corporate customers remained focused on liquidity. Average deposits in the wealth management segment decreased $637 million or 6% during the quarter as certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments. 
So let's see how all this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income, on a fully taxable basis, was $856 million, a decrease of $13 million or 1% from the second quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.06%. Net interest income and other financing income was negatively impacted by a $7 million leverage lease residual value adjustment, and this adjustment reduced net interest margin by 3 basis points. In addition, historically low rates experienced in the second and third quarters of 2016 caused prepayments in our mortgage-backed securities book to increase, resulting in higher premium amortization of approximately $13 million during the quarter. However, given the recent moves to modestly higher long-term rates, we expect $4 million to $6 million of improvement in premium amortization during the fourth quarter. And lastly, lower average loan balances further reduced net interest income and other financing income in the quarter. These reductions were partially offset by higher short-term rates, 1 additional day in the quarter and our debt deleveraging that we executed this quarter. So if you exclude the impact of the $7 million leveraged lease residual value adjustment and the expected $4 million premium amortization improvement, net interest income and other financing income for the third quarter would have been approximately $867 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis and a margin of 3.09%. And we believe the fourth quarter will approximate these amounts. 
Noninterest income increased 14% in the quarter and included the impact of $47 million of insurance proceeds associated with the previously disclosed settlement related to FHA-insured mortgage loans. Adjusted noninterest income growth was particularly strong in the third quarter and reflected our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify revenue. Almost every noninterest revenue category increased, driven by record capital markets and wealth management income and growth in card and ATM fees, resulting in a 5% increase compared to the second quarter. 
Capital markets fee income grew $4 million or 11% during the quarter, driven primarily by the mergers and acquisition advisory services group. Card and ATM income increased $6 million or 6% during the quarter driven by an increase in the number of active cards and spend volume. Wealth management income increased $4 million or 4% during the quarter, driven by increased investment management and trustees as assets under administration increased 5% from $88.1 billion to $92.6 billion. Mortgage income was stable during the quarter as increased gains from loan sales were offset by declines in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 67% was related to purchase activity and 33% was related to refinancing. 
Also during the quarter, we completed a bulk purchase for the rights to service approximately $2.8 billion of mortgage loans. And year-to-date, we purchased the rights to service approximately $6 billion of mortgage loans, and our mortgage portfolio service for others has grown from approximately $26 billion to $30 billion over the past year. We still have additional capacity, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our servicing portfolio. 
Other noninterest income includes the recovery of $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. We also recognized an $8 million leveraged lease termination gain, which was substantially offset by a related increase in income taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decline in revenue from market value adjustments related to employee benefit assets, which were offset in salaries and benefit expense and resulted in no impact to pretax income. 
As it relates to future noninterest income growth, Regions is one of the nation's largest participants in affordable housing finance through the low income housing tax credits program, and we're excited about the opportunity to enhance our capabilities through the recently announced acquisition of the low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management businesses of First Sterling. 
So let's move on to expenses. Total noninterest expenses increased 2% during the quarter and included a $14 million charge for the early extinguishment of parent company debt and a $5 million charge associated with branch closures we announced last quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $912 million, representing a 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. Total salaries and benefits increased $6 million from the second quarter, primarily due to 1 additional weekday, which accounts for approximately $5 million. Production-based incentives also increased during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in expenses related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other noninterest income that I mentioned. In addition, year-to-date staffing levels have declined 5% or approximately 1,200 positions as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Looking at the fourth quarter and excluding any impact from market value adjustments, we expect salaries and benefits to decline as a result of 1 less weekday in the quarter and the impact of continuing expense management. 
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million during the quarter, primarily due to increases in legal reserves. As expected, FDIC insurance assessments increased $12 million in the third quarter, including a $5 million related to the implementation of the FDIC assessment surcharge. In addition, the second quarter assessment benefited from a $6 million refund related to prior period overpayments. The company also incurred $8 million related to the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $11 million of expense related to Visa Class B shares sold in a prior year. The Visa Class B shares have restrictions tied to the finalization of certain covered litigation. The current-quarter charge primarily relates to a class-action settlement that was overturned on appeal, and we would not expect this level of expense to repeat. 
For the first 9 months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.3%, and we have generated 3% positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis. As Grayson mentioned, we have targeted an additional $100 million in expense eliminations beyond our original announcement, bringing the total target to $400 million or 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. And we will continue to identify opportunities to pull those savings forward whenever possible. 
Let's move on to asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $54 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million from the second quarter and represents -- represented 26 basis points of average loans. Charge-offs related to our energy portfolio totaled $6 million in the quarter. The provision for loan losses was $25 million less than net charge-offs in the quarter. And our allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, decreased 2 basis points to 1.39%. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7.9% in the third quarter compared to 9.4% in the second quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in our overall energy book. 
Total nonaccrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased to 1.33% of loans outstanding. There were 5 energy and energy-related loans which primarily drove the increase in nonaccrual loans. However, the increased provision associated with these loans was more than offset by the credit quality improvement in the balance of the energy portfolio driven by continued energy price stabilization as well as declines in loans outstanding. 
Troubled debt restructured loans and total delinquencies were relatively flat while total business services criticized loans increased 2%. The increase in criticized loans was driven by a small number of multifamily construction and transportation loans that were downgraded from past to special mention. While oil prices are continuing to stabilize, uncertainty remains. We expect cumulative losses for all of 2016 and 2017 to range between $50 million and $75 million. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. Through the first 9 months of 2016, we have incurred $23 million of charge-offs related to our energy portfolio. And we are encouraged by the performance of our energy segment to date. However, we will continue to monitor and manage it closely. And given where we are in the credit cycle and considering fluctuation in commodity prices, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits. 
Let's talk about capital and liquidity. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.9% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11%. In addition, our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. 
Now in terms of expectations for the remainder of 2016, we expect both average loans and average deposits to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter 2015. Our expectations for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged with full year growth of between the 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we now expect to grow full year adjusted noninterest income by more than 6%. Total adjusted noninterest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015, and we expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 63%, with a positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. And we continue to expect full year net charge-offs to be in that 25 to 35 basis point range. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion."

And we think while there's some seasonality in consumer lending, in particular around mortgage lending, we do anticipate that, that positive momentum carries forward. On the commercial side, especially in the small to medium-sized enterprises, we had very good production in the third quarter, but we also had an abnormally high level of payoffs and pay-downs, and in particular around reductions in outstandings on commercial lines of credit.

We have, we think too many single service, kind of credit-only relationships. We've been good about client selectivity, but not as focused on returns. And so as we think about our businesses and our desire to create a better mix of revenue, we've talked about real estate and our desire to manage that carefully given where we are in the cycle. Then our larger credit exposures, our corporate banking business, again we want to be thoughtful. That business has been growing over the last few years, but it grows with large exposures. And so we're mindful of the tall tree risk and mindful of the returns that we're getting in that business. And so a lot of what we've been doing there over the last 9 months is reallocating capital within that portfolio to relationships that are going to generate higher risk-adjusted returns. And we're beginning to see meaningful impact as a result of that. And I think it's also, as you can see, helping grow noninterest revenue, which is up almost 20% year-over-year. And then finally, within middle market and small business, it's really important, we think, that again we build those relationship out broadly. We don't chase opportunities. While Grayson said production was good, we have an opportunity to generate almost, again, half as much credit as we did, but it wasn't priced appropriately or the structures we didn't think were consistent with our risk appetite. So we have some levers to pull if we felt like that we needed to do that. But we believe that a disciplined approach to building long-term, prudent, sustainable relationships that are profitable to the company, that generate value for our customers and for our shareholders is appropriate. And so we'll see stabilization, we think, in the fourth quarter and then we believe kind of modest growth, I think we've indicated, David, in 2017."

Mortgage is really back to its all-time low, tracking along the bottom. Some of the other portfolios that we see, indirect is pretty stable. And then, of course, we have a handful of new initiatives that we're looking at. That contributed a little bit -- a few million, to our numbers overall. But again on the revenue side, we're seeing that handful of increased losses are more than offset by the increased revenues. So we don't see the consumer book moving up significantly in terms of overall losses at this point."

But based on what is out there, I think it's constructive for the industry, for the regional bank space. That being said, we manage our capital in the manner that we've laid out a capital planning process and all the governance, and none of that is going to change. We're going to continue to have robust capital planning and loss forecasting. What this does is that plus learnings that we get from each CCAR filing help us frame up what we can do with our capital. First and foremost, we want to leverage our capital to grow organically. And that's the first order of business. We want to make investments to -- for bolt-on acquisitions that we've done. You saw the one that we released yesterday. Those are important. Having a fair dividend to our shareholders is important. And then when we have excess capital that we're generating, having an appropriate return in the form of a share buyback is in order. So I think given all of that, it gives us an ability to think about capital targets relative to the risk that we have in our balance sheet. We've leverage -- we've mentioned that based on today's risk that we have that, that Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the 9.5% is where we would target over time, and we're at approximately 11%. So we have capital to be put to work or to be given back to shareholders over time. And so I think all the body of evidence that we have will help us manage that in a prudent manner over perhaps a shorter period of time. We have to think through that, though, Betsy.

We're continuing to build out our debt capital markets platform and doing that across a number of different products and capabilities. So what you've seen is we've grown capital markets revenues significantly over the last 2 years as the introduction of some of those products and capabilities. We had a very nice third quarter, largely built on the M&A advisory revenue that we generated. We also had a pretty good quarter in real estate permanent placements, particularly through our Fannie DUS license. We expect to continue to see that kind of growth going forward, as we continue to leverage these new capabilities. We're excited about the acquisition of the First Sterling businesses. The community investment capital business is one that's been very important to us. We decided that we wanted to grow that business strategically 2 years ago. We've set out to find a syndication platform that would help us build out some distribution capabilities that we didn't have. So again, that's another product capability that we have that will allow us to meet customer needs, grow revenue in a more diverse and balanced way. And we expect to see, again, nice growth in capital markets and in 2017 as we leverage more of these capabilities."

So your number is not too far off for the first quarter. I would tell you, as we think about the returns, improving our returns, that's not just a pricing issue only. It's really the relationship. It's trying to get the relationship return up, which can include credit, but it's going to include all the other products and services that we offer that customer. And so we certainly are looking at things that have a credit-only relationship that have a suboptimal return for us. And those are the ones we want to try and get the relationship, get our pricing through, get our returns better or recycling and leveraging that capital into another option or another alternative. So I think, over time, what you ought to see is, we should have some positive impacts to margin, the pace of which is really dependent on how we change this whole relationship and whether its credit-related or product and service-driven."

More importantly, though, as David talked about, I think what you're seeing is growth in fee revenue, a growth in deposits, all because of our focus on relationship returns. And just to underscore, the work that's being done, talk about our corporate banking portfolio, particularly the Shared National Credit book, and our desire to improve returns in that business, we actually exited almost $2 billion worth of credit in the first 9 months of the year. We reallocated that capital back into new relationships and existing relationships. And in doing that, we increased the revenue per relationship over 50% and the risk-adjusted returns in the business by almost 250 basis points. So we are seeing that activity really begin to have an impact, it will take some time to see it in the P&L. We believe that it is occurring and it's the right approach."

The other challenge that you have when you derisk a book, and by derisking, you sell a lot of the assets, is you don't enjoy the recovery stream after.

So an example would be our release we had yesterday. You'll see expenses coming through from that investment in 2017 and none in '16. And so we're trying to figure out how to pay for that by having other savings. So part of that $400 million is to compensate us for that. We do have built-in natural inflation that we have, salary increases and the like, that we try to curtail by ensuring that we have the right number of people, the right number or the right kinds of people to manage our business, run our businesses. We're down some 1,200 people. We continue to challenge ourselves on that. And you see some of that manifest in the branch consolidations that we've had during the year. So the question is, ""How do we keep the $880 million to $885 million as stable to up modestly as we can, while we're making the investments to grow revenue and having things like First Sterling with 12 months’ worth of expense next year and, virtually, none in '16?""

That's the way we go about measuring the kind of capital we need to have. We're not interested in pushing ourselves to the point where we have a quantitative failure and ask for a mulligan and all those kinds of things. I think it's important that we have a capital planning process with the appropriate governance, I'm talking about the board review, that helps us establish capital based on the risk in our company. Today, we think that risk would indicate 9.5% as the Common Equity Tier 1 number. We are evaluating, as Grayson mentioned, how we might change that risk profile to help us to get the appropriate amount of capital that we have to keep. Now your question really is, ""Fine, you're at 9.5 versus -- you're at 11%, you got to get it to 9.5%. How quick was the pace of change, assuming the NPR turns in exactly as it is?"" And I think that's a great question. We're going to have a lot of thought put into that, especially after learning what we did last year from CCAR submissions. And -- but I do think, we need to be real careful about indicating this as some form of panacea. I do think that we need to be prudent, very careful on how we manage this, this capital, because we have other players. We have shareholders. We have other third parties that are looking at how we think about capital, too.

It's where we are today. We're going to update that in December. So to the extent that's not there, and we continue to generate capital that we're not utilizing, having an appropriate dividend that we have is important to us, bolt-on acquisitions that help. You're right. They don't use -- have a tendency to use up a lot of capital. And then outside of that, returning it to the shareholders and exceeding 100% payout ratio has been done. I think that's a learning that we picked up this past year, and we would consider that as well. You've mentioned bank acquisitions. When you look at valuation for us, right now, obviously, we have our CRA issue that we hope gets cleared up.

I think that, right now, that's just not our primary focus for -- as David mentioned, for a couple of reasons as well as others. And so our focus on organic growth, our focus on improving the fundamentals of our company, and our focus on bolt-on acquisitions that, while they don't consume a lot of capital, they also don't add a lot of risk to our company, that it's the integration, the synergies that we create, we got the ability to do that. We're pretty good at it. We think we could continue to do that. Hopefully, over time, we can even increase the pace of this kind of activity.
