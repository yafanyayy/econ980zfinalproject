As you are aware, the fourth quarter marked a major milestone for our company. We completed the separation from GE through the successful execution of the exchange offer. We are very proud of this significant accomplishment. There are likely several new shareholders on the call today as a result. We welcome you and several previous owners that may have opted for largest stakes in our company during the time of transition. We thank you for all your support in making this transaction a success, and the team looks forward to seeing you this year. We are excited about our future prospects as a focused stand-alone company and look forward to reporting our progress to you. We were honored to have our stock added to the S&P 500 Index upon consummation of the exchange offer. This is a testament to our strong position among leading financial services companies. 
During the call today, I will first provide a review of the fourth quarter. Brian will then give more details on our financial results and outline our 2016 outlook. Finally, I will conclude with the overview of our strategic priorities. 
I'll begin on Slide 3. Fourth quarter net earnings totaled $547 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Overall strong momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong purchase volume, receivables and platform revenue growth for this quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, purchase volume grew 8% with holiday sales supporting this strong growth. Online and mobile sales volume was a key component of our holiday sales. 
Our online and mobile sales growth steadily accelerated throughout last year, with fourth quarter sales growing 33% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which have been in the 14% to 15% range. 
We delivered another quarter of strong receivables growth. Loan receivables were up 11% and platform revenue grew 5%. Asset quality strengthened as demonstrated by a 9 basis point decline in our net charge-off rate and an 8 basis point improvement in 30-plus day delinquencies. Expenses were aligned with our expectations with the increase being largely driven by investments we made in support of growth initiatives as well as the infrastructure build associated with our establishment as a stand-alone company.
Deposit growth continued at a very strong pace with deposits increasing $8 billion or 24% to $43 billion. Deposits now comprise 64% of our funding sources, squarely in line with our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results. .
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank and we plan on launching new product offerings later this year to grow and further boost the retention of our deposit base.
Our balance sheet remains strong with the common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.8% calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter-end. During this time of transition, we remained very focused on driving business momentum. During the fourth quarter alone, we renewed several key relationships including Dick's Sporting Goods, Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring. We also launched 2 of our recent wins with Newegg and Stash Hotel Rewards. We are enthusiastic about the prospects for these relationships and our ability to continue delivering significant value to these programs. Driving organic growth remains a key opportunity and we rigorously pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepened penetration across all of our partnerships. Given the rapid pace of change within the digital payments area, online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business and we are seizing the opportunities that are being presented to us by the swiftly changing environment. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships, we are helping to shape the future of how private label card function in mobile log [ph] and provide value to our merchants and their consumers across mobile channels.
This quarter, we launched to 2 mobile applications that leverage innovative technology to provide enhanced functionality across our mobile product suite. Both of these efforts [ph] build upon collaboration with our strategic partner, GP Sharper [ph], a leader in integrated mobile platforms among retail clients. First, we launched the CareCredit mobile application. This app available in the Apple Store and Google Play enables millions of CareCredit cardholders convenient access to account servicing options. It includes the ability to locate health care providers and health-focused merchants, which can facilitate the connection across CareCredit more than 195,000 total merchant locations. The app also features access to a digital card and offers a variety of value-added notifications and updates. We already have seen more than 700,000 business to date. 
We also launched the CarCareONE mobile app, which readily connects millions of CarCareONE cardholders to more than 23,000 automotive-related merchants nationwide. Users can quickly and easily access account servicing, a location finder and offers such as special financing on their smartphones. We also launched the pilot with JCPenney to offer their private label credit cards in Apple Pay. We continue to seek ways to increase the utility of our cards and their usage. Mobile applications are one of the ways we can readily connect cardholders at partners. In doing so, we improved the experience for the cardholder, helped to increase engagement and ultimately drive more purchase volume. 
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11% primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 5%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 5% over the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing and marketing offers that will resonate with our partners and customers.
On the next slide, I'll discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail. We continue to deliver solid performance across all 3 of our sales platforms in the fourth quarter. Retail Card generated strong performance this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 8% and receivables grew 12%. The addition of BP in the second quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 5%. As you may recall, there was a $46 million gain on sale of portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2014, extending our program to remain a key priority in this business and our success on this front is a testament to the strength and depth of our partnership. This quarter, we renewed our long-standing relationship with Dick’s Sporting Goods, a key partner. With this expansion, we have nearly 92% of our Retail Card receivables on the contract to 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnership we have developed provide a solid foundation for future growth.
Payment Solutions delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 9% and receivables grew 12%, driving platform revenue growth of 7%. Average active accounts increased 11% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase line and receivables with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We were very pleased to have extended our long-term relationship with Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring this quarter. 
CareCredit had a solid quarter. Purchase volume growth was 9% and receivables grew 7%, driving platform revenue growth of 3%. Average active accounts increased 6% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was once again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. In terms of business developments, we announced that Rite Aid is now accepting our CareCredit cards for prescription and general merchandise purchases in all 4,600 Rite Aid stores in the United States. CareCredit also announced the expansion of the patient financing agreement with National Vision, one of the largest optical retails in the U.S., with over 800 locations across 43 states.
In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continued to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for 2016."

I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter, the business earned $547 million of net income, which translates to $0.65 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purcha",2575,"Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter, the business earned $547 million of net income, which translates to $0.65 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and platform revenue up 5%. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business in 2015. The value propositions on our cards continued to resonate with consumers. The business delivered growth in average active accounts as well as increases in purchase volume and the average balance per active account compared to last year.
We also post the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter, so that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year. Platform revenue included a $46 million gain on sale of the portfolios in the fourth quarter of last year. And excluding the gain, platform revenue growth was 7%. Net interest income was up 8% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables.
RSAs were up $36 million or 5% compared to last year's RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were slightly under 4.5% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. On a full year basis, RSAs were 4.4% of average receivables in 2015 compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due to programs we exited last year where we paid a higher RSA as a percentage of average receivables as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. The RSA percentage on a full year basis has been relatively stable around 4.5% for the past 3 years. The provision increased $26 million or 3% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth, partially offset by the improvement in asset quality. The improvement in asset quality is reflected in lower 30-plus delinquencies, which improved 8 basis points versus last year to 4.06% and then the net charge-off rate which fell to 4.23%, 9 basis points below last year. 
Our balance for loan losses as a percent of receivables is down 16 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year to 5.2%. However, measured against the last 4 quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3x. This is consistent with the coverage level over the past 4 quarters, which has been in the 1.2x to 1.3x range. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable.
Other income decreased $75 million versus last year primarily driven by the $46 million gain on portfolio of sales last year but also higher loyalty and rewards costs, partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $27 million, driven by continued growth in auto store spending on our Dual Card. This is offset by loyalty expense that was up $34 million primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to our RSAs where there's a partial offset in each of these items. 
Debt cancellation fees of $62 million were down $5 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now for our online channel. Other expenses increased $78 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to the infrastructure build that is now in the expense run rate, the majority of the increase was driven by growth and strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. 
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 34% and 33.5% year-to-date, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%, and I'll cover the expense trend in more detail later. 
Overall, we had strong top line growth and drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.6%. I move to Slide 7 and go to our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 8%, driven by loan receivable growth. The net interest margin was 15.73% for the fourth quarter, 13 basis points higher than last year. As we had expected and noted on our third quarter earnings call, the margin experienced a seasonal decline from the third quarter due to the buildup in receivables. However, the margin was above the guidance of 15% to 15.5% we set out back in January. 
As you look in the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. While the yield on receivables was relatively stable at 21.2%, we didn't see a slight improvement in interest-earning asset yields as we carried a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average for the quarter.
Cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.8% due to a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan facility and the payoff of that GE Capital loan, which offset the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance. 
Our deposit base increased by over $8 billion or 24% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we've made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 64% of our funding versus 56% last year. And while the fourth quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which exceeded our guidance for the year. 
Next I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality. 30-plus delinquencies were at 4.06%, down 8 basis points versus last year. 90-plus delinquencies were 1.86%, down 4 basis points. We continue to believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends compared to last year.
The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.23%, down 9 basis points versus last year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.12%, which was down 16 basis points from the prior year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we're currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5-month loss coverage in our reserve. As I noted earlier, this is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of the portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line and we delivered on our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Expenses came in at $870 million for the quarter and compared to last year are largely driven by separation-related costs, growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities. 
Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $58 million as we've added employees over the past year and [indiscernible] to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were up $26 million, driven primarily by growth. Marketing and business development costs were down $37 million. The decrease was attributable to lower spend on brand advertising and marketing associated with our direct deposit products. As you may recall, last year, we did a major brand advertising campaign following our IPO. Also, given the strong growth in deposits, we were able to dial back some of our deposit-related marketing spend in the quarter. 
Information processing was up $23 million driven by, higher IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. The efficiency ratio was 34% for the quarter as seasonally driven expenses tend to peak in the fourth quarter. The ratio was 33.5% for 2015 in line with our expectation of below 34% for the year.
Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $8 billion primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 64% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. So while we have moved further within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth on our deposit direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $13 billion to $15 billion range, which is approximately 20% of our funding. This is consistent with our approach to maintaining securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loans and senior unsecured notes totaled 16% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business compared to deposits and other lower-cost funding sources. We have continued to pay this down, making a $500 million prepayment in early December and we also made a $1 billion prepayment in early January that will be reflected in the first quarter outstanding balance.
Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $3.2 billion currently, and we expect to continue to pay this down in future quarters. We also expect to continue issuing unsecured bonds and we issued $1 billion in 3-year fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in December. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility.
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 16.8% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 15.9% CET1 under the fully phased and Basel III rules. This compares to 14.5% on a fully phased end basis last year, an increase of 140 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $20.9 billion and includes $14.8 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LTR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LTR levels. Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital liquidity levels. 
Next on Slide 11, I'll recap our 2015 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our growth of 11% exceeded our outlook range of 6% to 8%. The growth in 2015 was driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth as well as the addition of BP and other program wins. Net interest margin was 15.8% for the year, which is better than the 15% to 15.5% range we provided back in January. We have continued to look for ways to deploy excess liquidity generated from strong deposit growth, taking the opportunity to pay down higher cost funding sources. 
Our net charge-off rate was slightly better than we had expected with net charge-offs improving 18 basis points. We attribute this to our improved credit profile as well as the improving economic environment and likely some benefit from lower gas prices. The efficiency ratio for the year was 33.5%, which was in line with our guidance of below 34% for the year. Despite the investment we made to build our stand-alone infrastructure, our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry. We feel well positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. And lastly, we generated return on assets of 2.9%, which was at the upper end of our guidance for 2015. So overall, we were pleased with the results of our financial performance in 2015. 
Moving to our 2016 outlook on Slide 12. Our macro assumptions for 2016 are consistent with the consensus views on forward rates and unemployment. Our framework assumes Fed tightens [ph] 15 basis points this year and a stable to slightly improving unemployment rate. Our guidance for our receivable growth is in the 7% to 9% range. We expect it will continue to grow sales volumes at 2 to 3x broader retail sales. This guidance doesn't assume any significant new portfolio acquisition. We believe our margin will be in the 15.5% range this year. If rates do increase during the year, we expect our neutral to slightly asset-sensitive position would provide a small benefit to our net interest income. In terms of our funding plan more broadly, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect to move towards the higher end of our target of 60% to 70% deposit funding in 2016. 
We will also continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets and we use the proceeds to continue to pay down the bank term loan well in advance of the contractual maturity in 2019. In terms of credit, given the view that unemployment will be stable to slightly improving this year and our plan not to change our underwriting profile, we believe our net charge-off rate will continue to be relatively stable in the 4.3% to 4.5% range we experienced in 2014 and 2015. And while we expect net charge-offs to be stable, we do not believe the benefit we received in our reserve bill in 2015 will repeat and reserve post in 2016 will be more in line with receivables growth.
Moving to the efficiency ratio. We continue to plan on running the business with an efficiency ratio below 34% on a full year basis in 2016. Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry and we feel well positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. Finally, we continue to expect to generate a return on assets in the 2.5% to 3% range in 2016 consistent with our guidance for 2015. 
Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2016. As I stated in the past, although we are not subject to CCAR, we are planning to follow a very similar process. We will use in the Fed's CCAR assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that we'll review with our board and our regulators in early April and hope to hear back from the Fed in June. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, our plans will include both dividends and share buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

First, we remain focused on driving growth both organically and through new program wins across our 3 platforms. We have historically produced organic growth of 2 to 3x market growth rates and we expect to continue to deliver similar growth. Innovative value propositions and enhanced functionality and utility for card users are some of the ways in which we will accomplish this. For example, we rolled out several compelling value propositions. Innovative programs like these and network expansions such as the one we initiated with Rite Aid for our CareCredit cards helped increase penetration. We also run our 20 new deals last year and the pipeline remains strong. We have a demonstrated track record of success that we plan to continue to leverage this year and beyond as we seek to add new partners and programs with an attractive risk and return profile. 
Second, we will continue to extend our robust data, analytics and technology offerings. We will continue our mobile development for private label credit cards such as the pilot with JCPenney and Apple Pay. Our digital strategies have helped drive an increase in online and mobile purchase volume at a faster pace than the national growth rate. We are focused on leveraging our leading capabilities as the digital landscape evolves. We are expanding our robust data and analytics capabilities through investments in Big Data technologies and insight tools such as data visualization software. Our partners highly value the insights we bring and the impact it has on our programs. 
Third, we will continue to position our business for long-term growth. We will focus on building our Synchrony bank franchise into a full-scale online bank through the development of a broad product suite to increase loyalty, diversify our funding sources and drive profitability. During 2015, we grew deposit a strong 24%. We will also leverage and explore adjacencies to our core business for growth opportunities such as expanding our small business platform. 
Fourth, we will continue operating our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong liquidity and capital to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets. We intend to maintain earnings growth at attractive returns while demonstrating operating leverage. 
Finally, we are highly focused on positioning the business to return capital to shareholders. And now that we are fully separated from GE, we will look to return capital this year through the establishment of a dividend and share repurchase program subject to board and regulatory approval. We believe these are the right areas of focus and plan to leverage our prior success to pave the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress. 
I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

We're going to be thoughtful around the first half. I think the other thing that you've got to keep in mind as you think about our capital return is we are growing our risk-weighted assets faster than most of the peer set. So if you just assume, let's just take the midpoint of our guidance, 8% RWA growth, we would need to retain roughly 35% of our earnings to support growth and keep the capital ratios flat. So over the long term, anything over a 65% payout ratio will then start to bring our capital ratios down more in line with peers."

In terms of how to think about the margin for 2016, I think there's a few puts and takes. Obviously, we will see slight benefits we think from deposit growth and interest rates. As I mentioned earlier, we built in 2 more kind of rounds of tightening 50 basis points for the year. We'll get a slight benefit from that. But then we also expect to see some slight offsets for growth and promotional balances. We saw that in 2015. Payment Solutions growth continues to outpace the other platforms and those balances come on initially at a lower yield. And yes, we did see higher payment rates more broadly across the portfolio in 2015. So we try to account for all of that in the guidance of about 15.5% feels right for 2016."

So yes, if you're looking at the ROA and you're -- if you're building off at 2015, the one thing to think about is the reserve build, which I mentioned earlier on the call. So we did receive a fairly significant benefit in the reserve bill from improved performance, particularly in the first half. So in the first quarter, we only posted $19 million of reserves. We posted $47 million in the second quarter. So while we were building reserves, we were getting a fairly significant offset in the first half. And given we expect credit to stabilize from here, we'd expect to see a higher reserve build in the first half of 2016, so more in line with our receivables growth. And so if you take that back to ROA, we'd expect to start the year closer to the midpoint of the range. And then similar to what you saw this year in the second half, it usually ticks up a bit in the third quarter and that's where we hit that seasonal low on charge-offs and it typically ticks down a bit in the fourth quarter with a higher marketing spend in the seasonal charge-offs.

So if you adjust for that, expenses were up 7%, so more in line with growth. And the expense growth, the 7% growth, was really largely driven by the investments we're making in long-term growth of the business as well as active accounts were up. Obviously, receivables up et cetera. As you think about 2016, we gave you very similar guidance on the efficiency ratio of below 34%. Maybe I'll just spend a minute describing how we think about it. First, I'd say we're very focus on driving productivity and operating leverage across the business. We'll continue to get more efficient across the business. We always start the year with a slew of productivity initiatives. We're driving things like moving more customers to e-statements and off of paper. We're improving the efficiency of our call center and collections teams. And we're also -- we're always trying to simplify and reduce the back office and IT systems. Okay, and then we take those savings and we make investments that we believe are going to drive the long-term growth of our business. So we're investing in things like mobile, in data analytics, CRM. And so we're very focused on driving operating leverage but we're not so wed to the efficiency ratio that we're going to stop investing in these long-term growth areas."

And then on platform revenue, this also stands out a bit. If you adjust for the $46 million gain on sale that we had in the fourth quarter of last year and the fact that we had 2 less days this quarter, revenue was up 9%, which is more in line with receivables growth."

What I would say on in terms of portfolio itself and the impact on delinquencies in the oil and gas areas, obviously, we watched that. We're not really seeing too much of a shift there.

We run a number of internal scenarios. We look at the applicable regulatory guidance. We look at where we think the rating agencies expect us to operate. We look at our maturities coverage, and we use all of those inputs to kind of size the liquidity that we hold. And then in 2015, what you saw us do is we used anything based on those inputs, anything that we felt was truly access liquidity. We use that to prepay the bank loan and we paid off obviously the GE Capital loan entirely so as we look at the higher cost of debt and what can we prepay and hopefully benefit the margin. And we're going to continue to do that. I just don't think -- I think the improvement to expect there is going to be more around the margins rather than a step change in 2016. The other thing I'd point out is I do think there is probably a longer-term opportunity as we get a little more experience on our deposit platform and the only thing you have to remember is we acquired the deposit platform in January 2013. So we have a relatively limited set of data on the deposit platform. As we start to grow that business and we start to see how the consumer behaves, our deposit customer behaves, that will give us a little more comfort in bringing down the overall liquidity. So I think there is probably a longer-term opportunity. I just don't think you're going to see a step change in 2016."

You've got a benefit from liquidity, a benefit from deposit growth and a slight benefit on interest rates if the Fed continues to tighten. And then I think you've got some offsets on growth and promotional balances and then a just generally higher payment rate across the portfolio as consumers continue to get more cautious. So again we were at 15.77 for the year. We said about 15.5 for 2016. We've tried to take all of that on our account as part of that guidance."

We only built the reserve 8%, so there's an implied benefit that we received in 2015.

So we're certainly getting much more engagement from the consumers on the mobile phone. And then we go through servicing, your ability to increase your credit line while you're standing at the store. Those are the kinds of things that are really important for us. The last piece of payment, which honestly, I think all of us reading this, that's turned out to be slower than what people I think thought. We're in all the walls that we possibly can be in and we'll continue that strategy. I just think this is -- mobile and line is the way people are shopping now. We just have to continually work to embed our credit application into the application of the retail. And that's really a lot of what we're going to be working on in 2016.

And this is information and data we're really trying to pull together to really help our partners think through how they're even marketing to their customers, right? So for instance, if we know someone shops multichannel, meaning online mobile and in-store, we have a very loyal customer and someone who tends to shop more often and their baskets will be bigger and they'll make more trips. So we want to make sure we're marketing to customers that way. So if we only use mobile, we know that.

We were honored to have our stock added to the S&P 500 Index upon consummation of the exchange offer. This is a testament to our strong position among leading financial services companies.
During the call today, I will first provide a review of the fourth quarter. Brian will then give more details on our financial results and outline our 2016 outlook. Finally, I will conclude with the overview of our strategic priorities.
I'll begin on Slide 3. Fourth quarter net earnings totaled $547 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Overall strong momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong purchase volume, receivables and platform revenue growth for this quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 8%, with holiday sales supporting this strong growth. Online and mobile sales volume was a key component of our holiday sales.
Our online and mobile sales growth steadily accelerated throughout last year, with fourth quarter sales growing 23% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which have been in the 14% to 15% range.
We delivered another quarter of strong receivables growth. Loan receivables were up 11%, and platform revenue grew 5%. Asset quality strengthened as demonstrated by a 9 basis point decline in our net charge-off rate and an 8 basis point improvement in 30-plus day delinquencies.
Expenses were in line with our expectations, with the increase being largely driven by investments we made in support of growth initiative as well as the infrastructure build associated with our establishment as a stand-alone company.
Deposit growth continued at a very strong pace, with deposits increasing $8 billion or 24% to $43 billion. Deposits now comprise 64% of our funding sources, squarely in line with our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results.
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. And we plan on launching new product offerings later this year to grow and further boost the retention of our deposit base.
Our balance sheet remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.8%, calculated on a transitional basis, and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end. During this time of transition, we remained very focused on driving business momentum. During the fourth quarter alone, we renewed several key relationships, including DICK's Sporting Goods, Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring. We also launched 2 of our recent wins with Newegg and Stash Hotel Rewards. We are enthusiastic about the prospects for these relationships and our ability to continue delivering significant value to these programs. Driving organic growth remains a key opportunity, and we rigorously pursue initiative to promote card usage and deepen penetration across all our partnerships.
Given the rapid pace of change within the digital payments area, online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business, and we are seizing the opportunities that are being presented to us by the swiftly changing environment. Through our innovation and strategic partnership, we are helping to shape the future of how private label card function in mobile log and provide value to our merchants and their consumers across mobile channels.
This quarter, we launched to 2 mobile applications that leverage innovative technology to provide enhanced functionality across our mobile product suite. Both of these efforts build upon collaboration with our strategic partner, GPShopper, a leader in integrated mobile platforms among retail clients. First, we launched the CareCredit mobile application. This app, available in the Apple Store and Google Play, enables millions of CareCredit cardholders convenient access to account servicing options. It includes the ability to locate health care providers and health-focused merchants, which can facilitate the connection across CareCredit's more than 195,000 total merchant locations. The app also features access to a digital card and offers a variety of value-added notifications and updates. We already have seen more than 700,000 visits to date. 
We also launched the CarCareONE mobile app, which readily connects millions of CarCareONE cardholders to more than 23,000 automotive-related merchants nationwide. Users can quickly and easily access account servicing, a location finder and office such as special financing on their smartphones. We also launched the pilot with JCPenney to offer their private-label credit cards in Apple Pay.
We continue to seek ways to increase the utility of our cards and their usage. Mobile applications are one of the ways we can readily connect cardholders and partners. In doing so, we improve the experience for the cardholder, help to increase engagement and ultimately drive more purchase volume.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 5%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 5% over the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing and marketing offers that will resonate with our partners and customers.
On the next slide, I'll discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail. We continued to deliver solid performance across all 3 of our sales platforms in the fourth quarter. Retail Card generated strong performance this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 8%, and receivables grew 12%. The addition of BP in the second quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 5%. As you may recall, there was a $46 million gain on sale of portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewing and extending our program remain a key priority in this business, and our success on this front is a testament to the strength and depth of our partnerships. This quarter, we renewed our long-standing relationship with DICK's Sporting Goods, a key partner. With this extension, we have nearly 92% of our Retail Card receivables on the contract to 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for future growth.
Payment Solutions delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 9%, and receivables grew 12%, driving platform revenue growth of 7%. Average active accounts increased 11% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We were very pleased to have extended our long-term relationship with Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring this quarter.
CareCredit had a solid quarter. Purchase volume growth was 9%, and receivables grew 7%, driving platform revenue growth of 3%. Average active accounts increased 6% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was once again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. In terms of business developments, we announced that Rite Aid is now accepting our CareCredit cards for prescription and general merchandise purchases in all 4,600 Rite Aid stores in the United States. CareCredit also announced the expansion of the patient financing agreement with National Vision, one of the largest optical retails in the U.S., with over 800 locations across 43 states.
In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continued to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for 2016."

In the fourth quarter, the business earned $547 million of net income, which translates to $0.65 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and platform revenue up 5%. Overall, we are pleased with the growth we generated across the business in 2015. The value propositions on our cards continued to resonate with consumers. The business delivered growth in average active accounts as well as increases in purchase volume and the average balance per active account compared to last year.
We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter, so that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year.
Platform revenue included a $46 million gain on sale of the portfolios in the fourth quarter of last year. And excluding the gain, platform revenue growth was 7%. Net interest income was up 8% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables.
RSAs were up $36 million or 5% compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were slightly under 4.5% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. On a full year basis, RSAs were 4.4% of average receivables in 2015 compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due to programs we exited last year where we paid a higher RSA as a percentage of average receivables as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. The RSA percentage on a full year basis has been relatively stable around 4.5% for the past 3 years.
The provision increased $26 million or 3% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth, partially offset by the improvement in asset quality. The improvement in asset quality is reflected in lower 30-plus delinquencies, which improved 8 basis points versus last year to 4.06%, and then the net charge-off rate which fell to 4.23%, 9 basis points below last year. 
Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was down 16 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year to 5.12%. However, measured against the last 4 quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3x. This is consistent with the coverage level over the past 4 quarters, which has been in the 1.2 to 1.3x range. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable.
Other income decreased $75 million versus last year, primarily driven by the $46 million gain on portfolio sales last year but also higher loyalty and rewards costs, partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $27 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $34 million, primarily driven by new value propositions.
As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to our RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.
Debt cancellation fees of $62 million were down $5 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel.
Other expenses increased $78 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to the infrastructure build that is now in the expense run rate, the majority of the increase was driven by growth and strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities.
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 34% and 33.5% year-to-date, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. And I'll cover the expense trend in more detail later.
Overall, we had strong top line growth and drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.6%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and go to our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 8%, driven by loan receivable growth. The net interest margin was 15.73% for the fourth quarter, 13 basis points higher than last year. As we had expected and noted on our third quarter earnings call, the margin experienced a seasonal decline from the third quarter due to the buildup in receivables. However, the margin was above the guidance of 15% to 15.5% we set out back in January.
As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. While the yield on receivables was relatively stable at 21.2%, we did see a slight improvement in interest-earning asset yields as we carried a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average for the quarter.
Cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.8% due to a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan facility and the payoff of the GE Capital loan, which offset the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance.
Our deposit base increased by over $8 billion or 24% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we've made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 64% of our funding versus 56% last year. And while the fourth quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which exceeded our guidance for the year.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.06%, down 8 basis points versus last year. 90-plus delinquencies were 1.86%, down 4 basis points. We continue to believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends compared to last year.
The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.23%, down 9 basis points versus last year.
Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.12%, which was down 16 basis points from the prior year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we're currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5-month loss coverage in our reserve. As I noted earlier, this is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of the portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses continued to be in line, and we delivered on our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Expenses came in at $870 million for the quarter, and compared to last year, are largely driven by separation-related costs, growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities.
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $58 million as we've added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were up $26 million, driven primarily by growth. Marketing and business development costs were down $37 million. The decrease was attributable to lower spend on brand advertising and marketing associated with our direct deposit products. As you may recall, last year, we did a major brand advertising campaign following our IPO. Also, given the strong growth in deposits, we were able to dial back some of our deposit-related marketing spend in the quarter.
Information processing was up $23 million, driven by higher IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year.
The efficiency ratio was 34% for the quarter as seasonally driven expenses tend to peak in the fourth quarter. The ratio was 33.5% for 2015, in line with our expectation of below 34% for the year.
Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 64% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. And while we have now moved further within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth on our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay.
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $13 billion to $15 billion range, which is approximately 20% of our funding. This is consistent with our approach to maintaining securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding.
Our third-party debt, bank term loans and senior unsecured notes totaled 16% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business compared to deposits and other lower-cost funding sources. We have continued to pay this down, making a $500 million prepayment in early December, and we also made a $1 billion prepayment in early January that will be reflected in the first quarter outstanding balance.
Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $3.2 billion currently, and we expect to continue to pay this down in future quarters. We also expect to continue issuing unsecured bonds, and we issued $1 billion 3-year fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in December. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility.
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 16.8% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 15.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 14.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 140 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $20.9 billion and includes $14.8 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LTR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LTR levels. Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.
Next, on Slide 11, I'll recap our 2015 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our growth of 11% exceeded our outlook range of 6% to 8%. The growth in 2015 was driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth as well as the addition of BP and other program wins. Net interest margin was 15.8% for the year, which is better than the 15% to 15.5% range we provided back in January. We have continued to look for ways to deploy excess liquidity generated from strong deposit growth, taking the opportunity to pay down higher-cost funding sources.
Our net charge-off rate was slightly better than we expected, with net charge-offs improving 18 basis points. We attribute this to our improved credit profile as well as the improving economic environment and likely some benefit from lower gas prices.
The efficiency ratio for the year was 33.5%, which was in line with our guidance of below 34% for the year. Despite the investment we made to build our stand-alone infrastructure, our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry. We feel well positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. And lastly, we generated return on assets of 2.9%, which was at the upper end of our guidance for 2015. So overall, we were pleased with the results of our financial performance in 2015.
Moving to our 2016 outlook on Slide 12. Our macro assumptions for 2016 are consistent with the consensus' views on forward rates and unemployment. Our framework assumes the Fed tightens 50 basis points this year and a stable to slightly improving unemployment rate.
Our guidance for receivable growth is in the 7% to 9% range. We expect we will continue to grow sales volume at 2 to 3x broader retail sales. This guidance doesn't assume any significant new portfolio acquisition.
We believe our margin will be in the 15.5% range this year. If rates do increase during the year, we expect our neutral to slightly asset-sensitive position would provide a small benefit to our net interest income.
In terms of our funding plan more broadly, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect to move towards the higher end of our target of 60% to 70% deposit funding in 2016.
We will also continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and we'll use the proceeds to continue to pay down the bank term loan well in advance of the contractual maturity in 2019.
In terms of credit, given the view that unemployment will be stable to slightly improving this year and our plan not to change our underwriting profile, we believe our net charge-off rate will continue to be relatively stable in the 4.3% to 4.5% range we experienced in 2014 and 2015. And while we expect net charge-offs to be stable, we do not believe the benefit we received in our reserve build in 2015 will repeat, and reserve post in 2016 will be more in line with receivables growth.
Moving to the efficiency ratio. We continue to plan on running the business with an efficiency ratio below 34% on a full year basis in 2016. Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry, and we feel well positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term.
Finally, we continue to expect to generate a return on assets in the 2.5% to 3% range in 2016, consistent with our guidance for 2015.
Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2016. As I've stated in the past, although we are not subject to CCAR, we are planning to follow a very similar process. We will use the Fed's CCAR assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that we'll review with our board and our regulators in early April and hope to hear back from the Fed in June. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, our plans will include both dividends and share buybacks.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

First, we remain focused on driving growth both organically and through new program wins across our 3 platforms. We have historically produced organic growth of 2 to 3x market growth rates, and we expect to continue to deliver similar growth. Innovative value propositions and enhanced functionality and utility for card users are some of the ways in which we will accomplish this. For example, we rolled out several compelling value propositions. Innovative programs like these and network expansions such as the one we initiated with Rite Aid for our CareCredit cards helped increase penetration. We also won our 20 new deals last year, and the pipeline remained strong. We have a demonstrated track record of success that we plan to continue to leverage this year and beyond as we seek to add new partners and programs with an attractive risk and return profile.
Second, we will continue to expand our robust data, analytics and technology offerings. We will continue our mobile app development for private-label credit cards such as the pilot with JCPenney and Apple Pay. Our digital strategies have helped drive an increase in online and mobile purchase volume at a faster pace than the national growth rate. We are focused on leveraging our leading capabilities as the digital landscape evolves. We are expanding our robust data and analytics capabilities through investments in Big Data technologies and insight tools such as data visualization software. Our partners highly value the insights we bring and the impact it has on their programs.
Third, we will continue to position our business for long-term growth. We will focus on building our Synchrony Bank franchise into a full-scale online bank through the development of a broad product suite to increase loyalty, diversify our funding sources and drive profitability. During 2015, we grew deposit a strong 24%. We will also leverage and explore adjacencies to our core business for growth opportunities such as expanding our small business platform.
Fourth, we will continue operating our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong liquidity and capital to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets. We intend to maintain earnings growth at attractive returns while demonstrating operating leverage.
Finally, we are highly focused on positioning the business to return capital to shareholders. And now that we are fully separated from GE, we will look to return capital this year through the establishment of a dividend and share repurchase program, subject to board and regulatory approval. We believe these are the right areas of focus and plan to leverage our prior success to pave the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress.
I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

So the way that we're thinking about it and similar to what we have said in the past is we're going to follow -- even though we're not technically subject to the CCAR process, we're going to follow a similar process and time line.

We're going to review a capital plan that includes both dividend and share repurchase. We'll review it with the risk committee, with the board. And then we'll review it with our regulators. We'll probably do that around the April time frame. And then similar to the other banks, we would expect to hear back and have some clarity around June. So that's how we're thinking about it. So we're optimistic that we can get something done hopefully in the second half of the year. And in terms of the absolute magnitude of return, we really need to go through the process. So we're just not in a position to be very specific at this point. But as we said in the past, we're going to be very thoughtful around the first half. It's more important for us to get a dividend and share repurchase established than it is to be very aggressive first time out."

I think the other thing that you've got to keep in mind as you think about our capital return is we are growing our risk-weighted assets faster than most of the peer set. So if you just assume -- let's just take the midpoint of our guidance, 8% RWA growth, we would need to retain roughly 35% of our earnings to support growth and keep the capital ratios flat.

So this isn't a significant change from our perspective, from how we've been trending. In terms of how to think about the margin for 2016, I think there's a few puts and takes. Obviously, we will see slight benefits, we think, from deposit growth and interest rates. As I mentioned earlier, we built in 2 more kind of rounds of tightening 50 basis points for the year. We'll get a slight benefit from that. But then we also expect to see some slight offsets for growth and promotional balances. We saw that in 2015. Payment solutions growth continues to outpace the other platforms, and those balances come on initially at a lower yield. And we did see higher payment rates more broadly across the portfolio in 2015. So we try to account for all of that, and the guidance of about 15.5% feels right for 2016."

So if you're looking at the ROA and you're -- if you're building off at 2015, the one thing to think about is the reserve build, which I mentioned earlier on the call. So we did receive a fairly significant benefit in the reserve build from improved performance, particularly in the first half. So in the first quarter, we only posted $19 million of reserves. We posted $47 million in the second quarter. So while we were building reserves, we were getting a fairly significant offset in the first half. And given we expect credit to stabilize from here, we'd expect to see a higher reserve build in the first half of 2016, so more in line with our receivables growth. And so if you take that back to ROA, we'd expect to start the year closer to the midpoint of the range. And then similar to what you saw this year in the second half, it usually ticks up a bit in the third quarter, and that's where we hit that seasonal low on charge-offs, and then it typically ticks down a bit in the fourth quarter with the higher marketing spend and the seasonal charge-offs. So I think that gives you a good way to think about it for the year."

So as you mentioned, expenses were up 10% compared to the fourth quarter last year. In the quarter, we did have $22 million of compensation-related payments that were tied to the exchange offer in the quarter. So if you adjust for that, expenses were up 7%, so more in line with growth. And the expense growth, the 7% growth, was really largely driven by the investments we're making in long-term growth of the business as well as active accounts were up, obviously, receivables up, et cetera. As you think about 2016, we gave you very similar guidance on the efficiency ratio of below 34%. Maybe I'll just spend a minute describing how we think about it. First, I'd say we're very focused on driving productivity and operating leverage across the business. We'll continue to get more efficient across the business. We always start the year with a slew of productivity initiatives. We're driving things like moving more customers to e-statements and off of paper. We're improving the efficiency of our call center and collections teams. And we're also -- we're always trying to simplify and reduce the back office and IT systems. Okay. And then we take those savings, and we make investments that we believe are going to drive the long-term growth of our business. So we're investing in things like mobile, data analytics, CRM. And so we're very focused on driving operating leverage, but we're not so wed to the efficiency ratio that we're going to stop investing in these long-term growth areas."

It's part of the reason why you see purchase volume and platform revenue lagging the receivables growth a bit. If you adjust purchase volume for day count, it would move from 8% to 10% growth. And then on platform revenue, this also stands out a bit. If you adjust for the $46 million gain on sale that we had in the fourth quarter of last year and the fact that we had 2 less days this quarter, revenue was up 9%, which is more in line with receivables growth."

What I would say on in terms of portfolio itself and the impact on delinquencies in the oil and gas areas, obviously, we watch that. We're not really seeing too much of a shift there. Our portfolio is pretty much a very big macro look at the overall economy. So we're spread out across the whole entire United States. So we watch those things, but we're not seeing a big impact there.

So we look at our higher-cost forms of debt and we say, ""Okay, what can we prepay and hopefully benefit the margin?"" And we're going to continue to do that. I just don't think -- I think the improvement to expect there is going to be more around the margins rather than a step change in 2016. The other thing I'd point out is I do think there is probably a longer-term opportunity as we get a little more experience with our deposit platform. And the only thing you have to remember is we acquired the deposit platform in January 2013. So we have a relatively limited set of data on the deposit platform. As we start to grow that business and we start to see how the consumer behaves, our deposit customer behaves, that will give us a little more comfort in bringing down the overall liquidity. So I think there is probably a longer-term opportunity. I just don't think you're going to see a step change in 2016."

The way we approach mobile is really through the whole process. So we look at applications. So one of the benefits we have is you can apply on your mobile phone and get approved and start shopping. Now that's a big opportunity for us there. So if you look at just our growth in mobile applications year-over-year, it was 73%. So we're certainly getting much more engagement from the consumers on the mobile phone. And then we go through servicing, your ability to increase your credit line while you're standing in the store. Those are the kinds of things that are really important for us. The last piece is payment, which, honestly, I think all of us reading this, that's turned out to be slower than what people, I think, thought. We're in all the walls that we possibly can be in, and we'll continue that strategy. I just think this is -- mobile and online is the way people are shopping now. We have to just continually work to embed our credit application into the application of the retail. And that's really a lot of what we're going to be working on in 2016. So our view is this is where the industry is going or the consumer is going, and we need to be in the forefront of that."

We can actually see how the customer is shopping. So we know they made a purchase on their mobile phone or they made a purchase online or they were in the store. And this is information and data we're really trying to pull together to really help our partners think through how they're even marketing to their customers, right. So for instance, if we know someone shops multichannel, meaning online, mobile and in-store, we have a very loyal customer and someone who tends to shop more often, and their baskets will be bigger and they'll make more trips. So we want to make sure we're marketing to customers that way. So if you only use mobile, we know that. We'll market to you only using mobile or digital kinds of marketing versus someone who's maybe only shopping at the point of sale. So I think as we continue to expand our data analytics, this will become, I think, an even more critical asset of how we help our partners."

We were honored to have our stock added to the S&P 500 Index upon consummation of the exchange offer. This is a testament to our strong position among leading financial services companies.
During the call today, I will first provide a review of the fourth quarter. Brian will then give more details on our financial results and outline our 2016 outlook. Finally, I will conclude with the overview of our strategic priorities.
I'll begin on Slide 3. Fourth quarter net earnings totaled $547 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Overall strong momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong purchase volume, receivables and platform revenue growth for this quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 8%, with holiday sales supporting this strong growth. Online and mobile sales volume was a key component of our holiday sales.
Our online and mobile sales growth steadily accelerated throughout last year, with fourth quarter sales growing 23% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which have been in the 14% to 15% range.
We delivered another quarter of strong receivables growth. Loan receivables were up 11%, and platform revenue grew 5%. Asset quality strengthened as demonstrated by a 9 basis point decline in our net charge-off rate and an 8 basis point improvement in 30-plus day delinquencies.
Expenses were in line with our expectations, with the increase being largely driven by investments we made in support of growth initiatives as well as the infrastructure build associated with our establishment as a stand-alone company.
Deposit growth continued at a very strong pace, with deposits increasing $8 billion or 24% to $43 billion. Deposits now comprise 64% of our funding sources, squarely in line with our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results.
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. And we plan on launching new product offerings later this year to grow and further boost the retention of our deposit base.
Our balance sheet remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.8%, calculated on a transitional basis, and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end. During this time of transition, we remained very focused on driving business momentum. During the fourth quarter alone, we renewed several key relationships, including DICK's Sporting Goods, Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring. We also launched 2 of our recent wins with Newegg and Stash Hotel Rewards. We are enthusiastic about the prospects for these relationships and our ability to continue delivering significant value to these programs. Driving organic growth remains a key opportunity, and we rigorously pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration across all our partnerships.
Given the rapid pace of change within the digital payments area, online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business, and we are seizing the opportunities that are being presented to us by the swiftly changing environment. Through our innovation and strategic partnership, we are helping to shape the future of how private label cards function in mobile walls [ph] and provide value to our merchants and their consumers across mobile channels.
This quarter, we launched to 2 mobile applications that leverage innovative technology to provide enhanced functionality across our mobile product suite. Both of these efforts build upon collaboration with our strategic partner, GPShopper, a leader in integrated mobile platforms among retail clients. First, we launched the CareCredit mobile application. This app, available in the Apple Store and Google Play, enables millions of CareCredit cardholders convenient access to account servicing options. It includes the ability to locate health care providers and health-focused merchants, which can facilitate the connection across CareCredit's more than 195,000 total merchant locations. The app also features access to a digital card and offers a variety of value-added notifications and updates. We already have seen more than 700,000 visits to date. 
We also launched the CarCareONE mobile app, which readily connects millions of CarCareONE cardholders to more than 23,000 automotive-related merchants nationwide. Users can quickly and easily access account servicing, a location finder and offers such as special financing on their smartphones. We also launched the pilot with JCPenney to offer their private-label credit cards in Apple Pay.
We continue to seek ways to increase the utility of our cards and their usage. Mobile applications are one of the ways we can readily connect cardholders and partners. In doing so, we improve the experience for the cardholder, help to increase engagement and ultimately drive more purchase volume.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 5%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 5% over the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing and marketing offers that will resonate with our partners and customers.
On the next slide, I'll discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail. We continued to deliver solid performance across all 3 of our sales platforms in the fourth quarter. Retail Card generated strong performance this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 8%, and receivables grew 12%. The addition of BP in the second quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 5%. As you may recall, there was a $46 million gain on sale of portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewing and extending our program remain a key priority in this business, and our success on this front is a testament to the strength and depth of our partnerships. This quarter, we renewed our long-standing relationship with DICK's Sporting Goods, a key partner. With this extension, we have nearly 92% of our Retail Card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for future growth.
Payment Solutions delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 9%, and receivables grew 12%, driving platform revenue growth of 7%. Average active accounts increased 11% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volumes and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We were very pleased to have extended our long-term relationship with Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring this quarter.
CareCredit had a solid quarter. Purchase volume growth was 9%, and receivables grew 7%, driving platform revenue growth of 3%. Average active accounts increased 6% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was once again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. In terms of business developments, we announced that Rite Aid is now accepting our CareCredit cards for prescriptions and general merchandise purchases in all 4,600 Rite Aid stores in the United States. CareCredit also announced the expansion of the patient financing agreement with National Vision, one of the largest optical retails in the U.S., with over 800 locations across 43 states.
In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continued to make progress on the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for 2016."

We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and platform revenue up 5%. Overall, we are pleased with the growth we generated across the business in 2015. The value propositions on our cards continued to resonate with consumers. The business delivered growth in average active accounts as well as increases in purchase volume and the average balance per active account compared to last year.
We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter, so that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year.
Platform revenue included a $46 million gain on sale of the portfolios in the fourth quarter of last year. And excluding the gain, platform revenue growth was 7%. Net interest income was up 8% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables.
RSAs were up $36 million or 5% compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were slightly under 4.5% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. On a full year basis, RSAs were 4.4% of average receivables in 2015 compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due to programs we exited last year where we paid a higher RSA as a percentage of average receivables as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. The RSA percentage on a full year basis has been relatively stable around 4.5% for the past 3 years.
The provision increased $26 million or 3% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth, partially offset by the improvement in asset quality. The improvement in asset quality is reflected in lower 30-plus delinquencies, which improved 8 basis points versus last year to 4.06%, and in the net charge-off rate which fell to 4.23%, 9 basis points below last year. 
Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was down 16 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year to 5.12%. However, measured against the last 4 quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3x. This is consistent with the coverage level over the past 4 quarters, which has been in the 1.2 to 1.3x range. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable.
Other income decreased $75 million versus last year, primarily driven by the $46 million gain on portfolio sales last year but also higher loyalty and rewards costs, partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $27 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $34 million, primarily driven by new value propositions.
As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through our RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.
Debt cancellation fees of $62 million were down $5 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel.
Other expenses increased $78 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to the infrastructure build that is now in the expense run rate, the majority of the increase was driven by growth and strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities.
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 34% and 33.5% year-to-date, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. And I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later.
Overall, we had strong top line growth and drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.6%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and go through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 8%, driven by loan receivable growth. The net interest margin was 15.73% for the fourth quarter, 13 basis points higher than last year. As we had expected and noted on our third quarter earnings call, the margin experienced a seasonal decline from the third quarter due to the buildup in receivables. However, the margin was above the guidance of 15% to 15.5% we set out back in January.
As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. While the yield on receivables was relatively stable at 21.2%, we did see a slight improvement in interest-earning asset yields as we carried a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average for the quarter.
Cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.8% due to a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan facility and the payoff of the GE Capital loan, which offset the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance.
Our deposit base increased by over $8 billion or 24% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we've made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 64% of our funding versus 56% last year. And while the fourth quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which exceeded our guidance for the year.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.06%, down 8 basis points versus last year. 90-plus delinquencies were 1.86%, down 4 basis points. We continue to believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends compared to last year.
The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.23%, down 9 basis points versus last year.
Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.12%, which was down 16 basis points from the prior year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we're currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5-month loss coverage in our reserve. As I noted earlier, this is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of the portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses continued to be in line, and we delivered on our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Expenses came in at $870 million for the quarter, and compared to last year, are largely driven by separation-related costs, growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities.
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $58 million as we've added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were up $26 million, driven primarily by growth. Marketing and business development costs were down $37 million. The decrease was attributable to lower spend on brand advertising and marketing associated with our direct deposit products. As you may recall, last year, we did a major brand advertising campaign following our IPO. Also, given the strong growth in deposits, we were able to dial back some of our deposit-related marketing spend in the quarter.
Information processing was up $23 million, driven by higher IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year.
The efficiency ratio was 34% for the quarter as seasonally driven expenses tend to peak in the fourth quarter. The ratio was 33.5% for 2015, in line with our expectation of below 34% for the year.
Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 64% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. And while we have now moved further within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay.
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $13 billion to $15 billion range, which is approximately 20% of our funding. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding.
Our third-party debt, bank term loans and senior unsecured notes totaled 16% of our funding sources. As we've said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business compared to deposits and other lower-cost funding sources. We have continued to pay this down, making a $500 million prepayment in early December, and we also made a $1 billion prepayment in early January that will be reflected in the first quarter outstanding balance.
Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $3.2 billion currently, and we expect to continue to pay this down in future quarters. We also expect to continue issuing unsecured bonds, and we issued $1 billion 3-year fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in December. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility.
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 16.8% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 15.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 14.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 140 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $20.9 billion and includes $14.8 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.
Next, on Slide 11, I'll recap our 2015 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our growth of 11% exceeded our outlook range of 6% to 8%. The growth in 2015 was driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth as well as the addition of BP and other program wins. Net interest margin was 15.8% for the year, which is better than the 15% to 15.5% range we provided back in January. We have continued to look for ways to deploy excess liquidity generated from strong deposit growth, taking the opportunity to pay down higher-cost funding sources.
Our net charge-off rate was slightly better than we expected, with net charge-offs improving 18 basis points. We attribute this to our improved credit profile as well as the improving economic environment and likely some benefit from lower gas prices.
The efficiency ratio for the year was 33.5%, which was in line with our guidance of below 34% for the year. Despite the investment we made to build our stand-alone infrastructure, our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry. We feel well positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.9%, which was at the upper end of our guidance for 2015. So overall, we were pleased with the results of our financial performance in 2015.
Moving to our 2016 outlook on Slide 12. Our macro assumptions for 2016 are consistent with the consensus' views on forward rates and unemployment. Our framework assumes the Fed tightens 50 basis points this year and a stable to slightly improving unemployment rate.
Our guidance for receivable growth is in the 7% to 9% range. We expect we will continue to grow sales volume at 2 to 3x broader retail sales. This guidance doesn't assume any significant new portfolio acquisitions.
We believe our margin will be in the 15.5% range this year. If rates do increase during the year, we expect our neutral to slightly asset-sensitive position would provide a small benefit to our net interest income.
In terms of our funding plan more broadly, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect to move towards the higher end of our target of 60% to 70% deposit funding in 2016.
We will also continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and we'll use the proceeds to continue to pay down the bank term loan well in advance of the contractual maturity in 2019.
In terms of credit, given the view that unemployment will be stable to slightly improving this year and our plan not to change our underwriting profile, we believe our net charge-off rate will continue to be relatively stable in the 4.3% to 4.5% range we experienced in 2014 and 2015. And while we expect net charge-offs to be stable, we do not believe the benefit we received in our reserve build in 2015 will repeat, and reserve posts in 2016 will be more in line with receivables growth.
Moving to the efficiency ratio. We continue to plan on running the business with an efficiency ratio below 34% on a full year basis in 2016. Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry, and we feel well positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term.
Finally, we continue to expect to generate a return on assets in the 2.5% to 3% range in 2016, consistent with our guidance for 2015.
Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2016. As I've stated in the past, although we are not subject to CCAR, we are planning to follow a very similar process. We will use the Fed's CCAR assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that we'll review with our board and our regulators in early April and hope to hear back from the Fed in June. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, our plans will include both dividends and share buybacks.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

First, we remain focused on driving growth both organically and through new program wins across our 3 platforms. We have historically produced organic growth of 2 to 3x market growth rates, and we expect to continue to deliver similar growth. Innovative value propositions and enhanced functionality and utility for card users are some of the ways in which we will accomplish this. For example, we rolled out several compelling value propositions. Innovative programs like these and network expansions such as the one we initiated with Rite Aid for our CareCredit cards helped increase penetration. We also won over 20 new deals last year, and the pipeline remains strong. We have a demonstrated track record of success that we plan to continue to leverage this year and beyond as we seek to add new partners and programs with an attractive risk and return profile.
Second, we will continue to expand our robust data, analytics and technology offerings. We will continue our mobile wall [ph] development for private-label credit cards such as the pilot with JCPenney and Apple Pay. Our digital strategies have helped drive an increase in online and mobile purchase volume at a faster pace than the national growth rate. We are focused on leveraging our leading capabilities as the digital landscape evolves. We are expanding our robust data and analytics capabilities through investments in Big Data technologies and insight tools such as data visualization software. Our partners highly value the insights we bring and the impact it has on their programs.
Third, we will continue to position our business for long-term growth. We will focus on building our Synchrony Bank franchise into a full-scale online bank through the development of a broad product suite to increase loyalty, diversify our funding sources and drive profitability. During 2015, we grew deposits a strong 24%. We will also leverage and explore adjacencies to our core business for growth opportunities such as expanding our small business platform.
Fourth, we will continue operating our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong liquidity and capital to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets. We intend to maintain earnings growth at attractive returns while demonstrating operating leverage.
Finally, we are highly focused on positioning the business to return capital to shareholders. And now that we are fully separated from GE, we will look to return capital this year through the establishment of a dividend and share repurchase program, subject to board and regulatory approval. We believe these are the right areas of focus and plan to leverage our prior success to pave the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress.
I'll now turn the call over to Greg."

We're going to review a capital plan that includes both dividend and share repurchase. We'll review it with the risk committee, with the board. And then we'll review it with our regulators. We'll probably do that around the April time frame. And then similar to the other banks, we would expect to hear back and have some clarity around June. So that's how we're thinking about it. So we're optimistic that we can get something done hopefully in the second half of the year. And in terms of the absolute magnitude of the return, we really need to go through the process. So we're just not in a position to be very specific at this point. But as we've said in the past, we're going to be very thoughtful around the first ask.

I think the other thing that you've got to keep in mind as you think about our capital return is we are growing our risk-weighted assets faster than most of the peer set. So if you just assume -- let's just take the midpoint of our guidance, 8% RWA growth, we would need to retain roughly 35% of our earnings to support growth and keep the capital ratios flat. So over the long term, anything over a 65% payout ratio would then start to bring our capital ratios down more in line with peers."

So this isn't a significant change from our perspective, from how we've been trending. In terms of how to think about the margin for 2016, I think there's a few puts and takes. Obviously, we will see slight benefits, we think, from deposit growth and interest rates. As I mentioned earlier, we built in 2 more kind of rounds of tightening, 50 basis points for the year. We'll get a slight benefit from that. But then we also expect to see some slight offsets for growth in promotional balances. We saw that in 2015. Payment solutions growth continues to outpace the other platforms, and those balances come on initially at a lower yield. And then we did see higher payment rates more broadly across the portfolio in 2015. So we've tried to account for all of that and the guidance of about 15.5% feels right for 2016."

So if you're looking at the ROA and you're -- if you're building off a 2015, the one thing to think about is the reserve build, which I mentioned earlier on the call. So we did receive a fairly significant benefit in the reserve build from improved performance, particularly in the first half. So in the first quarter, we only posted $19 million of reserves. We posted $47 million in the second quarter. So while we were building reserves, we were getting a fairly significant offset in the first half. And given we expect credit to stabilize from here, we'd expect to see a higher reserve build in the first half of 2016, so more in line with our receivables growth. And so if you take that back to ROA, we'd expect to start the year closer to the midpoint of the range. And then similar to what you saw this year in the second half, it usually ticks up a bit in the third quarter. That's where we hit that seasonal low on charge-offs, and then it typically ticks down a bit in the fourth quarter with the higher marketing spend and the seasonal charge-offs. So I think that gives you a good way to think about it for the year."

So as you mentioned, expenses were up 10% compared to the fourth quarter last year. In the quarter, we did have $22 million of compensation-related payments that were tied to the exchange offer in the quarter.

And the expense growth, the 7% growth, was really largely driven by the investments we're making in long-term growth of the business as well as active accounts were up, obviously, receivables up, et cetera. As you think about 2016, we gave you very similar guidance on the efficiency ratio of below 34%. Maybe I'll just spend a minute describing how we think about it. First, I'd say we're very focused on driving productivity and operating leverage across the business. We'll continue to get more efficient across the business. We always start the year with a slew of productivity initiatives. We're driving things like moving more customers to e-statements and off of paper. We're improving the efficiency of our call center and collections teams. And we're also -- we're always trying to simplify and reduce the back office and IT systems. Okay. But then we take those savings, and we make investments that we believe are going to drive the long-term growth of our business. So we're investing in things like mobile, data analytics, CRM. And so we're very focused on driving operating leverage, but we're not so wed to the efficiency ratio that we're going to stop investing in these long-term growth areas."

So in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had 94 days compared to 92 days this quarter. So this does impact some of the top line metrics. That's part of the reason why you see purchase volume and platform revenue lagging the receivables growth a bit. If you adjust purchase volume for day count, it would move from 8% to 10% growth. And then on platform revenue, this also stands out a bit. If you adjust for the $46 million gain on sale that we had in the fourth quarter last year and the fact that we had 2 less days this quarter, revenue was up 9%, which is more in line with receivables growth."

What I would say on -- in terms of the portfolio itself and the impact on delinquencies in the oil and gas areas, obviously, we watch that. We're not really seeing too much of a shift there. Our portfolio is pretty much a very big macro look at the overall economy. So we're spread out across the whole entire United States. So we watch those things, but we're not seeing a big impact there. And then lastly, we do have a couple of oil and gas portfolios, but they're less -- they are 3%, more or less, of our receivables, so not a big impact there either."

I'd say we've been in this business a very long time. We have winners and losers every single year.

So can you maybe talk a little bit about how your pipeline looks and how your data analytics capabilities are playing into your discussions with potential partners?

So what we really try to do is figure out ways to leverage the tools and things we have to help them accelerate their growth. So when we start with conversations, whether it's an existing portfolio or a new portfolio, it always starts with capabilities. And that's where we're pretty disciplined on the kind of partnerships we want because we think when you're adding value every single day and your partner is seeing that value that you're adding, that's how you're able to keep relationships long term. And then price becomes the second discussion. So that's what our job is. Our job every day for our folks out in the field, our folks who manage our partners, is to really have one foot in the partner, one foot in Synchrony and really ensure that they are driving sales and helping that partner every single day.

We run a number of internal scenarios. We look at the applicable regulatory guidance. We look at where we think the rating agencies expect us to operate. We look at our maturities coverage. And we use all of those inputs to kind of size the liquidity that we hold. And then in 2015, what you saw us do was use anything that -- based on all of those inputs, anything that we felt was truly excess liquidity, we used that to prepay the bank loan, and we paid off, obviously, the GE Capital loan entirely. So we look at our higher-cost forms of debt and we say, ""Okay, what can we prepay and hopefully benefit the margin?"" And we're going to continue to do that. I just don't think -- I think the improvement to expect there is going to be more around the margins rather than a step change in 2016. The other thing I'd point out is I do think there is probably a longer-term opportunity as we get a little more experience with our deposit platform. I mean, the other thing you have to remember is we acquired the deposit platform in January 2013. So we have a relatively limited set of data on the deposit platform. As we start to grow that business and we start to see how the consumer behaves, our deposit customer behaves, that will give us a little more comfort in bringing down the overall liquidity. So I think there is probably a longer-term opportunity. I just don't think you're going to see a step change in 2016."

So for instance, if we know someone shops multichannel, meaning online, mobile and in-store, we have a very loyal customer and someone who tends to shop more often, and their baskets will be bigger and they'll make more trips. So we want to make sure we're marketing to customers that way. So if you only use mobile, we know that. We'll market to you only using mobile or digital kinds of marketing versus someone who's maybe only shopping at the point of sale. So I think as we continue to expand our data analytics, this will become, I think, an even more critical asset of how we help our partners."

Yes, no, it sounds like you're able to capture more and basically provide more differentiated marketing services.

Many of those smaller retailers don't have a mobile application. So just bringing that partnership together and then us embedding our credit application within their mobile apps, that's where the partnership piece comes in. We can really take some of the learnings we have from our big retailer supply to the smaller retailers and help them get their product set, if you will, right on the mobile phone. So a lot of work going on that."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3. First quarter net earnings totaled $582 mil",1372,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3. 
First quarter net earnings totaled $582 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Overall, solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong double-digit growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and platform revenue this quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 17% and platform revenue and loan receivables grew 13%. We continue to see strong growth in our online and mobile purchase volume. Our online and mobile sales growth has been steadily accelerating and first quarter sales grew 29% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range. 
Asset quality metrics were relatively stable this quarter, in line with our expectations. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 3.85% and our net charge-off rate was 4.7% in the range of losses we have experienced in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 7% over last year. This was largely driven by investments we made in support of our growth initiatives. However, our overall efficiency ratio improved 1.8 percentage points to 30.4%, reflecting our strong revenue growth this quarter. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which grew $10 billion or 29% to $45 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 69% of our funding sources at the high end of our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results, and at this point, you can expect for us to grow a little beyond that original target range. 
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. We plan to launch new product offerings later this year, which will augment growth and enhance the retention of our deposit base. Given the significant growth in deposits, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5. We are pleased that we were able to pay off this loan well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.1%, calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter-end. 
We renewed several key relationships during the quarter, including Stein Mart and La-Z-Boy. We also signed a new partnership with Marvel and recently launched the Marvel MasterCard with an attractive cashback value proposition. We are further leveraging this relationship by developing creative ways to market our deposit products to the Marvel fan base. The new value proposition delivers the greatest benefit on leisure activities including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. Cardholders receive 3% cashback on spending in these types of categories and 1% cashback on other purchases. We are excited about this partnership and the value this new card will bring to loyal Marvel fans and others who enjoy the benefit of a cashback program. The partnership will also offer a unique opportunity to co-promote our deposit products in conjunction with the Marvel feature film. We launched a new campaign called, Save Like a Hero, which will feature Synchrony Bank saving products and be tied to the release of Marvel's new Captain America movie. This is the second starter program we have rolled out in the travel and entertainment space. You'll recall that last quarter, we also launched our Stash Hotel Rewards program. We think this is an area that provides attractive opportunities. 
During the quarter, we also launched our new Citgo card program. Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the 5,000-plus locally owned and operated Citgo locations in the United States. We continue to work with our partners, new and existing, to develop compelling value propositions for their cardholders. 
This quarter, we launched a new value prop with Walmart. The program brings even more value to the everyday purchases customers make using their Walmart cards. The 3-2-1 Save cashback program provides qualifying cardholders the opportunity to earn rewards for purchases they make every day including 3% back on purchases made on walmart.com, 2% back on fuel purchases at Walmart and Murphy USA gas stations and 1% back on purchases made at Walmart stores and everywhere that Walmart cards are accepted. The 3-2-1 Save program simplifies and strengthens the card proposition for Walmart cardholders. We work closely with Walmart to meet the evolving needs of their customers, and we are excited about this program as it also recognizes the increasing move to online and mobile shopping. It is the first credit card program designed to offer Walmart cardholders even greater savings on their online purchases. We are highly focused on innovating ways to drive organic growth as it remains a key priority and opportunity. We continue to work closely with our partners to deliver growth across all sales channels.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remains strong at 13%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 17% and average asset account growth of 7%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 13% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers that deliver value to our partners and customers. 
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver solid performance across all 3 of our sales platforms in the first quarter. Retail Card generated especially strong results this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 17% and receivables grew 14%. The addition of BP in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 15%. The strong growth in Retail Card was broad-based as we saw growth across our partner programs. 
As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter in Retail Card. We renewed and extended the Stein Mart program. We signed a new partnership with Marvel and launched the new Marvel MasterCard this month, and we launched the new value proposition with Walmart, the 3-2-1 Save cashback program. The position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 15% and receivables grew 13%, driving platform revenue growth of 14%. Average active accounts increased 12% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We renewed a key home furnishing relationship with the extension of our La-Z-Boy partnership. We continue to expand card use in Payment Solutions, with repeat purchase volume growing 18% year-over-year. Reuse represented 27% of purchase volume in the first quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Purchase volume was up 14% and receivables grew 9%, driving platform revenue growth of 6%. Average active accounts increased 7% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Card reuse continues to be an area of focus in CareCredit, and purchase volume from repeat usage on the card grew 17% compared to last year. Reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. 
Our CareCredit digital innovations continue to resonate with cardholders. The CareCredit app has been downloaded more than 350,000 times and visited more than 2.3 million times since we launched it last fall. In addition, our provider locator averaged more than 800,000 hits per month in the first quarter. 
In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the development, expansion and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."

I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter.

In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. This compares to $552 million or $0.66 per diluted share last year. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volumes up 17%, receivables up 13% and platform revenue up 13%. Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average spend, with purchase volume per average active account increasing 9% over last year as well as growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter last year, so that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year. 
Net interest income was up 12% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables. RSAs were up slightly, $10 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with growth in the programs as well as higher loyalty cost in our share through the RSA with our retailers. We typically see the RSA decline from the fourth quarter due to lower postholiday-related volume. We still expect the RSA benefit on a full year basis to trend slightly under 4.5%. The provision increased $216 million compared to last year. While the increase was driven by receivables growth, we also had the benefit of a lower reserve build last year due to improved asset quality metrics. I'll cover this in more in detail later.
Asset quality metrics were relatively stable. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% compared to 3.79% last year, and the net charge-off rate was 4.70% compared to 4.53% last year. Credit metrics were in line with our expectations and consistent with the range we have seen in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of our receivables was 5.5%. Measured against the last 4 quarters' net charge-offs, the reserve coverage is 1.3x, which is consistent with the coverage level over the past 6 quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were stable. 
Other income decreased $9 million versus last year. Higher loyalty rewards cost were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $30 million, driven by continued growth in our store spending in our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $32 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there's a partial offset on each of these items. 
Debt cancellation fees of $64 million were down $1 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now to our online channel. Other expenses increased $54 million or 7% versus last year, more in line with the growth of the business. Now that we are comparing the periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth as well as strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. 
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.4%. The first quarter is typically the low point for the efficiency ratio due to marketing, business development and volume related expenses being at their lowest level for the year. The efficiency ratio will normally increase from these levels in the remainder of the year. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our strong performance drove a solid quarter generating ROA of 2.8%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.76% for the quarter, relatively stable to last year in the prior quarter. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The yield on receivables declined 21 basis points to 21.1%, reflecting higher payment rates and a slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions, where the yield is lower than our overall portfolio yield. The decline in receivables yield was offset by a slight benefit from rates earn in our liquidity portfolio due to higher short-term benchmark rates resulting from the Fed tightening in December. We also benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan facility. 
The cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.9% due to an increase from rising short-term benchmark rates and the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance, which was largely offset by a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan and the payoff for the GE Capital loan last year. Our deposit base increased by over $10 billion or 29% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 69% of our funding versus 59% last year. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continue to see relatively stable asset quality performance, which was generally in line with our expectations. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% versus 3.79% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.84% compared to 1.81% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate was 4.7% compared to 4.53% in the first quarter last year. Both the delinquency metrics and net charge-off levels are consistent with the results in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015. We continue to believe the performance is being sustained due in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer driven the continued improvement in implement trends. 
Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%, down slightly from 5.59% last year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we're currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve, which is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $800 million for the quarter, a 7% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $41 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were down $16 million, driven primarily by lower third-party spend as a result of our completion of the separation from GE. Marketing and business development costs were up $12 million. The higher costs were driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume receivables. Information processing was up $19 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter due to seasonal low points in marketing, business development and volume-related expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year. However, we expect it to remain below 34% in line with what we communicated back in January. 
Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $10 billion primarily for our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 69% of our funding, which is near the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now move further towards the top end of our target leverage, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay. Given we are near the top end of our range and we expect to continue to drive deposit growth, we would expect deposits to move a little above 70% of our funding in the upcoming quarters. Longer term, once we reach our optimal mix of deposits, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivable growth. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion explained and is now 19% of our funding. In March, we successfully issued $750 million in 3-year notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization of between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loan and senior unsecured notes now total 12% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy was to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this would become a more expensive source of funding for the business as rates start to rise. Given the significant growth in deposits, we made $2.7 billion of prepayments in the quarter and paid off the remaining $1.5 billion in early April. We are pleased to have fully paid this loan up well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.1%, CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.4% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 110 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $22.2 billion and includes $14.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.3 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. 
I'd also like to provide an update on our capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the time line we've communicated on previous calls. 
Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

We continue to think that losses will be stable for the balance of the year. We've been pretty clear that we don't expect them to get better from here. I think that's pretty consistent across the industry. If you look at the performance in the quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. If you look at the year-over-year comparison, you have to remember that we had a really strong first quarter last year, which was -- frankly, is better than we expected. We only had a $19 [ph] million reserve build in the first quarter last year. So really what you're seeing now is more of a normalization and generally more in line with our expectations. So if you look at reserve coverage levels, they are also very consistent. Reserve coverage as a percent of our receivables was 5.5%. It was down just 9 basis points from last year. If you look at the reserve coverage against last 12 months' charge-offs, it was 1.29x versus 1.26x a year ago, so also very consistent. So I think for the balance of the year, we continue to see our losses will be stable, an overall change to that 2-year kind of average that we gave in January."

But the real growth is coming from organic growth and increased penetration. And throughout CareCredit 50% of the sales are repeat. And Payment Solutions, we're seeing nice repeat I think one of the key drivers of our results is really 2 things. One is the value props that we continue to enhance and drive into our retailers, and we work closely with them to really develop those value propositions. And going back to our financing about the consumer being stable in credit, I do think consumers continue to look for a reason to shop. So having very strong value propositions is really key. The second is really all the innovation we continue to do on mobile. Our online sales overall were up 29% year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a testament to the ability to apply and buy I think. And you combine that with the strong value propositions. I think this is why you're really seeing the kind of growth you're seeing. So I'd say most of it is through existing cardholders who are deepening their loyalty to the brand of that particular retailer. On the pipeline itself, our pipeline continues to remain robust. It's really a mix, I'd say, of startups as well as existing portfolios that we're looking to win. It's a combination of both. We have, as I said in the past, dedicated resources in all 3 platforms. We're working on our network, so in CareCredit being able to add RiteAid, things like that. So very focused on the front end on winning the deals and feeling we have a good pipeline going forward."

So I would say the trends have picked up a little bit from recent quarters primarily around active account growth. So the big thing for us relative to general purpose cards, we're always measuring active account, and that obviously includes new accounts. Active accounts are more important for us because we're trying to create those incentives for cardholders to use the card more often. We want to create value propositions that push our card more towards the top of wallet. And so if you look at purchase volume growth, about half of that came from higher spend per active account. That was up about 8.5% from the prior year, and then the other half came from an increase in overall active accounts, up 7.5%. So a lot of what we're doing around the value proposition is getting -- we're getting consumers to use the card more often and they're also spending more on the card when they use it. So I think all those trends are moving -- continue to move in the right direction, but they did get incrementally better this quarter from where we've been trending."

So those are all positives some of those were factored in the guidance we gave you and some of them came in a little bit better. I think as you think about the rest of the year, if deposit growth continues at this pace, we could see some benefit there on our margins. We're always looking at ways to optimize liquidity, so there could be a slight benefit there. However, there probably would be a couple of offsets. One is a we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. You saw that this quarter, and so you'll see a little bit of an offset in our receivable yields. And then our guidance did include, if you remember, it included 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year, and we had those in June and December and so the markets pricing and maybe one rate increase. So that would be just a little bit of pressure on the guidance. So I think some put and takes, I wouldn't think the margin for the balance of the year trending to significantly in either direction from the 15 to 76 we reported this quarter."

I think the only new dynamic is that we did see an influent deposits this quarter when the Fed raised rates.

If you just look at the straight receivable yield, it's pretty flat year-over-year. It was down 21 basis points. And that -- again, that's primarily driven by higher payment rates that we're seeing across a the portfolio and then more growth in Payment Solutions. So I wouldn't attribute really any of it to the competitive environment. If you look at loyalty cost and you really have to look at loyalty cost in conjunction with the RSA and some of the marketing spend, we're going to continue to launch attractive value proposition to drive growth. I wouldn't think about it direct tie-in with deposits. We're kind of -- we look at them separately. We're trying to fund the balance sheet in a very cost effective way and deposits are very cost-effective for us. We're going to continue to drive deposits, and then we're making different decisions when we look at the retail programs and how to drive growth. Our yields should continue to be pretty stable but for the 2 dynamics that I mentioned earlier, really strong growth in Payment Solutions and slightly higher payment rates."

We've got the BP portfolio, the tire center, we also the Amazon 5% value prop. You got to factor those in as we think about the second half of the year, but we're really pleased with how we started. We didn't get a ton of help from retail sales. They were pretty much more the same of what we've been seeing. So we're definitely taking share. We definitely outperforming.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.First quarter net earnings totaled $582 mill",1374,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.
First quarter net earnings totaled $582 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Overall, solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong double-digit growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and platform revenue this quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 17%,  and platform revenue and loan receivables grew 13%. We continue to see strong growth in our online and mobile purchase volume. Our online and mobile sales growth has been steadily accelerating and first quarter sales grew 29% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range. 
Asset quality metrics were relatively stable this quarter, in line with our expectations. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 3.85%, and our net charge-off rate was 4.7% in the range of losses we have experienced in the first quarter over the past 2 years. 
Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 7% over last year. This was largely driven by investments we made in support of our growth initiatives. However, our overall efficiency ratio improved 1.8 percentage points to 30.4%, reflecting our strong revenue growth this quarter. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which grew $10 billion or 29% to $45 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 69% of our funding sources at the high end of our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results. And at this point, you can expect for us to grow a little beyond that original target range. 
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. We plan to launch new product offerings later this year, which will augment growth and enhance the retention of our deposit base. Given the significant growth in deposits, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5. We are pleased that we were able to pay off this loan well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. 
Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.1%, calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end.
We renewed several key relationships during the quarter, including Stein Mart and La-Z-Boy. We also signed a new partnership with Marvel and recently launched the Marvel MasterCard with an attractive cashback value proposition. We are further leveraging this relationship by developing creative ways to market our deposit products to the Marvel fan base. The new value proposition delivers the greatest benefits on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. 
Cardholders receive 3% cashback on spending in these types of categories and 1% cashback on other purchases. We are excited about this partnership and the value this new card will bring to loyal Marvel fans and others who enjoy the benefits of the cashback program. The partnership will also offer a unique opportunity to co-promote our deposit products, in conjunction with the Marvel feature film. We launched a new campaign called ""Save Like a Hero"", which will feature Synchrony Bank saving products and be tied to the release of Marvel's new CAPTAIN AMERICA movie. This is the second start-up program we have rolled out in the travel and entertainment space. You'll recall that last quarter we also launched our Stash Hotel Rewards program. We think this is an area that provides attractive opportunities.
During the quarter, we also launched our new Citgo card program. Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the 5,000-plus locally owned and operated Citgo locations in the United States. We continue to work with our partners, new and existing, to develop compelling value propositions for their cardholders.
This quarter, we launched a new value prop with Walmart. The program brings even more value to the everyday purchases customers make using their Walmart cards. The 3-2-1 Save cashback program provides qualifying cardholders the opportunity to earn rewards for purchases they make every day, including 3% back on purchases made on walmart.com; 2% back on fuel purchases at Walmart and Murphy USA gas stations; and 1% back on purchases made at Walmart stores and everywhere that Walmart cards are accepted. The 3-2-1 Save program simplifies and strengthens the card proposition for Walmart cardholders. We work closely with Walmart to meet the evolving needs of their customers, and we are excited about this program as it also recognizes the increasing move to online and mobile shopping. It is the first credit card program designed to offer Walmart cardholders even greatest savings on their online purchases. We are highly focused on innovating ways to drive organic growth as it remains a key priority and opportunity. We continue to work closely with our partners to deliver growth across all sales channels.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 13%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 17% and average active account growth of 7%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 13% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers that deliver value to our partners and customers.
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver solid performance across all 3 of our sales platforms in the first quarter. Retail Card generated especially strong results this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 17%,  and receivables grew 14%. The addition of BP in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 15%. The strong growth in Retail Card was broad based as we saw growth across our partner programs.
As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter in Retail Card. We renewed and extended the Stein Mart program. We signed a new partnership with Marvel, and launched the new Marvel MasterCard this month. And we launched a new value proposition with Walmart, the 3-2-1 Save cashback program. The position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 15% and receivables grew 13%, driving platform revenue growth of 14%. Average active accounts increased 12% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We renewed a key home furnishings relationship with the extension of our La-Z-Boy partnership. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions with repeat purchase volume growing 18% year-over-year. Reuse represented 27% of purchase volume in the first quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Purchase volume was up 14% and receivables grew 9%, driving platform revenue growth of 6%. Average active accounts increased 7% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Card reuse continues to be an area of focus in CareCredit, and purchase volume from repeat usage of the card grew 17% compared to last year. Reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter.
Our CareCredit digital innovations continue to resonate with cardholders. The CareCredit app has been downloaded more than 350,000 times and visited more than 2.3 million times since we launched it last fall. In addition, our provider locator averaged more than 800,000 hits per month in the first quarter.
In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."

I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter.

In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. This compares to $552 million or $0.66 per diluted share last year. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volumes up 17%, receivables up 13% and platform revenue up 13%. Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average spend, with purchase volume per average active account increasing 9% over last year as well as growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter last year, so that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year. 
Net interest income was up 12% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables. RSAs were up slightly, $10 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with growth in the programs as well as higher loyalty cost in our share through the RSA with our retailers. We typically see the RSA decline from the fourth quarter due to lower postholiday-related volume. We still expect the RSA benefit on a full year basis to trend slightly under 4.5%. The provision increased $216 million compared to last year. While the increase was driven by receivables growth, we also had the benefit of a lower reserve build last year due to improved asset quality metrics. I'll cover this in more in detail later.
Asset quality metrics were relatively stable. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% compared to 3.79% last year, and the net charge-off rate was 4.70% compared to 4.53% last year. Credit metrics were in line with our expectations and consistent with the range we have seen in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of our receivables was 5.5%. Measured against the last 4 quarters' net charge-offs, the reserve coverage is 1.3x, which is consistent with the coverage level over the past 6 quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were stable. 
Other income decreased $9 million versus last year. Higher loyalty and rewards costs were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $30 million, driven by continued growth in our store spending in our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $32 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange in loyalty expense run back through the RSAs. So there is a partial offset on each of these items.
Debt cancellation fees of $64 million were down $1 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now to our online channel. Other expenses increased $54 million or 7% versus last year, more in line with the growth of the business. Now that we are comparing the periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth as well as strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities.
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.4%. The first quarter is typically the low point for the efficiency ratio due to marketing, business development and volume-related expenses being at their lowest level for the year. The efficiency ratio will normally increase from these levels in the remainder of the year. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our strong performance drove a solid quarter generating an ROA of 2.8%.
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.76% for the quarter, relatively stable to last year in the prior quarter. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The yield on receivables declined 21 basis points to 21.1%, reflecting higher payment rates and a slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions, where the yield is lower than our overall portfolio yield. The decline in receivables yield was offset by a slight benefit from rates earned in our liquidity portfolio due to higher short-term benchmark rates, resulting from the Fed tightening in December. We also benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan facility. 
The cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.9% due to an increase from rising short-term benchmark rates and the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance, which was largely offset by a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan and the payoff for the GE Capital loan last year. Our deposit base increased by over $10 billion or 29% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 69% of our funding versus 59% last year. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance.
Next I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continued to see relatively stable asset quality performance, which was generally in line with our expectations. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% versus 3.79% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.84% compared to 1.81% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate was 4.7% compared to 4.53% in the first quarter last year. Both the delinquency metrics and net charge-off levels are consistent with the results in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015. We continue to believe the performance is being sustained due in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends. 
Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%, down slightly from 5.59% last year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we're currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve, which is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $800 million for the quarter, a 7% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities.
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $41 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. 
Professional fees were down $16 million, driven primarily by lower third-party spends as a result of our completion of the separation from GE. 
Marketing and business development costs were up $12 million. The higher costs were driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume receivables. 
Information processing was up $19 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter due to seasonal low points in marketing, business development and volume-related expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year. However, we expect it to remain below 34%, in line with what we communicated back in January.
Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $10 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 69% of our funding, which is near the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved further towards the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. 
We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year, such as checking and online bill pay. Given we are near the top end of our range and we expect to continue to drive deposit growth, we would expect deposits to move a little above 70% of our funding in the upcoming quarters. Longer term, once we reach our optimal mix of deposits, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivable growth. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion explained and is now 19% of our funding. In March, we successfully issued $750 million in 3-year notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loans and senior unsecured notes now totaled 12% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy was to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this would become a more expensive source of funding for the business as rates start to rise. 
Given the significant growth in deposits, we made $2.7 billion of prepayments in the quarter and paid off the remaining $1.5 billion in early April. We are pleased to have fully paid this loan off well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.1%, CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.4% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 110 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $22.2 billion and includes $14.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.3 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.
I'd also like to provide an update on our capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March, and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the time line we've communicated on previous calls. 
Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

We continue to think that losses will be stable for the balance of the year. We've been pretty clear that we don't expect them to get better from here, and I think that's pretty consistent across the industry. If you look at the performance in the quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. If you look at the year-over-year comparison, you have to remember that we had a really strong first quarter last year, which was -- frankly is better than we expected. We only had a $19 million reserve build in the first quarter last year. So really what you're seeing now is more of a normalization and generally more in line with our expectations. So if you look at reserve coverage levels, they're also very consistent. Reserve coverage as a percent of receivables was 5.5%. It was down just 9 basis points from last year. If you look at the reserve coverage against last 12 months' charge-offs, it was 1.29x versus 1.26x a year ago, so also very consistent. So I think for the balance of the year, we continue to see losses will be stable, an overall change to that 2-year kind of average that we gave in January."

I think we said in the past that we do have BP in the numbers, so that's a little bit of the growth. But the real growth is coming from organic growth and increased penetration and throughout CareCredit 50% of the sales are repeat. And Payment Solutions, we're seeing nice repeat. I think one of the key drivers of our results is really 2 things. One is the value props that we continue to enhance and drive into our retailers, and we work closely with them to really develop those value propositions. And going back to our financing about the consumer being stable on credit, I do think consumers continue to look for a reason to shop. So having very strong value propositions is really key. The second is really all the innovation we continue to do on mobile. Our online sales overall were up 29% year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a testament to the ability to apply and buy I think. And you combine that with the strong value propositions. I think this is why you're really seeing the kind of growth you're seeing. So I'd say most of it is through existing cardholders who are deepening their loyalty to the brand of that particular retailer. On the pipeline itself, our pipeline continues to remain robust. It's really a mix, I'd say, of startups as well as existing portfolios that we're looking to win. It's a combination of both. We have, as I said in the past, dedicated resources in all 3 platforms. We're working on our network, so in CareCredit being able to add Rite Aid, things like that. So very focused on the front end on winning the deals and feel we have a good pipeline going forward."

So the -- I would say the trends have picked up a little bit from recent quarters, primarily around active account growth. So the big thing for us relative to general purpose cards, we're always measuring active accounts, and that, obviously, includes new accounts. Active accounts are more important for us because we're trying to create those incentives for cardholders to use the card more often. We want to create value propositions that push our card more towards the top of wallet. And so if you look at purchase volume growth, about half of that came from higher spend per active account. That was up about 8.5% from the prior year, and then the other half came from an increase in the overall active accounts, up 7.5%. So a lot of what we're doing around the value proposition is getting -- we're getting consumers to use the card more often, and they're also spending more on the card when they use it. So I think all those trends are moving -- continue to move in the right direction, but they did get incrementally better this quarter from where we've been trending."

So those are all positives and some of those were factored in the guidance we gave you and some of them came in a little bit better. I think as you think about the rest of the year, if deposit growth continues at this pace, we could see some benefit there on our margins. We're always looking at ways to optimize liquidity, so there could be a slight benefit there. However, there could probably be a couple of offsets. One is we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. You saw that this quarter, and so you'll see a little bit of an offset in our receivable yields. And then our guidance did include, if you remember, it included 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year, and we had those in June and December and so the markets pricing and maybe one rate increase. So that would be just a little bit of pressure on the guidance.

So for us, the more we grow the program and the more we drive loyalty in the cards through those value proposition, the better we are off as well as the partner.

I think the only new dynamic is that we did see an influent deposits this quarter when the Fed raised rates. We didn't move our rates, but I think the announcement of a rate hike prompted people to go check what they were earning in traditional savings account and they decided to move some money around, so we did see a benefit from that in the quarter. In terms of the target range, we're at 69% of our total funding. We gave you a range of between 60% to 70%. So we're at the high end right now. In my earlier comments, I indicated that we're going to continue to grow deposits.

And I think in all of our big programs, the most important thing is for us to really connect with the strategy that that particular retailer or partner is really trying to drive. And so the engagement, both from an analytics and marketing perspective is just so high. You don't necessarily always get that same connection when you're doing the co-brand, so I think that makes a big difference. I think the other thing that all retailers are really facing is how do they reach out to their target markets. And I think the fact that we had this 29% online growth overall year-over-year is certainly a way for us to really continue to connect with the partners because the reality is consumers are shopping differently. So I think really be engaged at the strategy level with the retailers is probably one of the, I think, bigger differences between what we're doing on that side versus generic co-brand."

So it looks like the allowance, the reserve rate has essentially peaked in the first quarter, and we saw that in '15 and then it kind of gradually decreases again before peaking in the next quarter of the next year. And as we've been looking at year-over-year trends, that reserve rate has actually been following every single one of the periods that are shown here. And similarly, first quarter '16 fell over first quarter '15. But at some point, should we expect the year-over-year to reflect an increase similar to kind of what the charge-off rates up above, we have been seeing year-over-year declines. Now this quarter we saw year-over-year increase. So when should we, for modeling purposes, expect that to happen for the reserve rate as well?"

That's very consistent. And so I think you're going to start to see that normalization as you go and compare the prior quarter from the prior year. So I think you're seeing it now. I would tell you to look at both the reserve coverage as a percent of the receivables as well as look at the reserves as a percent of -- or against last 12 months net charge-offs.

And if I may, an industry level question for you, Margaret. So there's been, I guess, a lot of focus on the friction in the payments ecosystem, that certain players like PayPal have created by getting customers to fund their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts effectively disintermediating Visa and MasterCard and their issuing bank partners. And if you extend that thought process, part of the Synchrony value proposition to its retail partners is not charging interchange on their private label transactions. And in a sense, one could argue that private label is effectively disintermediating general purpose cards, but there doesn't -- and of course, we've seen some private label market share gains over the last decade or so. But there doesn't seem to be as much friction between Synchrony and Visa MasterCard and their issuing bank partners. So I was hoping maybe you could just speak to the health of your relationship with the payment networks and then maybe also just touch on some of those dynamics."

And so we had a lot of things that we're measuring. But one of the big ones for the credit program was the revolver versus transactors, and we've monitored. It's coming in pretty close to what we forecast. So far, very much in line with our expectations. And obviously, the point you made is a good one, which is part of why you see loyalty expense growing a little bit faster than interchange because that's the program where we do have a very attractive value proposition but we don't charge interchange to Amazon.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.First quarter net earnings totaled $582 mill",1374,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.
First quarter net earnings totaled $582 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Overall, solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong double-digit growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and platform revenue this quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 17%,  and platform revenue and loan receivables grew 13%. We continue to see strong growth in our online and mobile purchase volume. Our online and mobile sales growth has been steadily accelerating and first quarter sales grew 29% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range. 
Asset quality metrics were relatively stable this quarter, in line with our expectations. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 3.85%, and our net charge-off rate was 4.7% in the range of losses we have experienced in the first quarter over the past 2 years. 
Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 7% over last year. This was largely driven by investments we made in support of our growth initiatives. However, our overall efficiency ratio improved 1.8 percentage points to 30.4%, reflecting our strong revenue growth this quarter. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which grew $10 billion or 29% to $45 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 69% of our funding sources at the high end of our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results. And at this point, you can expect for us to grow a little beyond that original target range. 
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. We plan to launch new product offerings later this year, which will augment growth and enhance the retention of our deposit base. Given the significant growth in deposits, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5. We are pleased that we were able to pay off this loan well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.1%, calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end.
We renewed several key relationships during the quarter, including Stein Mart and La-Z-Boy. We also signed a new partnership with Marvel and recently launched the Marvel MasterCard with an attractive cashback value proposition. We are further leveraging this relationship by developing creative ways to market our deposit products to the Marvel fan base. The new value proposition delivers the greatest benefits on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. 
Cardholders receive 3% cashback on spending in these types of categories and 1% cashback on other purchases. We are excited about this partnership and the value this new card will bring to loyal Marvel fans and others who enjoy the benefits of a cashback program. The partnership will also offer a unique opportunity to co-promote our deposit products, in conjunction with the Marvel feature film. We launched a new campaign called ""Save Like a Hero"", which will feature Synchrony Bank saving products and be tied to the release of Marvel's new CAPTAIN AMERICA movie. This is the second start-up program we have rolled out in the travel and entertainment space. You'll recall that last quarter we also launched our Stash Hotel Rewards program. We think this is an area that provides attractive opportunities.
During the quarter, we also launched our new Citgo card program. Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the 5,000-plus locally owned and operated Citgo locations in the United States. We continue to work with our partners, new and existing, to develop compelling value propositions for their cardholders.
This quarter, we launched a new value prop with Walmart. The program brings even more value to the everyday purchases customers make using their Walmart cards. The 3-2-1 Save cashback program provides qualifying cardholders the opportunity to earn rewards for purchases they make every day, including 3% back on purchases made on walmart.com; 2% back on fuel purchases at Walmart and Murphy USA gas stations; and 1% back on purchases made at Walmart stores and everywhere that Walmart cards are accepted. The 3-2-1 Save program simplifies and strengthens the card proposition for Walmart cardholders. We work closely with Walmart to meet the evolving needs of their customers, and we are excited about this program as it also recognizes the increasing move to online and mobile shopping. It is the first credit card program designed to offer Walmart cardholders even greater savings on their online purchases. We are highly focused on innovating ways to drive organic growth as it remains a key priority and opportunity. We continue to work closely with our partners to deliver growth across all sales channels.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 13%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 17% and average active account growth of 7%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 13% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers that deliver value to our partners and customers.
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver solid performance across all 3 of our sales platforms in the first quarter. Retail Card generated especially strong results this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 17%,  and receivables grew 14%. The addition of BP in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 15%. The strong growth in Retail Card was broad based as we saw growth across our partner programs.
As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter in Retail Card. We renewed and extended the Stein Mart program. We signed a new partnership with Marvel, and launched the new Marvel MasterCard this month. And we launched a new value proposition with Walmart, the 3-2-1 Save cashback program. The position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 15% and receivables grew 13%, driving platform revenue growth of 14%. Average active accounts increased 12% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We renewed a key home furnishings relationship with the extension of our La-Z-Boy partnership. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions with repeat purchase volume growing 18% year-over-year. Reuse represented 27% of purchase volume in the first quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Purchase volume was up 14% and receivables grew 9%, driving platform revenue growth of 6%. Average active accounts increased 7% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Card reuse continues to be an area of focus in CareCredit, and purchase volume from repeat usage of the card grew 17% compared to last year. Reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter.
Our CareCredit digital innovations continue to resonate with cardholders. The CareCredit app has been downloaded more than 350,000 times and visited more than 2.3 million times since we launched it last fall. In addition, our provider locator averaged more than 800,000 hits per month in the first quarter.
In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."

I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter.

In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. This compares to $552 million or $0.66 per diluted share last year. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volumes up 17%, receivables up 13% and platform revenue up 13%. Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average spend, with purchase volume per average active account increasing 9% over last year as well as growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter last year, so that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year. 
Net interest income was up 12% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables. RSAs were up slightly, $10 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with growth in the programs as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. We typically see the RSA decline from the fourth quarter due to lower postholiday-related volume. We still expect the RSA benefit on a full year basis to trend slightly under 4.5%. The provision increased $216 million compared to last year. While the increase was driven by receivables growth, we also had the benefit of a lower reserve build last year due to improved asset quality metrics. I'll cover this in more detail later.
Asset quality metrics were relatively stable. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% compared to 3.79% last year, and the net charge-off rate was 4.70% compared to 4.53% last year. Credit metrics were in line with our expectations and consistent with the range we have seen in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%. Measured against the last 4 quarters' net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3x, which is consistent with the coverage level over the past 6 quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were stable. 
Other income decreased $9 million versus last year. Higher loyalty and rewards costs were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $30 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $32 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange in loyalty expense run back through the RSAs. So there is a partial offset on each of these items.
Debt cancellation fees of $64 million were down $1 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $54 million or 7% versus last year, more in line with the growth of the business. Now that we are comparing the periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth as well as strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities.
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.4%. The first quarter is typically the low point for the efficiency ratio due to marketing, business development and volume-related expenses being at their lowest level for the year. The efficiency ratio will normally increase from these levels in the remainder of the year. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our strong performance drove a solid quarter generating an ROA of 2.8%.
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.76% for the quarter, relatively stable to last year and the prior quarter. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The yield on receivables declined 21 basis points to 21.1%, reflecting higher payment rates and a slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions, where the yield is lower than our overall portfolio yield. The decline in receivables yield was offset by a slight benefit from rates earned in our liquidity portfolio due to higher short-term benchmark rates, resulting from the Fed tightening in December. We also benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan facility. 
The cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.9% due to an increase from rising short-term benchmark rates and the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance, which was largely offset by a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan and the payoff of the GE Capital loan last year. Our deposit base increased by over $10 billion or 29% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 69% of our funding versus 59% last year. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance.
Next I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continued to see relatively stable asset quality performance, which was generally in line with our expectations. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% versus 3.79% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.84% compared to 1.81% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate was 4.7% compared to 4.53% in the first quarter last year. Both the delinquency metrics and net charge-off levels are consistent with the results in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015. We continue to believe the performance is being sustained due in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends. 
Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%, down slightly from 5.59% last year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we're currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve, which is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $800 million for the quarter, a 7% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities.
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $41 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. 
Professional fees were down $16 million, driven primarily by lower third-party expense as a result of our completion of the separation from GE. 
Marketing and business development costs were up $12 million. The higher costs were driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume receivables. 
Information processing was up $19 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter due to seasonal low points in marketing, business development and volume-related expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year. However, we expect it to remain below 34%, in line with what we communicated back in January.
Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $10 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 69% of our funding, which is near the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved further towards the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. 
We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year, such as checking and online bill pay. Given we are near the top end of our range and we expect to continue to drive deposit growth, we would expect deposits to move a little above 70% of our funding in the upcoming quarters. Longer term, once we reach our optimal mix of deposits, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivable growth. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 19% of our funding. In March, we successfully issued $750 million in 3-year notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loans and senior unsecured notes now total 12% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy was to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this would become a more expensive source of funding for the business as rates start to rise. 
Given the significant growth in deposits, we made $2.7 billion of prepayments in the quarter and paid off the remaining $1.5 billion in early April. We are pleased to have fully paid this loan off well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.1%, CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.4% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 110 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $22.2 billion and includes $14.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.3 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.
I'd also like to provide an update on our capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March, and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the time line we've communicated on previous calls. 
Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

We continue to think that losses will be stable for the balance of the year. We've been pretty clear that we don't expect them to get better from here, and I think that's pretty consistent across the industry. If you look at the performance in the quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. If you look at the year-over-year comparison, you have to remember that we had a really strong first quarter last year, which was -- frankly is better than we expected. We only had a $19 million reserve build in the first quarter last year. So really what you're seeing now is more of a normalization and generally more in line with our expectations. So if you look at reserve coverage levels, they're also very consistent. Reserve coverage as a percent of receivables was 5.5%. It was down just 9 basis points from last year. If you look at the reserve coverage against last 12 months' charge-offs, it was 1.29x versus 1.26x a year ago, so also very consistent. So I think for the balance of the year, we continue to say that losses will be stable, no real change to that 2-year kind of average that we gave in January."

And then the portfolio pipeline for new deals, can you maybe talk about potential startups and maybe any other portfolio deals that you're looking at?"
260334235,329083344,962035,"Synchrony Financial, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Sure.

I think we said in the past that we do have BP in the numbers, so that's a little bit of the growth. But the real growth is coming from organic growth and increased penetration and throughout CareCredit 50% of the sales are repeat. And Payment Solutions, we're seeing nice repeat. I think one of the key drivers of our results is really two things. One is the value props that we continue to enhance and drive into our retailers, and we work closely with them to really develop those value propositions. And going back to what Brian's saying about the consumer being stable on credit, I do think consumers continue to look for a reason to shop. So having very strong value propositions is really key. The second is really all the innovation we continue to do on mobile. Our online sales overall were up 29% year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a testament to the ability to apply and buy I think. And you combine that with the strong value propositions. I think this is why you're really seeing the kind of growth you're seeing. So I'd say most of it is through existing cardholders who are deepening their loyalty to the brand of that particular retailer. On the pipeline itself, our pipeline continues to remain robust. It's really a mix, I'd say, of startups as well as existing portfolios that we're looking to win. It's a combination of both. We have, as I've said in the past, dedicated resources in all 3 platforms. We're working on our network, so in CareCredit being able to add Rite Aid, things like that. So very focused on the front end on winning the deals and feel we have a good pipeline going forward."

So the -- I would say the trends have picked up a little bit from recent quarters, primarily around active account growth. So the big thing for us relative to general purpose cards, we're always measuring active accounts, and that, obviously, includes new accounts. Active accounts are more important for us because we're trying to create those incentives for cardholders to use the card more often. We want to create value propositions that push our card more towards the top of wallet. And so if you look at purchase volume growth, about half of that came from higher spend per active account. That was up about 8.5% from the prior year, and then the other half came from an increase in overall active accounts, up 7.5%. So a lot of what we're doing around the value proposition is getting -- we're getting consumers to use the card more often, and they're also spending more on the card when they use it. So I think all those trends are moving -- continue to move in the right direction, but they did get incrementally better this quarter from where we'd been trending."

It's pretty stable in the second quarter. And then we always see a seasonal increase in the RSA percentage in the third quarter, and it comes down a bit in the fourth quarter, but it is typically elevated in the second half of the year. And then your second question around Walmart, you will see -- depending on how that plays out, it's still very early, but you will see any time we launch a value proposition, you typically see loyalty costs, interchange will increase. And there is a partial offset in the RSA for those items, but I would continue to use slightly below 4.5% range for the year that we gave you."

So those are all positives and some of those were factored in the guidance we gave you and some of them came in a little bit better. I think as you think about the rest of the year, if deposit growth continues at this pace, we could see some benefit there in our margins. We're always looking at ways to optimize liquidity, so there could be a slight benefit there. However, there could probably be a couple of offsets. One is we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. You saw that this quarter, and so you'll see a little bit of an offset in our receivable yields. And then our guidance did include, if you remember, it included 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year, we had those in June and December and so the markets pricing and maybe one rate increase. So that would be just a little bit of pressure on the guidance. So I think there's some put and takes, I wouldn't think about the margin for the balance of the year trending too significantly in either direction from the 15.76% we reported this quarter."

We're up $10 billion year-over-year, 29%. It's been fairly consistent over the past few quarters. I think the only new dynamic is that we did see an influent deposits this quarter when the Fed raised rates. We didn't move our rates, but I think the announcement of a rate hike prompted people to go check what they were earning in traditional savings account and they decided to move some money around, so we did see a benefit from that in the quarter. In terms of the target range, we're at 69% of our total funding. We gave you a range of between 60% to 70%. So we're at the high end right now. In my earlier comments, I indicated that we're going to continue to grow deposits. We'll probably grow deposits faster than we're growing our receivables, at least based on the market conditions that we see right now. So I would expect that deposit percentage to trend a little above 70% in the next few quarters.

I wouldn't think about a direct tie-in with deposits. We're kind of -- we look at them separately. We're trying to fund the balance sheet in a very cost-effective way and deposits are very cost-effective for us.

So I was hoping maybe you could just speak to the health of your relationship with the payment networks and then maybe also just touch on some of those dynamics."

So I think the position we have taken is that all of the players that you talk about are really partners of ours, including PayPal, by the way, where we offer our credit program. So for us, it's really about getting our cards in that wallet -- whatever that wallet is -- to be top of wallet and to get the consumer to use it more. And I think the connection we have with merchants I think is very different than many of the players out there. And I think that's the value we bring even to some of the partners you talked about, like Visa or MasterCard and a PayPal, right? So we have that very tight connection with the merchant. And so we see this all as upside for us, and continue to see that whole payment landscape as an opportunity for us to be in the forefront and continue to invest, and we'll continue to invest to be leaders in that."

And so we had a lot of things that we're measuring. But one of the big ones for the credit program was the revolver versus transactors, and we've monitored it. It's coming in pretty close to what we forecast. So far, very much in line with our expectations. And obviously, the point you made is a good one, which is part of why you see loyalty expense growing a little bit faster than interchange because that's a program where we do have a very attractive value proposition but we don't charge interchange to Amazon. So there is an offset in the RSA. It's all part of that restructuring and that agreement, and part of the extension that we do with Amazon when we launch the new value proposition."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.First quarter net earnings totaled $582 mill",1374,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.
First quarter net earnings totaled $582 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Overall, solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong double-digit growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and platform revenue this quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 17%, and platform revenue and loan receivables grew 13%. We continue to see strong growth in our online and mobile purchase volume. Our online and mobile sales growth has been steadily accelerating and first quarter sales grew 29% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range. 
Asset quality metrics were relatively stable this quarter, in line with our expectations. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 3.85%, and our net charge-off rate was 4.7% in the range of losses we have experienced in the first quarter over the past 2 years. 
Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 7% over last year. This was largely driven by investments we made in support of our growth initiatives. However, our overall efficiency ratio improved 1.8 percentage points to 30.4%, reflecting our strong revenue growth this quarter. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which grew $10 billion or 29% to $45 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 69% of our funding sources at the high end of our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results. And at this point, you can expect for us to grow a little beyond that original target range. 
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. We plan to launch new product offerings later this year, which will augment growth and enhance the retention of our deposit base. Given the significant growth in deposits, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5. We are pleased that we were able to pay off this loan well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.1%, calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end.
We renewed several key relationships during the quarter, including Stein Mart and La-Z-Boy. We also signed a new partnership with Marvel and recently launched the Marvel MasterCard with an attractive cashback value proposition. We are further leveraging this relationship by developing creative ways to market our deposit products to the Marvel fan base. The new value proposition delivers the greatest benefits on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. 
Cardholders receive 3% cashback on spending in these types of categories and 1% cashback on other purchases. We are excited about this partnership and the value this new card will bring to loyal Marvel fans and others who enjoy the benefits of a cashback program. The partnership will also offer a unique opportunity to co-promote our deposit products, in conjunction with the Marvel feature film. We launched a new campaign called ""Save Like a Hero"", which will feature Synchrony Bank saving products and be tied to the release of Marvel's new CAPTAIN AMERICA movie. This is the second start-up program we have rolled out in the travel and entertainment space. You'll recall that last quarter we also launched our Stash Hotel Rewards program. We think this is an area that provides attractive opportunities.
During the quarter, we also launched our new Citgo card program. Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the 5,000-plus locally owned and operated Citgo locations in the United States. We continue to work with our partners, new and existing, to develop compelling value propositions for their cardholders.
This quarter, we launched a new value prop with Walmart. The program brings even more value to the everyday purchases customers make using their Walmart cards. The 3-2-1 Save cashback program provides qualifying cardholders the opportunity to earn rewards for purchases they make every day, including 3% back on purchases made on walmart.com; 2% back on fuel purchases at Walmart and Murphy USA gas stations; and 1% back on purchases made at Walmart stores and everywhere that Walmart cards are accepted. The 3-2-1 Save program simplifies and strengthens the card proposition for Walmart cardholders. We work closely with Walmart to meet the evolving needs of their customers, and we are excited about this program as it also recognizes the increasing move to online and mobile shopping. It is the first credit card program designed to offer Walmart cardholders even greater savings on their online purchases. We are highly focused on innovating ways to drive organic growth as it remains a key priority and opportunity. We continue to work closely with our partners to deliver growth across all sales channels.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 13%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 17% and average active account growth of 7%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 13% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers that deliver value to our partners and customers.
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver solid performance across all 3 of our sales platforms in the first quarter. Retail Card generated especially strong results this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 17%, and receivables grew 14%. The addition of BP in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 15%. The strong growth in Retail Card was broad based as we saw growth across our partner programs.
As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter in Retail Card. We renewed and extended the Stein Mart program. We signed a new partnership with Marvel, and launched the new Marvel MasterCard this month. And we launched a new value proposition with Walmart, the 3-2-1 Save cashback program. The position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 15% and receivables grew 13%, driving platform revenue growth of 14%. Average active accounts increased 12% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We renewed a key home furnishings relationship with the extension of our La-Z-Boy partnership. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions with repeat purchase volume growing 18% year-over-year. Reuse represented 27% of purchase volume in the first quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Purchase volume was up 14% and receivables grew 9%, driving platform revenue growth of 6%. Average active accounts increased 7% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Card reuse continues to be an area of focus in CareCredit, and purchase volume from repeat usage of the card grew 17% compared to last year. Reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter.
Our CareCredit digital innovations continue to resonate with cardholders. The CareCredit app has been downloaded more than 350,000 times and visited more than 2.3 million times since we launched it last fall. In addition, our provider locator averaged more than 800,000 hits per month in the first quarter.
In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."

I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. This compares to $552 million or $0.66 per diluted share last ye",1946,"Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. This compares to $552 million or $0.66 per diluted share last year. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volumes up 17%, receivables up 13% and platform revenue up 13%. Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average spend, with purchase volume per average active account increasing 9% over last year as well as growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter last year, so that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year. 
Net interest income was up 12% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables. RSAs were up slightly, $10 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with growth in the programs as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. We typically see the RSA decline from the fourth quarter due to lower postholiday-related volume. We still expect the RSA benefit on a full year basis to trend slightly under 4.5%. The provision increased $216 million compared to last year. While the increase was driven by receivables growth, we also had the benefit of a lower reserve build last year due to improved asset quality metrics. I'll cover this in more detail later.
Asset quality metrics were relatively stable. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% compared to 3.79% last year, and the net charge-off rate was 4.70% compared to 4.53% last year. Credit metrics were in line with our expectations and consistent with the range we have seen in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%. Measured against the last 4 quarters' net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3x, which is consistent with the coverage level over the past 6 quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were stable. 
Other income decreased $9 million versus last year. Higher loyalty and rewards costs were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $30 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $32 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange in loyalty expense run back through the RSAs. So there is a partial offset on each of these items.
Debt cancellation fees of $64 million were down $1 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $54 million or 7% versus last year, more in line with the growth of the business. Now that we are comparing the periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth as well as strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities.
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.4%. The first quarter is typically the low point for the efficiency ratio due to marketing, business development and volume-related expenses being at their lowest level for the year. The efficiency ratio will normally increase from these levels in the remainder of the year. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our strong performance drove a solid quarter generating an ROA of 2.8%.
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.76% for the quarter, relatively stable to last year and the prior quarter. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The yield on receivables declined 21 basis points to 21.1%, reflecting higher payment rates and a slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions, where the yield is lower than our overall portfolio yield. The decline in receivables yield was offset by a slight benefit from rates earned in our liquidity portfolio due to higher short-term benchmark rates, resulting from the Fed tightening in December. We also benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan facility. 
The cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.9% due to an increase from rising short-term benchmark rates and the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance, which was largely offset by a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan and the payoff of the GE Capital loan last year. Our deposit base increased by over $10 billion or 29% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 69% of our funding versus 59% last year. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance.
Next I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continued to see relatively stable asset quality performance, which was generally in line with our expectations. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% versus 3.79% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.84% compared to 1.81% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate was 4.7% compared to 4.53% in the first quarter last year. Both the delinquency metrics and net charge-off levels are consistent with the results in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015. We continue to believe the performance is being sustained due in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends. 
Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%, down slightly from 5.59% last year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we're currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve, which is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $800 million for the quarter, a 7% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities.
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $41 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. 
Professional fees were down $16 million, driven primarily by lower third-party expense as a result of our completion of the separation from GE. 
Marketing and business development costs were up $12 million. The higher costs were driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume receivables. 
Information processing was up $19 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter due to seasonal low points in marketing, business development and volume-related expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year. However, we expect it to remain below 34%, in line with what we communicated back in January.
Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $10 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 69% of our funding, which is near the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved further towards the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. 
We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year, such as checking and online bill pay. Given we are near the top end of our range and we expect to continue to drive deposit growth, we would expect deposits to move a little above 70% of our funding in the upcoming quarters. Longer term, once we reach our optimal mix of deposits, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivable growth. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 19% of our funding. In March, we successfully issued $750 million in 3-year notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loans and senior unsecured notes now total 12% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy was to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this would become a more expensive source of funding for the business as rates start to rise. 
Given the significant growth in deposits, we made $2.7 billion of prepayments in the quarter and paid off the remaining $1.5 billion in early April. We are pleased to have fully paid this loan off well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.1%, CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.4% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 110 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $22.2 billion and includes $14.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.3 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.
I'd also like to provide an update on our capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March, and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the time line we've communicated on previous calls. 
Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

We continue to think that losses will be stable for the balance of the year. We've been pretty clear that we don't expect them to get better from here, and I think that's pretty consistent across the industry. If you look at the performance in the quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. If you look at the year-over-year comparison, you have to remember that we had a really strong first quarter last year, which was -- frankly is better than we expected. We only had a $19 million reserve build in the first quarter last year. So really what you're seeing now is more of a normalization and generally more in line with our expectations. So if you look at reserve coverage levels, they're also very consistent. Reserve coverage as a percent of receivables was 5.5%. It was down just 9 basis points from last year. If you look at the reserve coverage against last 12 months' charge-offs, it was 1.29x versus 1.26x a year ago, so also very consistent. So I think for the balance of the year, we continue to say that losses will be stable, no real change to that 2-year kind of average that we gave in January."

You highlighted a couple of times that the year-over-year growth from BP will subside next quarter. So I just want to think -- understand how to think about loan growth. And then the portfolio pipeline for new deals, can you maybe talk about potential startups and maybe any other portfolio deals that you're looking at?"
260334235,329083344,962203,"Synchrony Financial, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Sure.

I think we said in the past that we do have BP in the numbers, so that's a little bit of the growth. But the real growth is coming from organic growth and increased penetration and throughout CareCredit 50% of the sales are repeat. And Payment Solutions, we're seeing nice repeat. I think one of the key drivers of our results is really 2 things. One is the value props that we continue to enhance and drive into our retailers, and we work closely with them to really develop those value propositions. And going back to what Brian's saying about the consumer being stable on credit, I do think consumers continue to look for a reason to shop. So having very strong value propositions is really key. The second is really all the innovation we continue to do on mobile. Our online sales overall were up 29% year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a testament to the ability to apply and buy I think. And you combine that with the strong value propositions. I think this is why you're really seeing the kind of growth you're seeing. So I'd say most of it is through existing cardholders who are deepening their loyalty to the brand of that particular retailer. On the pipeline itself, our pipeline continues to remain robust. It's really a mix, I'd say, of startups as well as existing portfolios that we're looking to win. It's a combination of both. We have, as I've said in the past, dedicated resources in all 3 platforms. We're working on our network, so in CareCredit being able to add Rite Aid, things like that. So very focused on the front end on winning the deals and feel we have a good pipeline going forward."

So the -- I would say the trends have picked up a little bit from recent quarters, primarily around active account growth. So the big thing for us relative to general purpose cards, we're always measuring active accounts, and that, obviously, includes new accounts. Active accounts are more important for us because we're trying to create those incentives for cardholders to use the card more often. We want to create value propositions that push our card more towards the top of wallet. And so if you look at purchase volume growth, about half of that came from higher spend per active account. That was up about 8.5% from the prior year, and then the other half came from an increase in overall active accounts, up 7.5%. So a lot of what we're doing around the value proposition is getting -- we're getting consumers to use the card more often, and they're also spending more on the card when they use it. So I think all those trends are moving -- continue to move in the right direction, but they did get incrementally better this quarter from where we'd been trending."

So those are all positives and some of those were factored in the guidance we gave you and some of them came in a little bit better. I think as you think about the rest of the year, if deposit growth continues at this pace, we could see some benefit there in our margins. We're always looking at ways to optimize liquidity, so there could be a slight benefit there. However, there could probably be a couple of offsets. One is we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. You saw that this quarter, and so you'll see a little bit of an offset in our receivable yields. And then our guidance did include, if you remember, it included 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year, we had those in June and December and so the markets pricing and maybe one rate increase. So that would be just a little bit of pressure on the guidance.

So for us, the more we grow the program and the more we drive loyalty in the cards through those value proposition, the better we are off as well as the partner. We're pretty excited with this particular launch because it's a program that I think aligns very close to the strategic direction of Walmart, where they really want to drive online sales.

We're up $10 billion year-over-year, 29%. It's been fairly consistent over the past few quarters. I think the only new dynamic is that we did see an influent deposits this quarter when the Fed raised rates. We didn't move our rates, but I think the announcement of a rate hike prompted people to go check what they were earning in traditional savings account and they decided to move some money around, so we did see a benefit from that in the quarter. In terms of the target range, we're at 69% of our total funding. We gave you a range of between 60% to 70%. So we're at the high end right now. In my earlier comments, I indicated that we're going to continue to grow deposits. We'll probably grow deposits faster than we're growing our receivables, at least based on the market conditions that we see right now. So I would expect that deposit percentage to trend a little above 70% in the next few quarters. And then we're always looking at whether or not we should revisit that target and maybe take it up a little bit, but I think we're going to see how the rest of the year plays out before we do anything there."

So I wouldn't attribute really any of it to the competitive environment. If you look at loyalty costs and you really have to look at loyalty costs in conjunction with the RSA and some of the marketing spend, we're going to continue to launch attractive value propositions to drive growth. I wouldn't think about a direct tie-in with deposits. We're kind of -- we look at them separately. We're trying to fund the balance sheet in a very cost-effective way and deposits are very cost-effective for us. We're going to continue to drive deposits, and then we're making different decisions when we look at the retail programs and how to drive growth.

You don't necessarily always get that same connection when you're doing the co-brand, so I think that makes a big difference. I think the other thing that all retailers are really facing is how do they reach out to their target markets. And I think the fact that we had this 29% online growth overall year-over-year is certainly a way for us to really continue to connect with the partners because the reality is consumers are shopping differently.

And so that's part of the reason why, if you remember, when we launched it, we launched it with a soft launch, because we wanted to monitor the mix of consumers, and we wanted to make sure that we were sizing lines appropriately, that -- it was a good experience for the prime customer, that we were generating increment sales for Amazon. And so we had a lot of things that we're measuring. But one of the big ones for the credit program was the revolver versus transactors, and we've monitored it. It's coming in pretty close to what we forecast. So far, very much in line with our expectations. And obviously, the point you made is a good one, which is part of why you see loyalty expense growing a little bit faster than interchange because that's a program where we do have a very attractive value proposition but we don't charge interchange to Amazon. So there is an offset in the RSA. It's all part of that restructuring and that agreement, and part of the extension that we do with Amazon when we launch the new value proposition."

During the call today, I'll provide a review of the quarter and then Brian will give details on our financial results. 
I'll begin on Slide 3. Second quarter net earnings totaled $489 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms driving strong growth and purchase volumes, loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. Purchase volume grew 9%, loan receivables grew 11%, and net interest income grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. 
Our online and mobile purchase volume also continued its strong growth trajectory. Second quarter sales grew 27% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range. 
As for asset quality metrics, 30-plus-day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year. And our net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% in the second quarter of last year. 
Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 4% over last year and were largely driven by the growth we are producing. We generated positive operating leverage, and our overall efficiency ratio improved 157 basis points to 31.9%. 
Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $46 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. And though this is slightly above our original target range of 60% to 70%, we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by offering competitive rates, outstanding customer service and a continued enhancement of our product suite. One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading, full-scale online bank. Given our significant deposit growth, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5, well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.5% and liquid assets totaling $14 billion or 17% of total assets at quarter-end. The strength of our balance sheet and financial performance has enabled us to start returning capital to shareholders. As we announced earlier this month, our board approved a $0.13 quarterly dividend and a $952 million annual share repurchase program. We will now begin to opportunistically repurchase our stock and look forward to building on these actions as we look to deploy capital through both growth of the business and return to shareholders. 
Moving to business highlights. We recently renewed several key relationships including: Ashley Homestore, Suzuki, VCA Animal Hospitals and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. We also continued to sign new partnerships in the travel and entertainment space. We won a new U.S.-based program with Cathay Pacific Airways. We also signed a new program with Fareportal, one of the largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. These programs add to our growing T&E portfolio that already includes recently launched programs with Stash Hotel Rewards and Marvel Entertainment. The launch of our new program with Marvel this quarter includes an attractive cashback value proposition were the greatest benefits are accrued on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. We're excited about these new partnerships as we believe this is a segment that provides attractive opportunities, and we are pleased to expand our presence in it. We also launched a new program with Mattress Firm, one of the nation's premier specialty bedding retailers. We continue to be highly focused on driving organic growth and pursuing new opportunities to grow our business. We are working closely with our current partners to deliver incremental value and drive program growth and provide value to our cardholders. 
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remains strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans grew 10% over the second quarter last year. Previously, we had reported platform revenue. But starting with this quarter, we will utilize interest and fees on loans as a means of discussing our business performance, favoring this GAAP measure that more closely aligns with the growth metrics of our business. 
During the quarter, we continue to drive growth by delivering value to our partners and cardholders via attractive value proposition, promotional financing and marketing options. 
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the second quarter, as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card generated another strong quarter of results. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The strong growth in Retail Card continued to be broad-based as we saw growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnerships with Cathay Pacific and Fareportal and the launch of the new Marvel program. We have developed strong long-term relationships that solidify our position in this space and provide a foundation to the addition of new partnerships and the expansion into new sectors such as travel and entertainment. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 16% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest in fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. 
We had a very active quarter with the renewal of key relationships with Ashley Homestore and Suzuki and the launch of the Mattress Firm program. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions, which represent a 26% of purchase volume in the second quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong second quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 5%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties, and we are pleased to renew an important veterinary partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals as well as our strategic partnership with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card also continues to be an area of focus, and reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Each platform delivered strong results and continue to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."
260334235,372214138,1010547,"Synchrony Financial, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter, the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase",2069,"Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter, the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 9%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 10%. Average active accounts increased 8% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions in our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average balances and spend with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year. 
The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $281 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth, which I will cover in more detail later. 
Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year and slightly better than 2Q '14 of 3.82%. The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year and 4.88% in 2Q '14. Delinquencies were consistent with the range we have seen in the second quarter over the past 2 years with net charge-offs being lower than the range. 
Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.70%. As we noted in June, we expected the allowance to increased 20 to 30 basis points in the second quarter compared to the first quarter level of 5.5%. 
RSAs were up $43 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.1% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with the growth in the programs as well as the incremental reserve build, which more than offset incremental sharing on the year-over-year improvements in net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. Given the increase in the reserve level, we expect the RSA percentage on a full year basis to trend closer to the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income decreased $37 million versus last year. In the prior year, there was a $20 million gain on portfolio sales which did not repeat. The remainder of the decrease is attributable to higher loyalty and rewards cost that were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. While interchange was up $28 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that was up $41 million, primarily driven by new value propositions, including the Walmart 3-2-1 value prop. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $34 million or 4% versus last year. Now that we are comparing 2 periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth as well as strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. 
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.9%, which was 157 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and staying disciplined on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. 
Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.4%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.86% for the quarter, up 9 basis points over the last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter, as we used excess liquidity to fully pay of the bank term loan facility in early April. The yield on receivables declined 14 basis points to 21%, reflecting the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in promotional balances, particularly in Payment Solutions. The cost of funding was up 7 basis points to 1.9%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we made in growing our direct deposit platform. And deposits are now 71% of our funding [indiscernible] 61% last year. The second quarter margin was 15.86%, which was 9 basis points better than last year and slightly better than the first quarter of 15.76%. And as we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect it to be fairly stable for the balance of the year. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance. 
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. The backdrop for credit is still favorable. However, our forecast indicates that credit will gradually normalize higher from the recent lows. It's important to note that we are not seeing a step change. Our view takes into consideration factors like portfolio mix as well as account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. We consider all of these factors in our underwriting today, and we're still seeing very attractive returns across the credit spectrum. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.67% compared to 1.52% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. 
The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year and 4.88% in 2Q '14. The net charge-offs were somewhat lower than the range we had experienced over the past 2 years. 
The allowance for loan losses a percent of receivables increased to 5.7% in the second quarter, in line with the range we provided in June. This results in the allowance coverage of approximately 13 to 15 months expected charge-offs, which should be fairly consistent going forward. So as you think about credit normalization from here, we expect net charge-offs will be around 4.5% in 2016, which is largely in line with our guidance for the year. And we've indicated that we expect net charge-offs to trend 20 to 30 basis points higher over the next 4 quarters, which should be helpful as you think about 2017. 
So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment when it comes to credit as the risk-adjusted yields we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9. I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses continued to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $839 million for the quarter, a 4% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $51 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that are provided to us under the GE TSA. 
Professional fees were down $2 million. This was primarily driven by growth in the business, which was more than offset by the reduction in third-party services mentioned previously as well as expenses related to last year's EMV rollout, which did not repeat. 
Marketing and business development costs were down $1 million. Higher cost driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive strong growth. And purchase volume and receivables were offset by lower marketing costs related to our deposit platform as well as redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. 
Information processing was up $7 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. 
Other expenses down $21 million due to benefits from EMV as well as a reduction in TSA costs, which are no longer being built to us by GE. 
The efficiency ratio was 31.9% for the quarter, 157 basis points lower than last year, as the business drove positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses in the second half of the year as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, we expect it to remain below 34%, in line with what we communicated back in January. 
Moving to Slide 10. I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as recap our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This post deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. Although we have now moved slightly over the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capability. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. 
We're also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products over the next couple of years, such as checking and online bill pay. 
Funding for our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In May, we successfully issued $600 million in 5-year fixed-rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. 
Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources. This reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April, well ahead of the contractual maturity in 2019. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets. And in May, we did issue $500 million and 18-month floating rate notes. So fairly active quarter in the issuance front. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.5% CET1 under the Basel III Transition rules and 18% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.5% on the fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 150 bps over the past year. 
Total liquidity increased to $21 billion. That includes $14 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach. And these liquidity levels put as well above the required LCR levels. 
Before I wrap up, I wanted to recap our initial capital plan actions we announced on July 7. Our board approved a $0.13 quarterly common stock dividend as well as a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. We expect to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Our board also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on August 25 to holders of record at close of business in August 12. Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we're very pleased to be in a position to begin returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

Going forward, and what was included in our guidance, is that recoveries would be pretty similar to where they've been the last 2 years. So somewhere in that  1.1% to 1.2% of receivables. So that's really what was contemplated in the forward guidance. So no change to what we said in June. We gave you kind of what we think we're going to close the year at for 2016 at around 4.5% and then starting kind of incremental year-over-year 20 to 30 basis points for the first quarter and the second quarter 2017."

At that point, we had paid down the bank term loans so that we were able to optimize liquidity a bit and take some of that excess and pay down the bank term loan. We're obviously really pleased with that. And we thought, jumping off from the first quarter, the margin would be pretty stable for the balance of the year, which is right around, I think, 15 75. We still think that's a pretty good way to think about the back half of the year. If deposit growth continues at this pace, we'll get a small benefit there. We might be able to do a little bit more on liquidity, but probably not much. If you look at the year-over-year, we have been able to improve the yield that we're earning on the cash in the treasuries. But then there's some of what I would call modest offset to those 2 positives. One, we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. As you know, those are promotional balances, so those come on initially at a lower yield. And then our guidance initially back in January included a small benefit from another 50 basis points of fed rate increases in the back half of the year. And obviously, that looks a little bit less likely. So some -- a few puts and takes, I would say, but the margins should be pretty stable for the back half of the year."

And I think it was around 4% in the first half versus a guide for a 4 2 to 4 3. And that implies the RSA will be roughly in line with the back half of last year, give or take a couple of basis points. So I guess, all else equal, that will probably -- in my math, that implies either provision in the back half for this year that's similar to last year? Or we get continued improvement in efficiency. So you can maybe help us understand why the RSA would go back up to the second half of last year's level, given how much it's come down in the first half.

The RSA, obviously, included an offset on the reserve build. That's why you saw it down year-over-year. That's why we've revised guidance on RSAs from around 4.5% to 4.2% to 4.3%. You also have to remember that we had a lot of things in the P&L get better year-over-year. So we had obviously better revenue. Margins were a little bit better. Efficiency ratio was better, as you indicated. So all else being equal, that would've resulted in a higher RSA percent compared to last year. And then those improvements were both more than offset by the higher reserve build and the high provision. The one thing -- I'm not sure you take into account as you think about the back half of the year is that the third quarter is typically the high watermark on the RSA. We always get some seasonality. And if you look back over the past 2 years, you do see the RSA percentage trend up a bit in the third quarter seasonally. As you think about the back half, you've got to factor that in. But that's all included in the outlook for the 4.2% to 4.3% for the year."

And those are things like portfolio mix, platform, product, program, channel as well as account maturation of seasoning of vintages as well as the overall consumer trends. Now I'd say if you look at seasoning of vintages for us, it's absolutely plays out similarly in private label as it does for general-purpose cards. So we typically see peak losses at around 24 months. I think that's pretty consistent with the rest of the industry. However, our growth rates have been more consistent than I think others. So while it certainly plays a factor in what we're seeing in our expectation, our growth rates haven't been perfectly consistent.

So we obviously delivered I think a pretty strong efficiency ratio in the first half of the year. What I would tell you this quarter is similar to what they told you last quarter, which is we do expect the efficiency ratio to rise from here in the back half of the year. Really, for 2 reasons. We do more marketing promotions in the second half of the year, particularly around holiday. And so that drives -- that would drive an increase in the efficiency ratio. And we also have more of our strategic investments and -- stacked against the second half of the year as well. So as those investments come in throughout the year, we'd expect the ratio to increase, but we'll still be within the annual guidance of below 34% for the year."

Brian, I realized you gave guidance, and that's really helpful, but I'd like to delve into the mechanics here. When we look at the interest income in fees quarter-over-quarter, they were up about $100 million -- or excuse me, those were roughly flat. Provision was up about $100 million. That would suggest, assuming that there's a 50-50 share on the RSAs, that you would expect roughly a $50 million decline in RSA expense. We didn't see that. That wasn't our assumption either. But I'd love to talk to -- is that accrual issue? Timing issue? How do we think about this on a dollar basis as opposed to a percentage basis?"

And part of the reason for that is that all of our deals are very unique, very customized both in terms of the percentage sharing as well as the level at which we start to share with the retail partner. And for obvious reasons, we can't provide any visibility around these contractual terms. And our retailers also have seasonality. And so there are number of moving pieces that make it difficult for you to model it and to have that transparency. So we give you guidance range for the year. What you should be able to see from the quarterly results is that when things get better, we tend to share more. When things get worse, we share less with the retail partners. That dynamic, whether you're looking at it as a percent of receivables or percent of pretax earnings excluding RSA, those ratios hold, I would say, fairly consistent, but for the seasonal components that I mentioned.  I know that's not particularly helpful in terms of how you model it, but I would just continue to use the guidance that we're giving you. I think that's probably the best way for you guys to get right."

To us, that's normalization. I think others may view it differently. And as part of that dialogue, we focused more specifically around the payment behaviors that were driving the reserve builds specifically in the quarter. That was the guidance we were providing. Now I think we're trying to give you some broader context on items in the forecast that obviously influence the forecast and items that drive some of that payment behavior that we're seeing, that the forecast includes things like portfolio mix by platform, by product, program, channel, while seasoning is not as big for us, as I mentioned, as I think it may be for some others. That's included in our outlook as well. And we're also factoring the trends that we are seeing on the consumer. And I would just reiterate what I said earlier that the consumer, broadly, is still generally healthy. We said all last year that we didn't think the consumer would get better, and they continued to get better all last year. And now we're seeing those improvements subside. But the overall macro environment is still pretty strong. The thing that we're watching is the thing that I mentioned earlier, is that the consumer continues to take on more leverage. It appears to be responsible at this point. The overall levels are reasonable, if you look at them in a historic context. But it's something that we're watching carefully. And as we mentioned, we're watching what's going on in other asset classes as well and looking at the layered risk. So our forecast includes that trend continuing as well as the items I mentioned earlier."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3. Second quarter net earnings totaled $489 mi",1139,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3. 
Second quarter net earnings totaled $489 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong growth and purchase volume, loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. Purchase volume grew 9%, loan receivables grew 11%, and net interest income grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. 
Our online and mobile purchase volume also continued its strong growth trajectory. Second quarter sales grew 27% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range. 
As for asset quality metrics, 30-plus-day delinquencies were 3.79%, compared to 3.53% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% in the second quarter of last year. 
Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 4% over last year, and were largely driven by the growth we are producing. We generated positive operating leverage, and our overall efficiency ratio improved 157 basis points to 31.9%. 
Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which increased $9 billion, or 23%, to $46 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources, and though this is slightly above our original target range of 60% to 70%, we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by offering competitive rates, outstanding customer service and a continued enhancement of our product suite. 
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading, full-scale online bank. Given our significant deposit growth, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5, well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.5% and liquid assets totaling $14 billion or 17% of total assets at quarter-end. The strength of our balance sheet and financial performance has enabled us to start returning capital to shareholders. As we announced earlier this month, our board approved a $0.13 quarterly dividend and a $952 million annual share repurchase program. We will now begin to opportunistically repurchase our stock and look forward to building on these actions as we look to deploy capital through both growth of the business and return to shareholders. 
Moving to business highlights. We recently renewed several key relationships including: Ashley Homestore, Suzuki, VCA Animal Hospitals and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. We also continued to sign new partnerships in the travel and entertainment space. We won a new U.S.-based program with Cathay Pacific Airways. We also signed a new program with Fareportal, one of the largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. These programs add to our growing T&E portfolio that already includes recently launched programs with Stash Hotel Rewards and Marvel Entertainment. The launch of our new program with Marvel this quarter includes an attractive cashback value proposition where the greatest benefits are accrued on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. We're excited about these new partnerships as we believe this is a segment that provides attractive opportunities, and we are pleased to expand our presence in it. We also launched a new program with Mattress Firm, one of the nation's premier specialty bedding retailers. We continue to be highly focused on driving organic growth and pursuing new opportunities to grow our business. We are working closely with our current partners to deliver incremental value and drive program growth and provide value to our cardholders. 
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. Previously, we had reported platform revenue. But starting with this quarter, we will utilize interest and fees on loans as a means of discussing our business performance, favoring this GAAP measure that more closely aligns with the growth metrics of our business. During the quarter, we continue to drive growth by delivering value to our partners and cardholders via attractive value proposition, promotional financing and marketing offers. 
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the second quarter, as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card generated another strong quarter of results. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The strong growth in Retail Card continued to be broad-based as we saw growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnerships with Cathay Pacific and Fareportal and the launch of the new Marvel program. We have developed strong long-term relationships that solidify our position in this space and provide the foundation for the addition of new partnerships and the expansion into new sectors, such as travel and entertainment. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 16% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest in fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The majority of the industries, where we provide financing, had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. 
We had a very active quarter with the renewal of key relationships with Ashley Homestore and Suzuki and the launch of the Mattress Firm program. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions, which represented 26% of purchase volume in the second quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong second quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by a purchase volume growth of 10% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 5%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties, and we are pleased to renew an important veterinary partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals, as well as our strategic partnership with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card also continues to be an area of focus, and reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian, to provide the details on our results."

I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter, the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchas",2075,"Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter, the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volume up 9%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 10%. Average active accounts increased 8% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year. 
The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $281 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth, which I will cover in more detail later. 
Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year and slightly better than 2Q '14 of 3.82%. The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year and 4.88% in 2Q '14. Delinquencies were consistent with the range we have seen in the second quarter over the past 2 years, with net charge-offs being lower than the range. 
Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.70%. As we noted in June, we expected the allowance to increase 20 to 30 basis points in the second quarter compared to the first quarter level of 5.5%. 
RSAs were up $43 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.1% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with the growth in the programs as well as the incremental reserve build, which more than offset incremental sharing on the year-over-year improvements in net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. Given the increase in the reserve level, we expect the RSA percentage, on a full year basis, to trend closer to the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income decreased $37 million versus last year. In the prior year, there was a $20 million gain on portfolio sales which did not repeat. The remainder of the decrease is attributable to higher loyalty and rewards costs, that were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. While interchange was up $28 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by a loyalty expense that was up $41 million, primarily driven by new value propositions, including the Walmart 3-2-1 value prop. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $34 million or 4% versus last year. Now that we are comparing the periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth, as well as strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. 
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.9%, which was 157 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and staying disciplined on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. 
Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.4%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.86% for the quarter, up 9 basis points over the last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter, as we used excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. The yield on receivables declined 14 basis points to 21%, reflecting the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in promotional balances, particularly in Payment Solutions. 
The cost of funding was up 7 basis points to 1.9%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we made in growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 71% of our funding versus 61% last year. The second quarter margin was 15.86%, which was 9 basis points better than last year and slightly better than the first quarter of 15.76%. And as we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect it to be fairly stable for the balance of the year. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance. 
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. The backdrop for credit is still favorable. However, our forecast indicates that credit will gradually normalize higher from the recent lows. It's important to note that we are not seeing a step change. Our view takes into consideration factors like portfolio mix as well as account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. We consider all of these factors in our underwriting today, and we're still seeing very attractive returns across the credit spectrum. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.67% compared to 1.52% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. 
The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year and 4.88% in 2Q '14. The net charge-offs were somewhat lower than the range we had experienced over the past 2 years. 
The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.7% in the second quarter, in line with the range we provided in June. This results in the allowance coverage of approximately 13 to 15 months of expected charge-offs, which should be fairly consistent going forward. So as you think about credit normalization from here, we expect net charge-offs will be around 4.5% in 2016, which is largely in line with our guidance for the year. And we've indicated that we expect net charge-offs to trend 20 to 30 basis points higher over the next 4 quarters, which should be helpful as you think about 2017. 
So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment when it comes to credit, and the risk-adjusted yields we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $839 million for the quarter, a 4% increase over last year, and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $51 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under the GE TSA. 
Professional fees were down $2 million. This was primarily driven by growth in the business, which was more than offset by the reduction in third-party services, mentioned previously, as well as expenses related to last year's EMV rollout, which did not repeat. 
Marketing and business development costs were down $1 million. Higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were offset by lower marketing costs related to our deposit platform as well as redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. 
Information processing was up $7 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. 
Other expenses, down $21 million due to benefits from EMV as well as a reduction in TSA costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE. 
The efficiency ratio was 31.9% for the quarter, 157 basis points lower than last year, as the business drove positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses in the second half of the year as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, we expect it to remain below 34%, in line with what we communicated back in January. 
Moving to Slide 10. I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as recap our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved slightly over the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capability. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. 
We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products over the next couple of years, such as checking and online bill pay. 
Funding for our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In May, we successfully issued $600 million in 5-year fixed-rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources. This reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April, well ahead of the contractual maturity in 2019. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in May, we did issue $500 million in 18-month floating-rate notes. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front and, overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.5% CET1 under the Basel III Transition rules and 18% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.5% on the fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 150 bps over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $21 billion and includes $14 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put as well above the required LCR levels. 
Before I wrap up, I wanted to recap our initial capital plan actions we announced on July 7. Our board approved a $0.13 quarterly common stock dividend as well as a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. We expect to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Our board also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on August 25 to holders of record at close of business on August 12. 
Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we're very pleased to be in a position to begin returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

Going forward, and what was included in our guidance is that, recoveries would be pretty similar to where they've been the last 2 years. So somewhere in that 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables. So that's really what was contemplated in the forward guidance. So no change to what we said in June. We gave you a, kind of what we think, we're going to close the year at, for 2016, at around 4.5%, and then, starting, kind of, incremental year-over-year 20 to 30 basis points for the first quarter and the second quarter 2017."

You know, at that point, we had paid down the bank term loans, so we were able to optimize liquidity a bit and take some of that excess and pay down the bank term loan. We're obviously really pleased with that. And we thought, jumping off from the first quarter, the margin would be pretty stable for the balance of the year, which was right around, I think, 15.75%. We still think that's a pretty good way to think about the back half of the year. If deposit growth continues at this pace, we'll get a small benefit there. We might be able to do a little bit more on liquidity, but probably not much. If you look at the year-over-year, we have been able to improve the yield that we're earning on the cash in the treasuries. But then there's some, what I would call, modest offsets to those 2 positives. One, we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. As you know, those are promotional balances, so those come on initially at a lower yield. And then, our guidance initially, back in January, included a small benefit from another 50 basis points of fed rate increases in the back half of the year. And obviously, that looks a little bit less likely. So some -- a few puts and takes, I would say, but the margins should be pretty stable for the back half of the year."

So I guess, all else equal, that would probably -- in my math, that implies either a provision in the back half of this year that's similar to last year, or we get continued improvement in efficiency. So you can maybe help us understand, why the RSA would go back up to the second half of last year's level, given how much it's come down in the first half.

You also have to remember that, we had a lot of things in the P&L got better year-over-year. So we had, obviously, better revenue. Margins were a little bit better. Efficiency ratio was better, as you indicated. So all else being equal, that would've resulted in a higher RSA percent compared to last year. And then those improvements were both more than offset by the higher reserve build and the high provision. The one thing -- I'm not sure you're taking into account is, you think about the back half of the year is, the third quarter is typically the high watermark on the RSA. We've got some seasonality. And if you look back over the past 2 years, you do see the RSA percentage trend up a bit in the third quarter seasonally. So as you think about the back half, you've got to factor that in.

And those are things like portfolio mix, by platform, product, program, channel, as well as account maturation or seasoning of vintages as well as the overall consumer trends. Now I'd say, if you look at seasoning of vintages for us, it absolutely plays out similarly in private label as it does for general-purpose cards. So we typically see peak losses at around 24 months. I think that's pretty consistent with the rest of the industry. However, our growth rates have been more consistent than, I think, others. So while it certainly plays a factor in what we're seeing in our expectation, our growth rates haven't been perfectly consistent.

What I would tell you is, we're very focused on driving operating leverage. You saw that in the first half of this year. It's a scalable business. I mentioned the infrastructure costs and the run rate earlier. We'll continue to drive operating leverage. But as we get more efficient across the business, we're always running productivity initiatives, and we're looking at moving more customers off the paper statements to online statements, we're improving our call center and collections efficiency metrics. And so we're working on eliminating waste in the back office, things like that. And that results in real operating leverage and real productivity. And then, in parallel with that, we look at things that we feel like we need to invest in to be a very successful business for the next 10 to 15 years. And those are things that -- some of the things that Margaret talked about, investing in mobile capabilities, which is something we've been doing for 4 or 5 years; data analytics; CRM. I mean this is a rapidly changing industry, and we've got to stay on top of those things. But even after you take those incremental investments into account, we would expect to, and we would hope t continue to generate positive operating leverage. That doesn't mean we're going to generate positive operating leverage every quarter. We're not going to pass up a long -- a good long-term strategic investment to show a few basis points of improvement on the efficiency ratio in any one quarter.

I think others are watching it carefully as well. So our forecast includes that trend. It also includes the other factors that I mentioned, portfolio mix and mix by program and channel and other things. We believe this is going to result in a gradual increase in charge-offs over time. Some of that is seasoning. But as I mentioned earlier, I think seasoning, while everybody has, on a vintage, similar seasoning patterns, depending on the growth rates and the consistency of the growth rates, you could end up with a very different result, depending on the issuer.

In terms of recoveries, I would just reiterate what I said earlier. The overall recovery rate, which includes a combination of what we collect in-house as well as what we sell, has been pretty consistent.

Our online and mobile purchase volume also continued its strong growth trajectory. Second quarter sales grew 27% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which have been in the 14% to 15% range. 
As for asset quality metrics, 30-plus-day delinquencies were 3.79%, compared to 3.53% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% in the second quarter of last year. 
Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 4% over last year, and were largely driven by the growth we are producing. We generated positive operating leverage, and our overall efficiency ratio improved 157 basis points to 31.9%. 
Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which increased $9 billion, or 23%, to $46 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources, and though this is slightly above our original target range of 60% to 70%, we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by offering competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite. 
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. Given our significant deposit growth, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5, well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.5% and liquid assets totaling $14 billion or 17% of total assets at quarter-end. The strength of our balance sheet and financial performance has enabled us to start returning capital to shareholders. As we announced earlier this month, our board approved a $0.13 quarterly dividend and a $952 million annual share repurchase program. We will now begin to opportunistically repurchase our stock and look forward to building on these actions as we look to deploy capital through both growth of the business and return to shareholders. 
Moving to business highlights. We recently renewed several key relationships including: Ashley Homestore, Suzuki, VCA Animal Hospitals and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. We also continue to sign new partnerships in the travel and entertainment space. We won a new U.S.-based program with Cathay Pacific Airways. We also signed a new program with Fareportal, one of the largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. These programs add to our growing T&E portfolio that already includes recently launched programs with Stash Hotel Rewards and Marvel Entertainment. 
The launch of our new program with Marvel this quarter includes an attractive cashback value proposition where the greatest benefits are accrued on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. 
We're excited about these new partnerships, as we believe this is a segment that provides attractive opportunities, and we are pleased to expand our presence in it. 
We also launched a new program with Mattress Firm, one of the nation's premier specialty bedding retailers. 
We continue to be highly focused on driving organic growth and pursuing new opportunities to grow our business. We are working closely with our current partners to deliver incremental value and drive program growth and provide value to our cardholders. 
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. 
Previously we had reported platform revenue. But starting with this quarter, we will utilize interest and fees on loans as a means of discussing our business performance, favoring this GAAP measure that more closely aligns with the growth metrics of our business. During the quarter we continued to drive growth by delivering value to our partners and cardholders via attractive value proposition, promotional financing and marketing offers. 
On the next slide I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continued to deliver growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the second quarter, as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card generated another strong quarter of results. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The strong growth in Retail Card continued to be broad-based, as we saw growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnerships with Cathay Pacific and Fareportal and the launch of the new Marvel program. We have developed strong long-term relationships that solidify our position in this space and provide the foundation for the addition of new partnerships and the expansion into new sectors, such as travel and entertainment. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 16% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest in fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. 
We had a very active quarter with the renewal of key relationships with Ashley Homestore and Suzuki and the launch of the Mattress Firm program. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions, which represented 26% of purchase volume in the second quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 5%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties, and we are pleased to renew an important veterinary partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals, as well as our strategic partnership with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card also continues to be an area of focus, and reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian, to provide the details on our results."
260334235,372214138,1011002,"Synchrony Financial, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchas",2073,"Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volume up 9%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 10%. Average active accounts increased 8% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year. 
The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $281 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth, which I will cover in more detail later. 
Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year and slightly better than 2Q '14 of 3.82%. The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year and 4.88% in 2Q '14. Delinquencies were consistent with the range we have seen in the second quarter over the past 2 years, with net charge-offs being lower than the range. 
Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.70%. As we noted in June, we expected the allowance to increase 20 to 30 basis points in the second quarter compared to the first quarter level of 5.5%. 
RSAs were up $43 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.1% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with the growth in the programs as well as the incremental reserve build, which more than offset incremental sharing on the year-over-year improvements in net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. Given the increase in the reserve level, we expect the RSA percentage on a full-year basis to trend closer to the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income decreased $37 million versus last year. In the prior year there was a $20 million gain on portfolio sales which did not repeat. The remainder of the decrease is attributable to higher loyalty and rewards costs that were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. While interchange was up $28 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our dual card, this was offset by loyalty expense that was up $41 million, primarily driven by new value propositions, including the Walmart 3-2-1 value prop. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $34 million or 4% versus last year. Now that we are comparing to periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth, as well as strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. 
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.9%, which was a 157 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and staying disciplined on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. 
Overall our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.4%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.86% for the quarter, up 9 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter, as we used excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. The yield on receivables declined 14 basis points to 21%, reflecting the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in promotional balances, particularly in Payment Solutions. 
The cost of funding was up 7 basis points to 1.9%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform, and deposits are now 71% of our funding versus 61% last year. The second quarter margin was 15.86%, which was 9 basis points better than last year and slightly better than the first quarter of 15.76%. And as we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect it to be fairly stable for the balance of the year. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance. 
Next I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. The backdrop for credit is still favorable. However, our forecast indicates that credit will gradually normalize higher from the recent lows. It's important to note that we are not seeing a step change. Our view takes into consideration factors like portfolio mix as well as account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. We consider all of these factors in our underwriting today, and we're still seeing very attractive returns across the credit spectrum. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.67% compared to 1.52% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. 
The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year and 4.88% in 2Q '14. The net charge-offs were somewhat lower than the range we had experienced over the past 2 years. 
The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.7% in the second quarter, in line with the range we provided in June. This results in the allowance coverage of approximately 13 to 15 months of expected charge-offs, which should be fairly consistent going forward. So as you think about credit normalization from here, we expect net charge-offs will be around 4.5% in 2016, which is largely in line with our guidance for the year. And we've indicated that we expect net charge-offs to trend 20 to 30 basis points higher over the next 4 quarters, which should be helpful as you think about 2017. 
So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment when it comes to credit, and the risk-adjusted yields we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $839 million for the quarter, a 4% increase over last year, and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $51 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under the GE TSA. 
Professional fees were down $2 million. This was primarily driven by growth in the business, which was more than offset by the reduction in third-party services mentioned previously, as well as expenses related to last year's EMV rollout, which did not repeat. 
Marketing and business development costs were down $1 million. Higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were offset by lower marketing costs related to our deposit platform as well as redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. 
Information processing was up $7 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. 
Other expenses down $21 million due to benefits from EMV as well as a reduction in TSA costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE. 
The efficiency ratio was 31.9% for the quarter, 157 basis points lower than last year, as the business drove positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses in the second half of the year as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, we expect it to remain below 34%, in line with what we communicated back in January. 
Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as recap our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved slightly over the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capability. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. 
We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products over the next couple years, such as checking and online bill pay. 
Funding for our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In May we successfully issued $600 million in 5-year fixed-rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources. This reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April, well ahead of the contractual maturity in 2019. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in May we did issue $500 million in 18-month floating-rate notes. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front, and overall we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.5% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 18% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 150 bps over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $21 billion and includes $14 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put as well above the required LCR levels. 
Before I wrap up, I wanted to recap our initial capital plan actions we announced on July 7. Our board approved a $0.13 quarterly common stock dividend as well as a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. We expect to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Our board also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on August 25 to holders of record at the close of business on August 12. 
Overall we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we're very pleased to be in a position to begin returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

Going forward and what was included in our guidance is that recoveries would be pretty similar to where they've been the last 2 years. So somewhere in that 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables. So that's really what was contemplated in the forward guidance. So no change to what we said in June. We gave you kind of what we think we're going to close the year at for 2016 at around 4.5%, and then starting kind of incremental year-over-year 20 to 30 basis points for the first quarter and the second quarter 2017."

You know, at that point we had paid down the bank term loans, so we were able to optimize liquidity a bit and take some of that excess and pay down the bank term loan. We're obviously really pleased with that. And we thought, jumping off from the first quarter, the margin would be pretty stable for the balance of the year, which was right around, I think, 15.75%. 
We still think that's a pretty good way to think about the back half of the year. If deposit growth continues at this pace, we'll get a small benefit there. We might be able to do a little bit more on liquidity, but probably not much. If you look at the year-over-year, we have been able to improve the yield that we're earning on the cash in the treasuries. But then there's some what I would call modest offsets to those 2 positives. One, we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. As you know, those are promotional balances, so those come on initially at a lower yield. And then our guidance initially back in January included a small benefit from another 50 basis points of fed rate increases in the back half of the year. And obviously now that looks a little bit less likely. So some -- a few puts and takes, I would say, but the margins should be pretty stable for the back half of the year."

So I guess, all else equal, that would probably -- in my math, that implies either a provision in the back half of this year that's similar to last year, or we get continued improvement in efficiency. So can you just maybe help us understand why the RSA would go back up to the second half of last year's level, given how much it's come down in the first half?

You also have to remember that we had -- a lot of things in the P&L got better year-over-year. So we had, obviously, better revenue. Margins were a little bit better. Efficiency ratio was better, as you indicated. So all else being equal, that would've resulted in a higher RSA percent compared to last year. And then those improvements were both more than offset by the higher reserve build and the higher provision. 
The one thing I'm not sure you're taking into account is, you think about the back half of the year, the third quarter is typically the high water mark on the RSA. We've got some seasonality. And if you look back over the past 2 years, you do see the RSA percentage trend up a bit in the third quarter seasonally. So as you think about the back half, you've got to factor that in.

Now we're giving you some broader context on some of the dynamics that we take into account when we build the forecast. And those are things like portfolio mix by platform, product, program, channel, as well as account maturation or seasoning of vintages as well as the overall consumer trends. 
I would say, if you look at seasoning of vintages for us, it absolutely plays out similarly in private label as it does for general purpose cards. So we typically see peak losses at around 24 months. I think that's pretty consistent with the rest of the industry. However, our growth rates have been more consistent than I think others. So while it certainly plays a factor in what we're seeing in our expectation, our growth rates haven't been perfectly consistent. So I'd say it's a factor, but it's not as significant, I think, for us as what you're seeing for others out there."

I think I've mentioned in past calls that we have dedicated resources in each of our 3 platforms. And I think you can tell by even this quarter we won some nice deals. We feel competitively, in the $500 million to $1 billion portfolio size, the competition is pretty reasonable, and we really compete effectively there. 
When you get to the bigger portfolios, obviously Costco is an example of that, it gets much more competitive. I would say, overall, on the bigger deals that are out there or people are discussing, I think we start by competing on our capabilities and the history and the level of experience that we have in the industry. And that's how most of these conversations start. I would say we generally win on those types of things. We feel that some of the things we've invested in, in the last couple of years, particularly around online and digital and mobile, are really playing to our advantage. We feel we're further ahead than the competition there. 
I think the other area that we're continuing to invest in is really the whole data analytics portion of the business and really leveraging some new technology there. So on a capability point of view I think we can -- we have a couple areas where we think we're a little ahead. We are very partner-focused, and I think the key relationships we have today really help reiterate with potential partners how we worked with our partners. And that, I think, is another advantage. So I think it's overall capabilities, experience and long-term relationships and partnerships that we have."

And for obvious reasons we can't provide any visibility around those contractual terms. And our retailers also have seasonality. And so there are a number of moving pieces that make it difficult for you to model it and to have that transparency, so we give you a guidance range for the year. 
What you should be able to see from the quarterly results is that when things get better we tend to share more; when things get worse we share less with the retail partners. That dynamic, whether you're looking at it as a percent of receivables or a percent of pretax earnings, excluding RSA, those ratios hold, I would say, fairly consistent but for the seasonal components that I mentioned.

What I would tell you is, we're very focused on driving operating leverage. You saw that in the first half of this year. It's a scalable business. I mentioned the infrastructure costs and the run rate earlier. We'll continue to drive operating leverage, but as we get more efficient across the business, we're always running productivity initiatives, and we're looking at moving more customers off of paper statements to online statements. We're improving our call center and collections efficiency metrics. And so we're working on eliminating waste in the back office, things like that. And that results in real operating leverage and real productivity. 
And then, in parallel with that, we look at things that we feel like we need to invest in to be a very successful business for the next 10 to 15 years.

I think the trends are and the commentary seems to be fairly consistent, which is that I think the backdrop is still pretty healthy. I think the consumer is still generally healthy. The overall macro environment is pretty strong. With that said, the consumer continues to take on more debt. They continue to take on more leverage. And while it appears to be modest and it looks like the overall levels are still pretty reasonable and pretty responsible, it's something we're watching carefully. I think others are watching it carefully as well. 
So our forecast includes that trend. It also includes the other factors that I mentioned: portfolio mix and mix by program and channel and other things. We believe this is going to result in a gradual increase in charge-offs over time. Some of that is seasoning. But as I mentioned earlier, I think seasoning, while everybody has, on a vintage, similar seasoning patterns, depending on the growth rates and the consistency of the growth rates, you could end up with a very different result, depending on the issuer. And so I think, while that is a factor we have certainly considered in our outlook, I think it plays maybe less of a role for us as it does with some others."

We're looking at some additional industries that we might want to expand in as well as -- our biggest opportunity, really, in CareCredit is just getting more of what's in a partner's office. So if you think of dental as an example, it's getting more of those patients who come in to utilize the payment methodology of CareCredit.

But I would not highlight them as being overly significant in terms of the overall results. They're things that we adapt to along with the rest of the industry, and we make other improvements to work, you know, offsets to those. 
In terms of recoveries, I would just reiterate what I said earlier. The overall recovery rate, which includes a combination of what we collect in-house as well as what we sell, has been pretty consistent. If you look over the past 2 years, it's been right around 1.1% to 1.2% of average receivables. It was a little bit higher this quarter.

That -- the forecast includes things like portfolio mix by platform, by product, program, channel.

And we're also factoring the trends that we are seeing on the consumer. And I would just reiterate what I said earlier, that the consumer, broadly, is still generally healthy. We said all last year that we didn't think the consumer would get better, and they continued to get better all last year. And now we're seeing those improvements subside, but the overall macro environment is still pretty strong. 
The thing that we're watching is the thing that I mentioned earlier, is that the consumer continues to take on more leverage. It appears to be responsible at this point. The overall levels are reasonable, if you look at them in a historic context. But it's something that we're watching carefully. And as we mentioned, we're watching what's going on in other asset classes as well and looking at the layered risks.

During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3. 
Second quarter net earnings totaled $489 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. Purchase volume grew 9%, loan receivables grew 11%, and net interest income grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. 
Our online and mobile purchase volume also continued its strong growth trajectory. Second quarter sales grew 27% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which have been in the 14% to 15% range. 
As for asset quality metrics, 30-plus-day delinquencies were 3.79%, compared to 3.53% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% in the second quarter of last year. 
Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 4% over last year, and were largely driven by the growth we are producing. We generated positive operating leverage, and our overall efficiency ratio improved 157 basis points to 31.9%. 
Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which increased $9 billion, or 23%, to $46 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources, and though this is slightly above our original target range of 60% to 70%, we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by offering competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite. 
One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. Given our significant deposit growth, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5, well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.5% and liquid assets totaling $14 billion or 17% of total assets at quarter-end. The strength of our balance sheet and financial performance has enabled us to start returning capital to shareholders. As we announced earlier this month, our board approved a $0.13 quarterly dividend and a $952 million annual share repurchase program. We will now begin to opportunistically repurchase our stock and look forward to building on these actions as we look to deploy capital through both growth of the business and return to shareholders. 
Moving to business highlights. We recently renewed several key relationships including: Ashley Homestore, Suzuki, VCA Animal Hospitals and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. We also continue to sign new partnerships in the travel and entertainment space. We won a new U.S.-based program with Cathay Pacific Airways. We also signed a new program with Fareportal, one of the largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. These programs add to our growing T&E portfolio that already includes recently launched programs with Stash Hotel Rewards and Marvel Entertainment. 
The launch of our new program with Marvel this quarter includes an attractive cashback value proposition where the greatest benefits are accrued on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. 
We're excited about these new partnerships as we believe this is a segment that provides attractive opportunities, and we are pleased to expand our presence in it. 
We also launched a new program with Mattress Firm, one of the nation's premier specialty bedding retailers. 
We continue to be highly focused on driving organic growth and pursuing new opportunities to grow our business. We are working closely with our current partners to deliver incremental value and drive program growth and provide value to our cardholders. 
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. 
Previously, we had reported platform revenue. But starting with this quarter, we will utilize interest and fees on loans as a means of discussing our business performance, favoring this GAAP measure that more closely aligns with the growth metrics of our business. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to our partners and cardholders via attractive value proposition, promotional financing and marketing offers. 
On the next slide I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continued to deliver growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the second quarter, as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card generated another strong quarter of results. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The strong growth in Retail Card continued to be broad-based as we saw growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnerships with Cathay Pacific and Fareportal and the launch of the new Marvel program. We have developed strong long-term relationships that solidify our position in this space and provide the foundation for the addition of new partnerships and the expansion into new sectors, such as travel and entertainment. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 16% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest in fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. 
We had a very active quarter with the renewal of key relationships with Ashley Homestore and Suzuki and the launch of the Mattress Firm program. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions, which represented 26% of purchase volume in the second quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 5%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties, and we are pleased to renew an important veterinary partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals, as well as our strategic partnership with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card also continues to be an area of focus, and reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian, to provide the details on our results."

In the second quarter, the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase volume up 9%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 10%. Average active accounts increased 8% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year. 
The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $281 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth, which I will cover in more detail later. 
Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year and slightly better than 2Q '14 of 3.82%. The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year and 4.88% in 2Q '14. Delinquencies were consistent with the range we have seen in the second quarter over the past 2 years, with net charge-offs being lower than the range. 
Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.70%. As we noted in June, we expected the allowance to increase 20 to 30 basis points in the second quarter compared to the first quarter level of 5.5%. 
RSAs were up $43 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.1% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with the growth in the programs as well as the incremental reserve build, which more than offset incremental sharing on the year-over-year improvements in net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. Given the increase in the reserve level, we expect the RSA percentage on a full year basis to trend closer to the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income decreased $37 million versus last year. In the prior year, there was a $20 million gain on portfolio sales which did not repeat. The remainder of the decrease is attributable to higher loyalty and rewards costs that were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. While interchange was up $28 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that was up $41 million, primarily driven by new value propositions, including the Walmart 3-2-1 value prop. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $34 million or 4% versus last year. Now that we are comparing to periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth, as well as strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. 
The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.9%, which was a 157 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and staying disciplined on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. 
Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.4%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.86% for the quarter, up 9 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter, as we used excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. The yield on receivables declined 14 basis points to 21%, reflecting the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in promotional balances, particularly in Payment Solutions. 
The cost of funding was up 7 basis points to 1.9%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform, and deposits are now 71% of our funding versus 61% last year. The second quarter margin was 15.86%, which was 9 basis points better than last year and slightly better than the first quarter of 15.76%. And as we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect it to be fairly stable for the balance of the year. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance. 
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. The backdrop for credit is still favorable. However, our forecast indicates that credit will gradually normalize higher from the recent lows. It's important to note that we are not seeing a step change. Our view takes into consideration factors like portfolio mix as well as account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. We consider all of these factors in our underwriting today, and we're still seeing very attractive returns across the credit spectrum. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.67% compared to 1.52% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. 
The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year and 4.88% in 2Q '14. The net charge-offs were somewhat lower than the range we had experienced over the past 2 years. 
The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.7% in the second quarter, in line with the range we provided in June. This results in the allowance coverage of approximately 13 to 15 months of expected charge-offs, which should be fairly consistent going forward. So as you think about credit normalization from here, we expect net charge-offs will be around 4.5% in 2016, which is largely in line with our guidance for the year. And we've indicated that we expect net charge-offs to trend 20 to 30 basis points higher over the next 4 quarters, which should be helpful as you think about 2017. 
So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment when it comes to credit, and the risk-adjusted yields we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $839 million for the quarter, a 4% increase over last year, and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $51 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under the GE TSA. 
Professional fees were down $2 million. This was primarily driven by growth in the business, which was more than offset by the reduction in third-party services mentioned previously, as well as expenses related to last year's EMV rollout, which did not repeat. 
Marketing and business development costs were down $1 million. Higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were offset by lower marketing costs related to our deposit platform as well as redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. 
Information processing was up $7 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. 
Other expenses, down $21 million due to benefits from EMV as well as a reduction in TSA costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE. 
The efficiency ratio was 31.9% for the quarter, 157 basis points lower than last year, as the business drove positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses in the second half of the year as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, we expect it to remain below 34%, in line with what we communicated back in January. 
Moving to Slide 10. I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as recap our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved slightly over the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capability. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. 
We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products over the next couple years, such as checking and online bill pay. 
Funding for our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In May, we successfully issued $600 million in 5-year fixed-rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources. This reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April, well ahead of the contractual maturity in 2019. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in May, we did issue $500 million in 18-month floating-rate notes. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front, and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.5% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 18% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 150 bps over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $21 billion and includes $14 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put as well above the required LCR levels. 
Before I wrap up, I wanted to recap our initial capital plan actions we announced on July 7. Our board approved a $0.13 quarterly common stock dividend as well as a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. We expect to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Our board also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on August 25 to holders of record at the close of business on August 12. 
Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we're very pleased to be in a position to begin returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

Going forward and what was included in our guidance is that recoveries would be pretty similar to where they've been the last 2 years. So somewhere in that 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables. So that's really what was contemplated in the forward guidance. So no change to what we said in June. We gave you kind of what we think we're going to close the year at, for 2016, at around 4.5%, and then starting kind of incremental year-over-year 20 to 30 basis points for the first quarter and the second quarter 2017."

At that point, we had paid down the bank term loans, so we were able to optimize liquidity a bit and take some of that excess and pay down the bank term loan. We're obviously really pleased with that. And we thought, jumping off from the first quarter, the margin would be pretty stable for the balance of the year, which was right around, I think, 15.75%. 
We still think that's a pretty good way to think about the back half of the year. If deposit growth continues at this pace, we'll get a small benefit there. We might be able to do a little bit more on liquidity, but probably not much. If you look at the year-over-year, we have been able to improve the yield that we're earning on the cash in the treasuries. But then there's some what I would call modest offsets to those 2 positives. One, we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. As you know, those are promotional balances, so those come on initially at a lower yield. And then our guidance initially back in January included a small benefit from another 50 basis points of fed rate increases in the back half of the year. And obviously now that looks a little bit less likely. So some -- a few puts and takes, I would say, but the margins should be pretty stable for the back half of the year."

So I guess, all else equal, that would probably -- in my math, that implies either a provision in the back half of this year that's similar to last year, or we get continued improvement in efficiency. So can you just maybe help us understand why the RSA would go back up to the second half of last year's level, given how much it's come down in the first half?

You also have to remember that we had -- a lot of things in the P&L got better year-over-year. So we had, obviously, better revenue. Margins were a little bit better. Efficiency ratio was better, as you indicated. So all else being equal, that would've resulted in a higher RSA percent compared to last year. And then those improvements were both more than offset by the higher reserve build and the higher provision. 
The one thing I'm not sure you're taking into account is, you think about the back half of the year, the third quarter is typically the high water mark on the RSA. We've got some seasonality. And if you look back over the past 2 years, you do see the RSA percentage trend up a bit in the third quarter seasonally. So as you think about the back half, you've got to factor that in. But that's all included in the outlook for the 4.2% to 4.3% for the year."

Now we're giving you some broader context on some of the dynamics that we take into account when we build the forecast. And those are things like portfolio mix by platform, product, program, channel, as well as account maturation or seasoning of vintages as well as the overall consumer trends. 
I would say, if you look at seasoning of vintages for us, it absolutely plays out similarly in private label as it does for general purpose cards. So we typically see peak losses at around 24 months. I think that's pretty consistent with the rest of the industry. However, our growth rates have been more consistent than, I think, others. So while it certainly plays a factor in what we're seeing in our expectation, our growth rates haven't been perfectly consistent.

We feel that some of the things we've invested in, in the last couple of years, particularly around online and digital and mobile, are really playing to our advantage. We feel we're further ahead than the competition there. 
I think the other area that we're continuing to invest in is really the whole data analytics portion of the business and really leveraging some new technology there.

We do more marketing and promotions in the second half of the year, particularly around holiday. And so that drives -- that will drive an increase in the efficiency ratio. And we also have more of our strategic investment spend stacked against the second half of the year as well.

That would suggest, assuming that there's a 50-50 share on the RSAs, that you would expect roughly a $50 million decline in RSA expense. We didn't see that. That wasn't our assumption either.

And part of the reason for that is that all of our deals are very unique, very customized, both in terms of the percentage sharing as well as the level at which we start to share with the retail partner. And for obvious reasons, we can't provide any visibility around those contractual terms. And our retailers also have seasonality. And so there are a number of moving pieces that make it difficult for you to model it and to have that transparency, so we give you a guidance range for the year. 
What you should be able to see from the quarterly results is that when things get better, we tend to share more; when things get worse, we share less with the retail partners. That dynamic, whether you're looking at it as a percent of receivables or a percent of pretax earnings, excluding RSA, those ratios hold, I would say, fairly consistent but for the seasonal components that I mentioned.

What I would tell you is, we're very focused on driving operating leverage. You saw that in the first half of this year. It's a scalable business. I mentioned the infrastructure costs and the run rate earlier. We'll continue to drive operating leverage, but as we get more efficient across the business, we're always running productivity initiatives, and we're looking at moving more customers off of paper statements to online statements. We're improving our call center and collections efficiency metrics. And so we're working on eliminating waste in the back office, things like that. And that results in real operating leverage and real productivity. 
And then, in parallel with that, we look at things that we feel like we need to invest in to be a very successful business for the next 10 to 15 years. And those are things that -- some of the things that Margaret talked about: investing in mobile capabilities, which is something we've been doing for 4 or 5 years; data analytics; CRM.

But even after you take those incremental investments into account, we would expect to and we would hope to continue to generate positive operating leverage. That doesn't mean we're going to generate positive operating leverage every quarter.

I think others are watching it carefully as well. 
So our forecast includes that trend. It also includes the other factors that I mentioned: portfolio mix and mix by program and channel and other things. We believe this is going to result in a gradual increase in charge-offs over time. Some of that is seasoning. But as I mentioned earlier, I think seasoning, while everybody has, on a vintage, similar seasoning patterns, depending on the growth rates and the consistency of the growth rates, you could end up with a very different result, depending on the issuer. And so I think, while that is a factor we have certainly considered in our outlook, I think it plays maybe less of a role for us as it does with some others."

So on the first one, I would say generally, we're always making improvements and refinements to our collection strategies.

So on the first one, I would say generally, we're always making improvements and refinements to our collection strategies. We're fully compliant with the applicable regulatory guidance, whether it's DCPA or whatever it is. And obviously, those have some impact on our ability to collect. But I would not highlight them as being overly significant in terms of the overall results. They're things that we adapt to along with the rest of the industry, and we make other improvements to work -- offsets to those. 
In terms of recoveries, I would just reiterate what I said earlier. The overall recovery rate, which includes a combination of what we collect in-house as well as what we sell, has been pretty consistent. If you look over the past 2 years, it's been right around 1.1% to 1.2% of average receivables. It was a little bit higher this quarter. We think it comes back down into that kind of 2-year average going forward."

So in June, our comments indicated that we were expecting to see this modest increase in net charge-offs over the next 12 months. To us, that's normalization. I think others may have viewed it differently. And as part of that dialogue, we focus more specifically around the payment behaviors that were driving the reserve build specifically in the quarter. That was the guidance we were providing. Now I think we're trying to give you some broader context on items in the forecast that obviously influence the forecast and items that drive some of that payment behavior that we're seeing. That -- the forecast includes things like portfolio mix by platform, by product, program, channel. While seasoning is not as big for us, as I mentioned, as I think it may be for some others, that's included in our outlook as well. 
And we're also factoring the trends that we are seeing on the consumer. And I would just reiterate what I said earlier, that the consumer, broadly, is still generally healthy. We said all last year that we didn't think the consumer would get better, and they continued to get better all last year. And now we're seeing those improvements subside, but the overall macro environment is still pretty strong. 
The thing that we're watching is the thing that I mentioned earlier, is that the consumer continues to take on more leverage. It appears to be responsible at this point. The overall levels are reasonable, if you look at them in a historic context. But it's something that we're watching carefully. And as we mentioned, we're watching what's going on in other asset classes as well and looking at the layered risks. So our forecast includes that trend continuing, as well as the items I mentioned earlier."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 mill",1389,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.
Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 million or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered strong growth in each of our sales platforms, driving double-digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. We also grew purchase volume 8% over the third quarter of last year. 
Looking specifically at our online and mobile purchase volume. Sales grew 26%. Our online and mobile sales growth has continued to far outpace U.S. growth trends, which have been around 15%. We remain focused on developing solutions to support this important sales channel. 
Looking at asset quality metrics. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% in the third quarter of last year. We continued our discipline on expenses, which increased only 2% over last year. The strong revenue growth and control over expenses helped generate positive operating leverage and drove our efficiency ratio down to 30.6% from 34.2% last year. 
Our growth was supported by another quarter of strong deposit generation, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $50 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. The number has been trending above our original target of 60% to 70%, but we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by focusing on competitive rates and outstanding customer service as well as the build-out of our product suite. 
Our balance sheet remained strong with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and liquid assets totaling $16 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter-end. We were pleased to initiate our capital plan in the third quarter. This quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased shares totaling $238 million. We are also deploying capital through our strong balance sheet growth. 
Organic growth is the most significant driver of our performance and continues to be our biggest opportunity. This quarter, we renewed several key partnerships, including TJX Companies, a strong-performing program and great partnership. Cardholders can continue to access royalty rewards, mobile account management and other exclusive benefits with cards which can be used at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores as well as through online. 
We also extended our 17-year partnership with hhgregg, a leading specialty retail of home appliances, televisions, consumer electronics and home furnishings. Through our partnership, cardholders will be able to continue to access special financing offers, in-store and online deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits when using their hhgregg cards in their 220 stores.
And we renewed our partnership with Nationwide Marketing Group, North America's largest buying and marketing organization. They work beside thousands of appliance, furniture, electronics and other dealers to help them grow their business. And we are happy to continue to provide consumer financing through this group. We are also pleased to have renewed an important endorsement by the American Dental Association. Endorsements are an integral part to helping us to extend the reach of our CareCredit platform. 
We also continue to sign new partnerships. We signed a long-term agreement with Nissan to introduce a new co-branded consumer credit program. The program will be offered through Nissan and Infiniti dealerships in the U.S. as well as online. It will provide Nissan and Infiniti credit cardholders with offers, rewards and exclusive benefits. In addition, we reached an agreement with At Home, a big-box specialty retailer of home decor products to introduce a new consumer financing program. At Home cardholders will be able to take advantage of promotional financing offers on qualifying purchases, exclusive discounts, loyalty rewards and other benefits, including mobile account servicing. 
We launched a new program with The Container Store. The Container Store private-label credit card offers financing options for the purchase of the retailers' more than 11,000 products, customized variety of services and organization solutions. We also launched a new program with the Google Store, which was announced in conjunction with Google's release of their new Pixel phone. We are partnered with Google to launch Google Store Financing, where we provide financing for their new hardware products, including the Pixel, Google Home, Daydream View VR headsets, Chromecast Ultra and Google Wifi. We had a very strong program launch and are excited about the prospects of this new partner and program. 
We remain focused on pursuing new, profitable opportunities to grow our business, although organic growth remains our biggest opportunity. And as such, we are working closely within our partners to continue to deliver leading-edge capabilities, value, increased penetration and to drive program growth.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans grew 12% over the third quarter of last year. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to partners and cardholders via attractive value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers. On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms.
We continued to generate strong growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter of strong results. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 7% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad-based growth across Retail Card partner programs continued in the third quarter. 
As I noted earlier, we renewed TJX Companies, a key partnership for us. We also signed 2 new relationships with Nissan and At Home and launched a new Google Store program during the quarter. Our long-tenured relationships are an important part of our story. We are able to leverage the expertise we have developed over the decades of running this business into our platform that attracts new, important partners such as Nissan and Google. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 14% was driven by purchase volume growth of 14% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivable with home furnishings, automotive products and power leading the way.
We renewed several Payment Solutions relationships this quarter, including hhgregg and Nationwide Marketing Group. This quarter, we also extended our relationship with Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. to continue providing consumer financing for powersports products distributed by KMC through a network of approximately 1,100 independent retailers. Qualifying buyers will have access to special financing options for Kawasaki products from Synchrony. And we also launched the new program with The Container Store during the quarter. Repeat usage continues to be strong across Payment Solutions, representing 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. 
In addition to the renewal of a key endorsement with the American Dental Association, we also announced program renewals with 4 prominent dental organizations. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary area of focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive a reuse rate of 52% of purchase volume in the quarter. 
We are also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter, we introduced CareCredit Direct, a private and secure platform wherein patients can apply for financing privately at the health care provider practice, get a credit decision while they are there, and if approved, use their CareCredit card to pay for the services that day. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."

In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 12%. 
Average active account increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see positive trends in average balances and spend with growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 1% over last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $284 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve billed and receivables growth.  
Regarding asset quality metrics. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.82% compared to 5.31% last year. The asset quality metrics, which I'll cover in more detail later, reflect the gradual pace of normalization that we had highlighted last quarter. 
RSAs were up $34 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.3% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailer sharing in the incremental provision expense, which more than offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year improvement on net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. We continue to expect the RSA percentage on a full year basis to trend towards the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income was flat versus last year. While interchange was up $19 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $23 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $16 million or 2% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms and enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, which was a 362 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth in the business and maintaining discipline on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.8%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.27% for the quarter, up 30 basis points over last year. 
As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. We are also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth.
The yield on receivables increased 13 basis points to 21.58%, driven by a slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year. We typically see the revolve rate increase in the third quarter. We also benefited, to a degree, from the prime rate being higher compared to the prior year. These benefits more than offset the impact of a slight mix shift due to continued strong growth in lower-yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The platforms receivables have grown on average 15% compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 9% to 10% range over the past year. The cost of funding was up 3 basis points to 1.85% due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates.
Our deposit base increased by $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. The cost of our deposit base is lower than alternative forms of funding, such as wholesale funding. And we are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform and increasing the mix of funding coming from deposits. Deposits are 71% of our funding versus 63% last year. 
As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margin and expect the net interest margin to decline back into the 15.9% range due primarily to the seasonal buildup in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall, the credit environment remains favorable, and we continue to see significant growth opportunities at attractive risk-adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past 2 years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually over time. Our view on credit takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.89% compared to 1.73% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. The net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year, consistent with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.82% in the third quarter, which was largely in line with our expectations. The reserve build reflects the growth in the portfolio, the normalization of net charge-offs as well as lower recovery pricing, which we believe is partly attributable to the new proposed regulations around third-party collectors.
Part of the increase in credit costs is offset to our retailer share arrangements and is reflected in the decline of the RSAs as a percent of average receivables to 4.3% this quarter compared to 4.6% last year. This is also reflected in our full year guidance for the RSAs, which is now 4.2% to 4.3%. 
Looking to the fourth quarter. We typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and given the seasonal build in receivables, we expect to see a modest decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables. However, given the normalization trends, this decline is likely to be smaller than it has been in the past 2 years. 
We continue to expect net charge-offs to be around 4.5% for 2016, which is in line with our guidance for the year. We will provide a full year view on 2017 in conjunction with the outlook we'll provide in January. So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment and the risk-adjusted returns we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9. I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $859 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $43 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. 
Professional fees were up $12 million. This is primarily driven by growth in the business and certain third-party services. Marketing and business development costs were down $23 million. Higher costs, driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were more than offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Lastly, given our strong growth in deposits, we were able to reduce some of the marketing costs associated with that platform. 
Information processing was up $10 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expense was down $26 million due to a reduction in costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE, as well as benefits derived from EMV in the form of lower fraud expense. 
The efficiency ratio was 30.6% for the quarter, 362 basis points lower than last year, as the business continued to generate significant positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Year-to-date, the efficiency ratio was 31%, 236 basis points lower than the same period in 2015. We expect the ratio to trend up in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses during the holiday season as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, given the strong start to the year, we do expect the ratio to be around 32% for the full year 2016, well below the guidance we provided in January.
Moving to Slide 10. I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as summarize our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. 
Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Our retention rate on our deposits has consistently been in the 88% to 89% range over the past couple of years. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In September, we successfully issued just over $750 million in 3-year fixed rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. 
Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets. And in August, we did issue a total of $700 million in senior unsecured debt, $500 million in 10-year fixed rate notes and $200 million of floating rate notes that mature in November 2017. So another fairly active quarter on issuance. And overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 120 basis points over the past year. 
Total liquidity increased to $24 billion and includes $16.4 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.1 billion undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach. And these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.
During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased $238 million of common stock out of the $952 million our board authorized through the fourth quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. 
Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

Our capital and liquidity position also remained strong. And we were pleased to commence the payment of a dividend and also repurchase shares during the quarter. 
I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A."

So if you look back over the past few years and you look at the receivable yield from the third to the fourth, it generally comes down in the fourth quarter, given you're building a lot of receivables obviously for holiday and the fact that they don't generate finance charge yields in the quarter. So it's really that seasonal trend that's driving the forecast in the fourth quarter. The other dynamics are relatively stable. I think if you look at margins more generally, we've been very pleased all year with the margins and the way that they have performed. If you remember back in January, we thought NIM was going to be around 15.5%. We kind of revised that guidance to 15.75%, something in that range. After we saw the strong deposit growth, that obviously is continuing. And then we were able to improve the yield on the liquidity portfolio and also really optimized the amount of liquidity that we're holding. So all those things, all else being equal, should continue to flow through. And we think those will flow through to the fourth quarter. That's why we kind of guided to the -- we took the guidance up from 15.75% for the year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter, which should put you around somewhere around 15.9% for the year. So overall, we've -- I think we've performed very well on margins relative to what we thought back in January."

But in addition to that growth-driven building, we've had kind of the normalization effect also driving building. And so when we kind of go from the low of 5.12% allowance, gradually rising to kind of 5.8%, that credit normalization effect has also driven some building. So kind of as we extend out the thinking of credit continuing to normalize over the next several quarters, for modeling purposes, is it kind of reasonable to expect that we kind of move in to kind of like a 6 handle, and gradually, as we get over the next several quarters into 2017 that, that number continues to rise?

So I would say, generally, the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember, we gave you a range of 5.7% to 5.8%. And last quarter, we were right at 5.7%, and this quarter, we came in at 5.82%. So better-than-expected growth drove a big chunk of that reserve build in the quarter. I think just in the quarter and last 90 days, we had a $2.4 billion receivables. The recovery assumption that I mentioned earlier, that drove about $36 million of the build in the quarter, which is about 5 basis points of covered. So if you adjust for that, the cover would have been around 5.77%, so right in the middle of that range that we provided. And if you think about -- and maybe it's helpful just to break down the reserve build in the quarter a little bit. And this is not -- just to be clear, this is not how we calculate the reserve, but it gives you a way to think about the different pieces. So if you take that $2.4 billion of receivables growth in the quarter, you need to take that at the old covered rate of 5.7%, that gives you a build of about $135 million of the 2 21 [ph], right?  And then you've got the coverage rate increase by 12 basis points, which is about $86 million. And if you break that down into 2 pieces, you've got the $36 million for the recovery pricing that I mentioned, and then you've got about about $50 million or about 7 basis points as really for that normalization effect that we're seeing in the book over the next 12 months. So hopefully that gives you some pieces and a way to think about it going forward."

And at least in terms of the margins and efficiency ratio, we think that carries through to the fourth quarter, but for the seasonal elements that I mentioned earlier. And so all of those positive dynamics in the business pushed the RSA higher, right? And then those improvements in the quarter and our expectation going forward, there's going to be an offset there for the incremental provision.

But look, I think, generally, we've been very pleased with the growth that we've had all year. We've got receivables growth of 11%. We guided early in the year to 7 to 9. So we're obviously tracking well ahead of the guidance we put out there in January. And when you look at the underlying growth drivers, they're all pretty strong. When you look up at purchase per average active account was up, average balances per active account were up. We really measure, as opposed to new accounts, what's really a more important measure for us is active accounts. Private label and our Dual Card really trying to move that more towards the top of [indiscernible] card and get that usage and get that repeat purchases. And so if you look at the last 2 or 3 years and just compare that to the average active account growth in last few quarters, we're up 7%. That growth has accelerated, which is a really positive dynamic for us. So I think, there's really good evidence, good indicators of the consumers are spending more. They're seeing real value number card. The things we've done around the value proposition, Amazon and Walmart. We can announce another one like Guitar Center come that's all really paying off. And then if you look at some of the additional things that we track and talk to you about, online and mobile were up 26% in the quarter. That compares to about 15% for the industry. The reuse that we're getting in CareCredit was up year-over-year. It was 52% versus 50% a year ago. And we're bringing on new partners. We're bringing on new partners. I would say, the majority of those are startup programs, so those aren't really influencing the  growth that we've had so far year-to-date. And so to the second part of your question, most of the growth is really organic growth. It's driving that increased penetration. That's something that, obviously, we track by program. It's how we measure our team. It's all we focus on. And that's the way to really grow 11% in the retail environment that's growing 2% to 3%, and that's been pretty consistent. And our growth rates have been pretty consistent over the past 5 years. So I think we feel really good about, overall, the fundamentals that we're seeing on growth.

So this a big opportunity for us as we move forward and continue to work. What I would say is on the mobile world in general and online world in general, there's a lot higher engagement across all our partners right now in this particular area as they're all really coming to terms with the fact that they have to be best-in-class.

Obviously, we sell a portion of our charge-offs to third parties, and we believe that the pricing that we're seeing in the market right now is somewhat influenced by these new proposals. So the proposals include things like more documentation, more work for the third party to substantiate the data at each stage of the collection process, reduce contact, other call restrictions, things like that, additional disclosures. And so a lot of these things aren't finalized at this point, but I think people are anticipating that at a minimum, it's going to be a little more difficult, a lot more expensive based on these new proposals, and they're building that into their pricing. And so as we started to see that right around the August time frame, we built that into the reserve model, and that's driving, what I would call, relatively modest impact of 5 basis points on the coverage."

But what I would say is that it's definitely shifting, and each quarter, we see incremental growth online and digital. As we stated, our online sales were up 26% over last year, and that continues to grow every single quarter. About 1/3 of our applications occurred digitally. We have -- we've received about 12 million mobile applications since we've launched in 2012. That's growing at about 80% year-over-year. So that's the growth channel for us that, I think, you're going to continue to see expanding. And yes, we're seeing faster growth in the industry so I think, the important part of digital and online is really our ability to continue to integrate with our partners. And so one of the things we're really working hard on now, obviously, we've done Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and those things. We have digital cards on our own. What we're seeing now is more and more retailers are trading their own apps, and we're really trying to work to be in that app so it's a really seamless and frictionless process for the customer as they're shopping around on a mobile app of a particular retailer. So I think you're going to see as focusing even more on that as the retailers come to us and ask us to really engage at a much higher level. That's my point earlier. I think that there's been a little bit of, I think, a shift in terms of how retailers are even think about mobile and putting a lot more emphasis on effort there. And that's where we're very highly engaged right now across all 3 platforms really."

We've obviously introduced many new value propositions over the past year, and we introduced the Sam's Club, 5-3-1; Amazon Prime, 5%. We've got new programs at Chevron and BP, new value proposition at Walmart, the 3-2-1. So all of those are obviously influencing both the interchange and the loyalty lines that you see. And generally, more loyalties is a good thing. It means we're growing our receivables, we're generating finance charge revenue. The lines also run back to the RSAs, so there's an offset there. And if you're looking at just the relationship between loyalty and interchange, the one thing I would just point out is this is very different than general-purpose card. Given we have significant value propositions like Amazon where we don't charge interchange but we still offer a very attractive value proposition, we'd expect to see loyalty increases as a percentage of interchange going forward. That's -- we really don't look at those lines in isolation. We really measure them on kind of the context of overall deal structure. So look, if we have the opportunity to launch a better value proposition that's going to drive more usage on the card, generate strong receivables growth, that's a good thing for us. It's a good thing for our partners, and it really comes down to that shared economic model."

We're always working to get more efficient across the business. We always start the year with a bunch of productivity initiatives, cutting out waste in the business, getting more efficient, moving more online, off the paper.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 mill",1389,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.
Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 million or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered strong growth in each of our sales platforms, driving double-digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. We also grew purchase volume 8% over the third quarter of last year. 
Looking specifically at our online and mobile purchase volume. Sales grew 26%. Our online and mobile sales growth has continued to far outpace U.S. growth trends, which have been around 15%. We remain focused on developing solutions to support this important sales channel. 
Looking at asset quality metrics. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% in the third quarter of last year. We continued our discipline on expenses, which increased only 2% over last year. The strong revenue growth and control over expenses helped generate positive operating leverage and drove our efficiency ratio down to 30.6% from 34.2% last year. 
Our growth was supported by another quarter of strong deposit generation, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $50 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. The number has been trending above our original target of 60% to 70%, but we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by focusing on competitive rates and outstanding customer service as well as the build-out of our product suite. 
Our balance sheet remained strong with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and liquid assets totaling $16 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter-end. We were pleased to initiate our capital plan in the third quarter. This quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased shares totaling $238 million. We are also deploying capital through our strong balance sheet growth. 
Organic growth is the most significant driver of our performance and continues to be our biggest opportunity. This quarter, we renewed several key partnerships, including TJX Companies, a strong-performing program and great partnership. Cardholders can continue to access royalty rewards, mobile account management and other exclusive benefits with cards which can be used at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores as well as through online. 
We also extended our 17-year partnership with hhgregg, a leading specialty retail of home appliances, televisions, consumer electronics and home furnishings. Through our partnership, cardholders will be able to continue to access special financing offers, in-store and online deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits when using their hhgregg cards in their 220 stores.
And we renewed our partnership with Nationwide Marketing Group, North America's largest buying and marketing organization. They work beside thousands of appliance, furniture, electronics and other dealers to help them grow their business. And we are happy to continue to provide consumer financing through this group. We are also pleased to have renewed an important endorsement by the American Dental Association. Endorsements are an integral part to helping us to extend the reach of our CareCredit platform. 
We also continue to sign new partnerships. We signed a long-term agreement with Nissan to introduce a new co-branded consumer credit program. The program will be offered through Nissan and Infiniti dealerships in the U.S. as well as online. It will provide Nissan and Infiniti credit cardholders with offers, rewards and exclusive benefits. In addition, we reached an agreement with At Home, a big-box specialty retailer of home decor products to introduce a new consumer financing program. At Home cardholders will be able to take advantage of promotional financing offers on qualifying purchases, exclusive discounts, loyalty rewards and other benefits, including mobile account servicing. 
We launched a new program with The Container Store. The Container Store private-label credit card offers financing options for the purchase of the retailers' more than 11,000 products, customized variety of services and organization solutions. We also launched a new program with the Google Store, which was announced in conjunction with Google's release of their new Pixel phone. We are partnered with Google to launch Google Store Financing, where we provide financing for their new hardware products, including the Pixel, Google Home, Daydream View VR headsets, Chromecast Ultra and Google Wifi. We had a very strong program launch and are excited about the prospects of this new partner and program. 
We remain focused on pursuing new, profitable opportunities to grow our business, although organic growth remains our biggest opportunity. And as such, we are working closely within our partners to continue to deliver leading-edge capabilities, value, increased penetration and to drive program growth.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans grew 12% over the third quarter of last year. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to partners and cardholders via attractive value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers. On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms.
We continued to generate strong growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter of strong results. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 7% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad-based growth across Retail Card partner programs continued in the third quarter. 
As I noted earlier, we renewed TJX Companies, a key partnership for us. We also signed 2 new relationships with Nissan and At Home and launched a new Google Store program during the quarter. Our long-tenured relationships are an important part of our story. We are able to leverage the expertise we have developed over the decades of running this business into our platform that attracts new, important partners such as Nissan and Google. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 14% was driven by purchase volume growth of 14% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivable with home furnishings, automotive products and power leading the way.
We renewed several Payment Solutions relationships this quarter, including hhgregg and Nationwide Marketing Group. This quarter, we also extended our relationship with Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. to continue providing consumer financing for powersports products distributed by KMC through a network of approximately 1,100 independent retailers. Qualifying buyers will have access to special financing options for Kawasaki products from Synchrony. And we also launched the new program with The Container Store during the quarter. Repeat usage continues to be strong across Payment Solutions, representing 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. 
In addition to the renewal of a key endorsement with the American Dental Association, we also announced program renewals with 4 prominent dental organizations. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary area of focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive a reuse rate of 52% of purchase volume in the quarter. 
We are also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter, we introduced CareCredit Direct, a private and secure platform wherein patients can apply for financing privately at the health care provider practice, get a credit decision while they are there, and if approved, use their CareCredit card to pay for the services that day. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."
260334235,403884546,1058648,"Synchrony Financial, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase",2149,"Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 12%. 
Average active account increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see positive trends in average balances and spend with growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 1% over last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $284 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve billed and receivables growth.  
Regarding asset quality metrics. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.82% compared to 5.31% last year. The asset quality metrics, which I'll cover in more detail later, reflect the gradual pace of normalization that we had highlighted last quarter. 
RSAs were up $34 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.3% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailer sharing in the incremental provision expense, which more than offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year improvement on net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. We continue to expect the RSA percentage on a full year basis to trend towards the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income was flat versus last year. While interchange was up $19 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $23 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $16 million or 2% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms and enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, which was a 362 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth in the business and maintaining discipline on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.8%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.27% for the quarter, up 30 basis points over last year. 
As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. We are also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth.
The yield on receivables increased 13 basis points to 21.58%, driven by a slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year. We typically see the revolve rate increase in the third quarter. We also benefited, to a degree, from the prime rate being higher compared to the prior year. These benefits more than offset the impact of a slight mix shift due to continued strong growth in lower-yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The platforms receivables have grown on average 15% compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 9% to 10% range over the past year. The cost of funding was up 3 basis points to 1.85% due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates.
Our deposit base increased by $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. The cost of our deposit base is lower than alternative forms of funding, such as wholesale funding. And we are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform and increasing the mix of funding coming from deposits. Deposits are 71% of our funding versus 63% last year. 
As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margin and expect the net interest margin to decline back into the 15.9% range due primarily to the seasonal buildup in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall, the credit environment remains favorable, and we continue to see significant growth opportunities at attractive risk-adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past 2 years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually over time. Our view on credit takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.89% compared to 1.73% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. The net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year, consistent with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.82% in the third quarter, which was largely in line with our expectations. The reserve build reflects the growth in the portfolio, the normalization of net charge-offs as well as lower recovery pricing, which we believe is partly attributable to the new proposed regulations around third-party collectors.
Part of the increase in credit costs is offset to our retailer share arrangements and is reflected in the decline of the RSAs as a percent of average receivables to 4.3% this quarter compared to 4.6% last year. This is also reflected in our full year guidance for the RSAs, which is now 4.2% to 4.3%. 
Looking to the fourth quarter. We typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and given the seasonal build in receivables, we expect to see a modest decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables. However, given the normalization trends, this decline is likely to be smaller than it has been in the past 2 years. 
We continue to expect net charge-offs to be around 4.5% for 2016, which is in line with our guidance for the year. We will provide a full year view on 2017 in conjunction with the outlook we'll provide in January. So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment and the risk-adjusted returns we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9. I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $859 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $43 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. 
Professional fees were up $12 million. This is primarily driven by growth in the business and certain third-party services. Marketing and business development costs were down $23 million. Higher costs, driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were more than offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Lastly, given our strong growth in deposits, we were able to reduce some of the marketing costs associated with that platform. 
Information processing was up $10 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expense was down $26 million due to a reduction in costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE, as well as benefits derived from EMV in the form of lower fraud expense. 
The efficiency ratio was 30.6% for the quarter, 362 basis points lower than last year, as the business continued to generate significant positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Year-to-date, the efficiency ratio was 31%, 236 basis points lower than the same period in 2015. We expect the ratio to trend up in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses during the holiday season as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, given the strong start to the year, we do expect the ratio to be around 32% for the full year 2016, well below the guidance we provided in January.
Moving to Slide 10. I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as summarize our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. 
Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Our retention rate on our deposits has consistently been in the 88% to 89% range over the past couple of years. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In September, we successfully issued just over $750 million in 3-year fixed rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. 
Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets. And in August, we did issue a total of $700 million in senior unsecured debt, $500 million in 10-year fixed rate notes and $200 million of floating rate notes that mature in November 2017. So another fairly active quarter on issuance. And overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 120 basis points over the past year. 
Total liquidity increased to $24 billion and includes $16.4 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.1 billion undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach. And these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.
During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased $238 million of common stock out of the $952 million our board authorized through the fourth quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. 
Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

So if you look back over the past few years and you look at the receivable yield from the third to the fourth, it generally comes down in the fourth quarter, given you're building a lot of receivables obviously for holiday and the fact that they don't generate finance charge yields in the quarter. So it's really that seasonal trend that's driving the forecast in the fourth quarter. The other dynamics are relatively stable. I think if you look at margins more generally, we've been very pleased all year with the margins and the way that they have performed. If you remember back in January, we thought NIM was going to be around 15.5%. We kind of revised that guidance to 15.75%, something in that range. After we saw the strong deposit growth, that obviously is continuing. And then we were able to improve the yield on the liquidity portfolio and also really optimized the amount of liquidity that we're holding. So all those things, all else being equal, should continue to flow through. And we think those will flow through to the fourth quarter. That's why we kind of guided to the -- we took the guidance up from 15.75% for the year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter, which should put you around somewhere around 15.9% for the year. So overall, we've -- I think we've performed very well on margins relative to what we thought back in January."

I think we've done a really nice job this year using the excess liquidity from the strong deposit growth to pay down the bank term loan. I think we feel good about what we've done year-to-date. We're getting more yields on the cash and securities that we're holding. But I would say anything there is going to -- anything additional is going to be pretty modest going forward."

So clearly, the very strong loan growth that we've been seeing has been driving reserve building. But in addition to that growth-driven building, we've had kind of the normalization effect also driving building. And so when we kind of go from the low of 5.12% allowance, gradually rising to kind of 5.8%, that credit normalization effect has also driven some building. So kind of as we extend out the thinking of credit continuing to normalize over the next several quarters, for modeling purposes, is it kind of reasonable to expect that we kind of move into kind of like a 6% handle and gradually, as we get over the next several quarters into 2017, that, that number continues to rise? Or does that kind of flatten out at some point, where normalization is kind of achieved? Just trying to get a sense for how to think about that."

Let me just kind of break down the reserve build in the quarter. So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember, we gave you a range of 5.7% to 5.8%. And last quarter, we were right",315,"Yes. Sure, Bill. Let me just kind of break down the reserve build in the quarter. So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember, we gave you a range of 5.7% to 5.8%. And last quarter, we were right at 5.7%. And this quarter, we came in at 5.82%. So better-than-expected growth drove a big chunk of that reserve build in the quarter. I think just in the quarter and last 90 days, we had a $2.4 billion in receivables. The recovery assumption that I mentioned earlier, that drove about $36 million of the build in the quarter, which is about 5 basis points of coverage. So if you adjust for that, the coverage would have been around 5.77%, so right in the middle of that range that we provided. And if you think about -- and maybe it's helpful just to break down the reserve build in the quarter a little bit. And this is not -- just to be clear, this is not how we calculate the reserve, but it gives you a way to think about the different pieces. So if you take that $2.4 billion of receivables growth in the quarter and you just take that at the old coverage rate of 5.7%, that gives you a build of about $135 million of the $221 million, right? And then you've got the coverage rate increase by 12 basis points, which is about $86 million. And if you break that down into 2 pieces, you've got the $36 million for the recovery pricing that I mentioned, and then you've got about $50 million or about 7 basis points as really for that normalization effect that we're seeing in the book over the next 12 months. So hopefully that gives you some pieces and a way to think about it going forward."

Most of the more meaningful proposals, I think, will be adopted after the 2017 cycle, so we'll have to see kind of what gets finalized. But clearly, the removal of the qualitative task for smaller financial institutions, I think that's helpful. The treatment of dividends, clearly the RWA assumption, those are all helpful. But it's really hard to assess an impact until some of these things get finalized but I think directionally headed the right way for us."

We're really looking at building out data lakes and a CRM capability that goes well beyond just data for growing but also from a productivity perspective and really enhancing the whole wing-to-wing experience from our customer, from the time they apply for credit all the way through to servicing. And we have a pretty big cross-functional team working on a number of initiatives around data analytics. I believe and I think as our partners continue to look at ways to create more loyalty with their customers, this is going to be an important element of what we can bring to our partners, combining that with the digital experience that our customers are starting to go through and really that area growing exponentially.

And at least in terms of the margins and efficiency ratio, we think that carries through to the fourth quarter but for the seasonal elements that I mentioned earlier. And so all of those positive dynamics in the business pushed the RSA higher, right? And then those improvements in the quarter and our expectation going forward, there's going to be an offset there for the incremental provisions.

But look, I think, generally we've been very pleased with the growth that we've had all year. We've got receivables growth of 11%. We guided early in the year to 7% to 9%. So we're obviously tracking well ahead of the guidance we put out there in January. And I think when you look at the underlying growth drivers, they're all pretty strong. When you look at purchase volume per average active account was up, average balances per active account were up. We really measure -- as opposed to new accounts, what's really a more important measure for us is active accounts as with private label and our Dual Card, really trying to move that more towards the top of wallet card and get that usage and get that repeat purchases. And so if you look at the last 2 or 3 years and just compare that to the average active account growth in the last few quarters, we're up 7%. That growth has accelerated, which is a really positive dynamic for us. So I think there's really good evidence, good indicators that the consumers are spending more. They're seeing real value on our cards. The things we've done around the value propositions at Amazon and Walmart. We just announced another one at Guitar Center, those are really paying off. And then if you look at some of the additional things that we track and talk to you about, online and mobile were up 26% in the quarter. That compares to about 15% for the industry. The reuse that we're getting in CareCredit was up year-over-year. It was 52% versus 50% a year ago. And we're bringing on new partners. We're bringing on new partners. I would say the majority of those are start-up programs though, so those aren't really influencing the growth that we've had so far year-to-date. And so to the second part of your question, most of the growth is really organic growth. It's driving that increased penetration. That's something that obviously we track by program. It's how we measure our team. It's all we focus on. And that's the only way to really grow 11% in a retail environment that's growing 2% to 3%. And that's been pretty consistent. And our growth rates have been pretty consistent over the past 5 years. So I think we feel really good about, overall, the fundamentals that we're seeing on growth.

And obviously, we sell a portion of our charge-offs to third parties. And we believe that the pricing that we're seeing in the market right now is somewhat influenced by these new proposals. So the proposals include things like more documentation, more work for the third parties to substantiate their data at each stage of the collection process, reduce contact, other call restrictions, things like that, additional disclosures. And so a lot of these things aren't finalized at this point. But I think people are anticipating that at a minimum, it's going to be a little more difficult, a little more expensive based on these new proposals. And they're building that into their pricing. And so as we started to see that right around the August time frame, we built that into the reserve model. And that's driving the, what I would call, relatively modest impact of 5 basis points on the coverage."

And each quarter, we see incremental growth on online and digital. As we stated, our online sales were up 26% over last year. And that continues to grow every single quarter. About 1/3 of our applications occur digitally. We have received about 12 million mobile applications since we've launched in 2012. And that's growing at about 80% year-over-year. So that's a big growth channel for us that, I think, you're going to continue to see expanding. And yes, we're seeing faster growth in the industry. So I think the important part of digital and online is really our ability to continue to integrate with our partners. And so one of the things we're really working hard on now, obviously we've done Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and those things. We have digital cards on our own. What we're seeing now is more and more retailers are creating their own apps. And we're really trying to work to be in that app so that it's a really seamless and frictionless process for the customer as they're shopping around on a mobile app of a particular retailer. So I think you're going to see us focusing even more on that as the retailers come to us and ask us to really engage at a much higher level. That's my point earlier. I think there's been a little bit of, I think, a shift in terms of how retailers are even thinking about mobile and putting a lot more emphasis and effort there. And that's where we are very highly engaged right now across all 3 platforms really."

We've obviously introduced many new value propositions over the past year. We introduced the Sam's Club, 5-3-1, Amazon Prime, 5%. We've got new programs at Chevron and BP, new value proposition at Walmart, the 3-2-1. So all of those are obviously influencing both the interchange and the loyalty lines that you see. And generally, more loyalty is a good thing. It means we're growing our receivables. We're generating finance charge revenue. The lines also run back to the RSA, so there's an offset there. And if you're looking at just the relationship between loyalty and interchange, the one thing I would just point out is this is very different than general purpose card. Given we have significant value propositions, like Amazon where we don't charge interchange, but we still offer a very attractive value proposition, we'd expect to see loyalty increase as a percentage of interchange going forward. We really don't look at those lines in isolation. We really measure them kind of in the context of the overall deal structure. So look, if we have the opportunity to launch a better value proposition that's going to drive more usage on the card, generate strong receivables growth, that's a good thing for us. It's a good thing for our partners. And it really comes down to that shared economic model."

Now that the infrastructure costs are in the run rate, we would expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long run. We're always working to get more efficient across the business. We always start the year with a bunch of productivity initiatives, cutting out waste in the business, getting more efficient, moving more online, off the paper.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results.

During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.
Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 million or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered strong growth in each of our sales platforms, driving double-digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. We also grew purchase volume 8% over the third quarter of last year. 
Looking specifically at our online and mobile purchase volume. Sales grew 26%. Our online and mobile sales growth has continued to far outpace U.S. growth trends, which have been around 15%. We remain focused on developing solutions to support this important sales channel. 
Looking at asset quality metrics. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% in the third quarter of last year. We continued our discipline on expenses, which increased only 2% over last year. The strong revenue growth and control over expenses helped generate positive operating leverage and drove our efficiency ratio down to 30.6% from 34.2% last year. 
Our growth was supported by another quarter of strong deposit generation, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $50 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. The number has been trending above our original target of 60% to 70%, but we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by focusing on competitive rates and outstanding customer service as well as the build-out of our product suite. 
Our balance sheet remained strong with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and liquid assets totaling $16 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter-end. We were pleased to initiate our capital plan in the third quarter. This quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased shares totaling $238 million. We are also deploying capital through our strong balance sheet growth. 
Organic growth is the most significant driver of our performance and continues to be our biggest opportunity. This quarter, we renewed several key partnerships, including TJX Companies, a strong-performing program and great partnership. Cardholders can continue to access loyalty rewards, mobile account management and other exclusive benefits with cards which can be used at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores as well as through online. 
We also extended our 17-year partnership with hhgregg, a leading specialty retail of home appliances, televisions, consumer electronics and home furnishings. Through our partnership, cardholders will be able to continue to access special financing offers, in-store and online deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits when using their hhgregg cards in their 220 stores.
And we renewed our partnership with Nationwide Marketing Group, North America's largest buying and marketing organization. They work besides thousands of appliance, furniture, electronics and other dealers to help them grow their business. And we are happy to continue to provide consumer financing through this group. 
We are also pleased to have renewed an important endorsement by the American Dental Association. Endorsements are an integral part to helping us to extend the reach of our CareCredit platform. 
We also continue to sign new partnerships. We signed a long-term agreement with Nissan to introduce a new co-branded consumer credit program. The program will be offered through Nissan and Infiniti dealerships in the U.S. as well as online. It will provide Nissan and Infiniti credit cardholders with offers, rewards and exclusive benefits. 
In addition, we reached an agreement with At Home, a big-box specialty retailer of home decor products to introduce a new consumer financing program. At Home cardholders will be able to take advantage of promotional financing offers on qualifying purchases, exclusive discounts, loyalty rewards and other benefits, including mobile account servicing. 
We launched a new program with The Container Store. The Container Store private-label credit card offers financing options for the purchase of the retailers' more than 11,000 products, customized variety of services and organization solutions. 
We also launched a new program with the Google Store, which was announced in conjunction with Google's release of their new Pixel phone. We are partnered with Google to launch Google Store Financing, where we provide financing for their new hardware products, including the Pixel, Google Home, Daydream View VR headsets, Chromecast Ultra and Google Wifi. We had a very strong program launch and are excited about the prospects of this new partner and program. 
We remain focused on pursuing new, profitable opportunities to grow our business, although organic growth remains our biggest opportunity. And as such, we are working closely within our partners to continue to deliver leading-edge capabilities, value, increased penetration and to drive program growth.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans grew 12% over the third quarter of last year. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to partners and cardholders via attractive value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers. 
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continued to generate strong growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter of strong results. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 7% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad-based growth across Retail Card partner programs continued in the third quarter. 
As I noted earlier, we renewed TJX Companies, a key partnership for us. We also signed 2 new relationships with Nissan and At Home and launched a new Google Store program during the quarter. Our long-tenured relationships are an important part of our story. We are able to leverage the expertise we have developed over the decades of running this business into a platform that attracts new, important partners such as Nissan and Google. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 14% was driven by purchase volume growth of 14% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with home furnishings, automotive products and power leading the way.
We renewed several Payment Solutions relationships this quarter, including hhgregg and Nationwide Marketing Group. This quarter, we also extended our relationship with Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. to continue providing consumer financing for powersports products distributed by KMC through a network of approximately 1,100 independent retailers. Qualifying buyers will have access to special financing options for Kawasaki products from Synchrony. And we also launched the new program with The Container Store during the quarter. Repeat usage continues to be strong across Payment Solutions, representing 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. 
In addition to the renewal of a key endorsement with the American Dental Association, we also announced program renewals with 4 prominent dental organizations. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary area of focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive a reuse rate of 52% of purchase volume in the quarter. 
We are also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter, we introduced CareCredit Direct, a private and secure platform wherein patients can apply for financing privately at the health care provider practice, get a credit decision while they are there, and if approved, use their CareCredit card to pay for the services that day. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."

In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 12%. 
Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see positive trends in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 1% over last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $284 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve billed and receivables growth.  
Regarding asset quality metrics. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.82% compared to 5.31% last year. The asset quality metrics, which I'll cover in more detail later, reflect the gradual pace of normalization that we had highlighted last quarter. 
RSAs were up $34 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.3% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailer sharing in the incremental provision expense, which more than offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year improvement on net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. We continue to expect the RSA percentage on a full year basis to trend towards the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income was flat versus last year. While interchange was up $19 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $23 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $16 million or 2% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms and enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, which was a 362 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth in the business and maintaining discipline on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.8%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.27% for the quarter, up 30 basis points over last year. 
As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. We are also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth.
The yield on receivables increased 13 basis points to 21.58%, driven by a slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year. We typically see the revolve rate increase in the third quarter. We also benefited, to a degree, from the prime rate being higher compared to the prior year. These benefits more than offset the impact of a slight mix shift due to continued strong growth in lower-yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The platforms receivables have grown on average 15% compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 9% to 10% range over the past year. The cost of funding was up 3 basis points to 1.85% due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates.
Our deposit base increased by $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. The cost of our deposit base is lower than alternative forms of funding, such as wholesale funding. And we are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform and increasing the mix of funding coming from deposits. Deposits are 71% of our funding versus 63% last year. 
As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margin and expect the net interest margin to decline back into the 15.9% range due primarily to the seasonal buildup in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall, the credit environment remains favorable, and we continue to see significant growth opportunities at attractive risk-adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past 2 years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually over time. Our view on credit takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.89% compared to 1.73% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. The net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year, consistent with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.82% in the third quarter, which was largely in line with our expectations. The reserve build reflects the growth in the portfolio, the normalization of net charge-offs as well as lower recovery pricing, which we believe is partly attributable to the new proposed regulations around third-party collectors.
Part of the increase in credit costs is offset to our retailer share arrangements and is reflected in the decline of the RSAs as a percent of average receivables to 4.3% this quarter compared to 4.6% last year. This is also reflected in our full year guidance for the RSAs, which is now 4.2% to 4.3%. 
Looking to the fourth quarter. We typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and given the seasonal build in receivables, we expect to see a modest decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables. However, given the normalization trends, this decline is likely to be smaller than it has been in the past 2 years. 
We continue to expect net charge-offs to be around 4.5% for 2016, which is in line with our guidance for the year. We will provide a full year view on 2017 in conjunction with the outlook we'll provide in January. 
So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment and the risk-adjusted returns we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9. I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $859 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $43 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. 
Professional fees were up $12 million. This is primarily driven by growth in the business and certain third-party services. 
Marketing and business development costs were down $23 million. Higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were more than offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Lastly, given our strong growth in deposits, we were able to reduce some of the marketing costs associated with that platform. 
Information processing was up $10 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expense was down $26 million due to a reduction in costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE, as well as benefits derived from EMV in the form of lower fraud expense. 
The efficiency ratio was 30.6% for the quarter, 362 basis points lower than last year, as the business continued to generate significant positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Year-to-date, the efficiency ratio was 31%, 236 basis points lower than the same period in 2015. We expect the ratio to trend up in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses during the holiday season as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, given the strong start to the year, we do expect the ratio to be around 32% for the full year 2016, well below the guidance we provided in January.
Moving to Slide 10. I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as summarize our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. 
Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Our retention rate on our deposits has consistently been in the 88% to 89% range over the past couple of years. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In September, we successfully issued just over $750 million in 3-year fixed rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. 
Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets. And in August, we did issue a total of $700 million in senior unsecured debt, $500 million in 10-year fixed rate notes and $200 million of floating rate notes that mature in November 2017. So another fairly active quarter on issuance and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 120 basis points over the past year. 
Total liquidity increased to $24 billion and includes $16.4 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.1 billion undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach. And these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.
During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased $238 million of common stock out of the $952 million our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. 
Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

So if you look back over the past few years and you look at the receivable yield from the third to the fourth, it generally comes down in the fourth quarter, given you're building a lot of receivables obviously for holiday and the fact that they don't generate finance charge yields in the quarter. So it's really that seasonal trend that's driving the forecast in the fourth quarter. The other dynamics are relatively stable. I think if you look at margins more generally, we've been very pleased all year with the margins and the way that they have performed. If you remember back in January, we thought NIM was going to be around 15.5%. We kind of revised that guidance to 15.75%, something in that range after we saw the strong deposit growth. That obviously is continuing. And then we were able to improve the yield on the liquidity portfolio and also really optimize the amount of liquidity that we're holding. So all those things, all else being equal, should continue to flow through. And we think those will flow through to the fourth quarter. That's why we kind of guided to the -- we took the guidance up from 15.75% for the year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter, which should put you around -- somewhere around 15.9% for the year. So overall, we've -- I think we've performed very well on margins relative to what we thought back in January."

But in addition to that growth-driven building, we've had kind of the normalization effect also driving building. And so when we kind of go from the low of 5.12% allowance, gradually rising to kind of 5.8%, that credit normalization effect has also driven some building. And so kind of as we extend out the thinking of credit continuing to normalize over the next several quarters, for modeling purposes, is it kind of reasonable to expect that we kind of move into kind of like a 6% handle and gradually, as we get over the next several quarters into 2017, that, that number continues to rise? Or does that kind of flatten out at some point, where normalization is kind of achieved? Just trying to get a sense for how to think about that."

Let me just kind of break down the reserve build in the quarter. So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations.

And this quarter, we came in at 5.82%. So better-than-expected growth drove a big chunk of that reserve build in the quarter. I think just in the quarter and last 90 days, we added $2.4 billion in receivables. The recovery assumption that I mentioned earlier, that drove about $36 million of the build in the quarter, which is about 5 basis points of coverage. So if you adjust for that, the coverage would have been around 5.77%, so right in the middle of that range that we provided. And if you think about -- and maybe it's helpful just to break down the reserve build in the quarter a little bit. And this is not -- just to be clear, this is not how we calculate the reserve, but it gives you a way to think about the different pieces. So if you take that $2.4 billion of receivables growth in the quarter and you just take that at the old coverage rate of 5.7%, that gives you a build of about $135 million of the $221 million, right? And then you've got the coverage rate increase by 12 basis points, which is about $86 million. And if you break that down into 2 pieces, you've got the $36 million for the recovery pricing that I mentioned, and then you've got about $50 million or about 7 basis points as really for that normalization effect that we're seeing in the book over the next 12 months. So hopefully that gives you some pieces and a way to think about it going forward."

We're really looking at building out data lakes and a CRM capability that goes well beyond just data for growing but also from a productivity perspective and really enhancing the whole wing-to-wing experience from our customer, from the time they apply for credit all the way through to servicing. And we have a pretty big cross-functional team working on a number of initiatives around data analytics. I believe and I think as our partners continue to look at ways to create more loyalty with their customers, this is going to be an important element of what we can bring to our partners, combining that with the digital experience that our customers are starting to go through and really that area growing exponentially. So it's an important area. I think with mobile and data analytics together, I think these are 2 big growth levers for us as we look to really help our partners grow with their customers."

And so if you look at year-over-year, let me just talk about the quarter for a second, we had obviously very good growth. We had better margins, fairly big improvement year-over-year, much better efficiency ratio. And at least in terms of the margins and efficiency ratio, we think that carries through to the fourth quarter but for the seasonal elements that I mentioned earlier. And so all of those positive dynamics in the business pushed the RSA higher, right. And then those improvements in the quarter and our expectation going forward, there's going to be an offset there for the incremental provisions. And so I think you've got to carry some of the real positives through in the fourth quarter. And then obviously, those push the RSA higher, offset by what we're expecting on provision."

But look, I think, generally we've been very pleased with the growth that we've had all year. We've got receivables growth of 11%. We guided early in the year to 7% to 9%. So we're obviously tracking well ahead of the guidance we put out there in January. And I think when you look at the underlying growth drivers, they're all pretty strong. When you look at purchase volume per average active account was up, average balances per active account were up. We really measure -- as opposed to new accounts, what's really a more important measure for us is active accounts as with private label and our Dual Card, really trying to move that more towards the top of wallet card and get that usage and get that repeat purchases. And so if you look at the last 2 or 3 years and just compare that to the average active account growth in the last few quarters, we're up 7%. That growth has accelerated, which is a really positive dynamic for us. So I think there's really good evidence, good indicators that the consumers are spending more. They're seeing real value on our cards. The things we've done around the value propositions at Amazon and Walmart. We just announced another one at Guitar Center. Those are really paying off. And then if you look at some of the additional things that we track and talk to you about, online and mobile were up 26% in the quarter. That compares to about 15% for the industry. The reuse that we're getting in CareCredit was up year-over-year. It was 52% versus 50% a year ago. And we're bringing on new partners. We're bringing on new partners. I would say the majority of those are start-up programs though, so those aren't really influencing the growth that we've had so far year-to-date. And so to the second part of your question, most of the growth is really organic growth. It's driving that increased penetration. That's something that obviously we track by program. It's how we measure our teams. It's all we focus on. And that's the only way to really grow 11% in a retail environment that's growing 2% to 3%. And that's been pretty consistent. And our growth rates have been pretty consistent over the past 5 years. So I think we feel really good about, overall, the fundamentals that we're seeing on growth.

So I think the important part of digital and online is really our ability to continue to integrate with our partners. And so one of the things we're really working hard on now, obviously, we've done Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and those things. We have digital cards on our own. What we're seeing now is more and more retailers are creating their own apps. And we're really trying to work to be in that app so that it's a really seamless and frictionless process for the customer as they're shopping around on a mobile app of a particular retailer. So I think you're going to see us focusing even more on that as the retailers come to us and ask us to really engage at a much higher level. That's my point earlier.

We've got new programs at Chevron and BP, new value proposition at Walmart, the 3-2-1. So all of those are obviously influencing both the interchange and the loyalty lines that you see. And generally, more loyalty is a good thing. It means we're growing our receivables. We're generating finance charge revenue. The lines also run back to the RSA, so there's an offset there. And if you're looking at just the relationship between loyalty and interchange, the one thing I would just point out is this is very different than general purpose card. Given we have significant value propositions, like Amazon where we don't charge interchange, but we still offer a very attractive value proposition, we'd expect to see loyalty increase as a percentage of interchange going forward. That's -- we really don't look at those lines in isolation. We really measure them kind of in the context of the overall deal structure. So look, if we have the opportunity to launch a better value proposition that's going to drive more usage on the card, generate strong receivables growth, that's a good thing for us. It's a good thing for our partners. And it really comes down to that shared economic model."

And we use those savings that we generate there primarily to invest in long-term growth ideas, so things like mobile, data analytics, CRM. But even taking those investments into account, we'd still -- our goal would be to continue to generate operating leverage going forward."

And now it will be more reflective of growth and the normalization trends that we're seeing in the portfolio."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 mill",1389,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.
Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 million or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered strong growth in each of our sales platforms, driving double-digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. We also grew purchase volume 8% over the third quarter of last year. 
Looking specifically at our online and mobile purchase volume. Sales grew 26%. Our online and mobile sales growth has continued to far outpace U.S. growth trends, which have been around 15%. We remain focused on developing solutions to support this important sales channel. 
Looking at asset quality metrics. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% in the third quarter of last year. We continued our discipline on expenses, which increased only 2% over last year. The strong revenue growth and control over expenses helped generate positive operating leverage and drove our efficiency ratio down to 30.6% from 34.2% last year. 
Our growth was supported by another quarter of strong deposit generation, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $50 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. The number has been trending above our original target of 60% to 70%, but we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by focusing on competitive rates and outstanding customer service as well as the build-out of our product suite. 
Our balance sheet remained strong with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and liquid assets totaling $16 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter-end. We were pleased to initiate our capital plan in the third quarter. This quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased shares totaling $238 million. We are also deploying capital through our strong balance sheet growth. 
Organic growth is the most significant driver of our performance and continues to be our biggest opportunity. This quarter, we renewed several key partnerships, including TJX Companies, a strong-performing program and great partnership. Cardholders can continue to access loyalty rewards, mobile account management and other exclusive benefits with cards which can be used at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores as well as through online. 
We also extended our 17-year partnership with hhgregg, a leading specialty retail of home appliances, televisions, consumer electronics and home furnishings. Through our partnership, cardholders will be able to continue to access special financing offers, in-store and online deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits when using their hhgregg cards in their 220 stores.
And we renewed our partnership with Nationwide Marketing Group, North America's largest buying and marketing organization. They work besides thousands of appliance, furniture, electronics and other dealers to help them grow their business. And we are happy to continue to provide consumer financing through this group. 
We are also pleased to have renewed an important endorsement by the American Dental Association. Endorsements are an integral part to helping us to extend the reach of our CareCredit platform. 
We also continue to sign new partnerships. We signed a long-term agreement with Nissan to introduce a new co-branded consumer credit program. The program will be offered through Nissan and Infiniti dealerships in the U.S. as well as online. It will provide Nissan and Infiniti credit cardholders with offers, rewards and exclusive benefits. 
In addition, we reached an agreement with At Home, a big-box specialty retailer of home decor products to introduce a new consumer financing program. At Home cardholders will be able to take advantage of promotional financing offers on qualifying purchases, exclusive discounts, loyalty rewards and other benefits, including mobile account servicing. 
We launched a new program with The Container Store. The Container Store private-label credit card offers financing options for the purchase of the retailers' more than 11,000 products, customized variety of services and organization solutions. 
We also launched a new program with the Google Store, which was announced in conjunction with Google's release of their new Pixel phone. We are partnered with Google to launch Google Store Financing, where we provide financing for their new hardware products, including the Pixel, Google Home, Daydream View VR headsets, Chromecast Ultra and Google Wifi. We had a very strong program launch and are excited about the prospects of this new partner and program. 
We remain focused on pursuing new, profitable opportunities to grow our business, although organic growth remains our biggest opportunity. And as such, we are working closely within our partners to continue to deliver leading-edge capabilities, value, increased penetration and to drive program growth.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans grew 12% over the third quarter of last year. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to partners and cardholders via attractive value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers. 
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continued to generate strong growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter of strong results. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 7% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad-based growth across Retail Card partner programs continued in the third quarter. 
As I noted earlier, we renewed TJX Companies, a key partnership for us. We also signed 2 new relationships with Nissan and At Home and launched a new Google Store program during the quarter. Our long-tenured relationships are an important part of our story. We are able to leverage the expertise we have developed over the decades of running this business into a platform that attracts new, important partners such as Nissan and Google. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 14% was driven by purchase volume growth of 14% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with home furnishings, automotive products and power leading the way.
We renewed several Payment Solutions relationships this quarter, including hhgregg and Nationwide Marketing Group. This quarter, we also extended our relationship with Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. to continue providing consumer financing for powersports products distributed by KMC through a network of approximately 1,100 independent retailers. Qualifying buyers will have access to special financing options for Kawasaki products from Synchrony. And we also launched the new program with The Container Store during the quarter. Repeat usage continues to be strong across Payment Solutions, representing 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. 
In addition to the renewal of a key endorsement with the American Dental Association, we also announced program renewals with 4 prominent dental organizations. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary area of focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive a reuse rate of 52% of purchase volume in the quarter. 
We are also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter, we introduced CareCredit Direct, a private and secure platform wherein patients can apply for financing privately at the health care provider practice, get a credit decision while they are there, and if approved, use their CareCredit card to pay for the services that day. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."

In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 12%. 
Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see positive trends in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 1% over last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $284 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve billed and receivables growth.  
Regarding asset quality metrics. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.82% compared to 5.31% last year. The asset quality metrics, which I'll cover in more detail later, reflect the gradual pace of normalization that we had highlighted last quarter. 
RSAs were up $34 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.3% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailer sharing in the incremental provision expense, which more than offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year improvement on net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. We continue to expect the RSA percentage on a full year basis to trend towards the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income was flat versus last year. While interchange was up $19 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $23 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $16 million or 2% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms and enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, which was a 362 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth in the business and maintaining discipline on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.8%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.27% for the quarter, up 30 basis points over last year. 
As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. We are also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth.
The yield on receivables increased 13 basis points to 21.58%, driven by a slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year. We typically see the revolve rate increase in the third quarter. We also benefited, to a degree, from the prime rate being higher compared to the prior year. These benefits more than offset the impact of a slight mix shift due to continued strong growth in lower-yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The platforms receivables have grown on average 15% compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 9% to 10% range over the past year. The cost of funding was up 3 basis points to 1.85% due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates.
Our deposit base increased by $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. The cost of our deposit base is lower than alternative forms of funding, such as wholesale funding. And we are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform and increasing the mix of funding coming from deposits. Deposits are 71% of our funding versus 63% last year. 
As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margin and expect the net interest margin to decline back into the 15.9% range due primarily to the seasonal buildup in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall, the credit environment remains favorable, and we continue to see significant growth opportunities at attractive risk-adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past 2 years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually over time. Our view on credit takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.89% compared to 1.73% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. The net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year, consistent with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.82% in the third quarter, which was largely in line with our expectations. The reserve build reflects the growth in the portfolio, the normalization of net charge-offs as well as lower recovery pricing, which we believe is partly attributable to the new proposed regulations around third-party collectors.
Part of the increase in credit costs is offset to our retailer share arrangements and is reflected in the decline of the RSAs as a percent of average receivables to 4.3% this quarter compared to 4.6% last year. This is also reflected in our full year guidance for the RSAs, which is now 4.2% to 4.3%. 
Looking to the fourth quarter. We typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and given the seasonal build in receivables, we expect to see a modest decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables. However, given the normalization trends, this decline is likely to be smaller than it has been in the past 2 years. 
We continue to expect net charge-offs to be around 4.5% for 2016, which is in line with our guidance for the year. We will provide a full year view on 2017 in conjunction with the outlook we'll provide in January. 
So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment and the risk-adjusted returns we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9. I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $859 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $43 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. 
Professional fees were up $12 million. This is primarily driven by growth in the business and certain third-party services. 
Marketing and business development costs were down $23 million. Higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were more than offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Lastly, given our strong growth in deposits, we were able to reduce some of the marketing costs associated with that platform. 
Information processing was up $10 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expense was down $26 million due to a reduction in costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE, as well as benefits derived from EMV in the form of lower fraud expense. 
The efficiency ratio was 30.6% for the quarter, 362 basis points lower than last year, as the business continued to generate significant positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Year-to-date, the efficiency ratio was 31%, 236 basis points lower than the same period in 2015. We expect the ratio to trend up in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses during the holiday season as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, given the strong start to the year, we do expect the ratio to be around 32% for the full year 2016, well below the guidance we provided in January.
Moving to Slide 10. I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as summarize our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. 
Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Our retention rate on our deposits has consistently been in the 88% to 89% range over the past couple of years. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In September, we successfully issued just over $750 million in 3-year fixed rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. 
Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets. And in August, we did issue a total of $700 million in senior unsecured debt, $500 million in 10-year fixed rate notes and $200 million of floating rate notes that mature in November 2017. So another fairly active quarter on issuance and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 120 basis points over the past year. 
Total liquidity increased to $24 billion and includes $16.4 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.1 billion undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach. And these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.
During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased $238 million of common stock out of the $952 million our board authorized through the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. 
Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

So if you look back over the past few years and you look at the receivable yield from the third to the fourth, it generally comes down in the fourth quarter, given you're building a lot of receivables obviously for holiday and the fact that they don't generate finance charge yields in the quarter. So it's really that seasonal trend that's driving the forecast in the fourth quarter. The other dynamics are relatively stable. I think if you look at margins more generally, we've been very pleased all year with the margins and the way that they have performed. If you remember back in January, we thought NIM was going to be around 15.5%. We kind of revised that guidance to 15.75%, something in that range after we saw the strong deposit growth. That obviously is continuing. And then we were able to improve the yield on the liquidity portfolio and also really optimize the amount of liquidity that we're holding. So all those things, all else being equal, should continue to flow through. And we think those will flow through to the fourth quarter. That's why we kind of guided to the -- we took the guidance up from 15.75% for the year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter, which should put you around -- somewhere around 15.9% for the year. So overall, we've -- I think we've performed very well on margins relative to what we thought back in January."

But in addition to that growth-driven building, we've had kind of the normalization effect also driving building. And so when we kind of go from the low of 5.12% allowance, gradually rising to kind of 5.8%, that credit normalization effect has also driven some building. And so kind of as we extend out the thinking of credit continuing to normalize over the next several quarters, for modeling purposes, is it kind of reasonable to expect that we kind of move into kind of like a 6% handle and gradually, as we get over the next several quarters into 2017, that, that number continues to rise?

So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember, we gave you a range of 5.7% to 5.8%. And last quarter, we were right at 5.7%. And this quarter, we came in at 5.82%. So better-than-expected growth drove a big chunk of that reserve build in the quarter. I think just in the quarter and last 90 days, we added $2.4 billion in receivables. The recovery assumption that I mentioned earlier, that drove about $36 million of the build in the quarter, which is about 5 basis points of coverage. So if you adjust for that, the coverage would have been around 5.77%, so right in the middle of that range that we provided. And if you think about -- and maybe it's helpful just to break down the reserve build in the quarter a little bit. And this is not -- just to be clear, this is not how we calculate the reserve, but it gives you a way to think about the different pieces. So if you take that $2.4 billion of receivables growth in the quarter and you just take that at the old coverage rate of 5.7%, that gives you a build of about $135 million of the $221 million, right? And then you've got the coverage rate increase by 12 basis points, which is about $86 million. And if you break that down into 2 pieces, you've got the $36 million for the recovery pricing that I mentioned, and then you've got about $50 million or about 7 basis points as really for that normalization effect that we're seeing in the book over the next 12 months. So hopefully that gives you some pieces and a way to think about it going forward."

But look, I think, generally we've been very pleased with the growth that we've had all year. We've got receivables growth of 11%. We guided early in the year to 7% to 9%. So we're obviously tracking well ahead of the guidance we put out there in January. And I think when you look at the underlying growth drivers, they're all pretty strong. When you look at purchase volume per average active account was up, average balances per active account were up. We really measure -- as opposed to new accounts, what's really a more important measure for us is active accounts as with private label and our Dual Card, really trying to move that more towards the top of wallet card and get that usage and get that repeat purchases. And so if you look at the last 2 or 3 years and just compare that to the average active account growth in the last few quarters, we're up 7%. That growth has accelerated, which is a really positive dynamic for us. So I think there's really good evidence, good indicators that the consumers are spending more. They're seeing real value on our cards. The things we've done around the value propositions at Amazon and Walmart. We just announced another one at Guitar Center. Those are really paying off. And then if you look at some of the additional things that we track and talk to you about, online and mobile were up 26% in the quarter. That compares to about 15% for the industry. The reuse that we're getting in CareCredit was up year-over-year. It was 52% versus 50% a year ago. And we're bringing on new partners. We're bringing on new partners. I would say the majority of those are start-up programs though, so those aren't really influencing the growth that we've had so far year-to-date. And so to the second part of your question, most of the growth is really organic growth. It's driving that increased penetration. That's something that obviously we track by program. It's how we measure our teams. It's all we focus on. And that's the only way to really grow 11% in a retail environment that's growing 2% to 3%. And that's been pretty consistent. And our growth rates have been pretty consistent over the past 5 years. So I think we feel really good about, overall, the fundamentals that we're seeing on growth.

So it's something that we've put together what we call our digital mobile, online playbook for retailers. And this is something that we talk a lot about. So it's a big opportunity for us as we move forward and continue to work. What I would say is on the mobile world in general and online world in general, there's a lot higher engagement across all our partners right now in this particular area as they're all really coming to terms with the fact that they have to be best-in-class.

And obviously, we sell a portion of our charge-offs to third parties. And we believe that the pricing that we're seeing in the market right now is somewhat influenced by these new proposals. So the proposals include things like more documentation, more work for the third parties to substantiate the data at each stage of the collection process, reduce contact, other call restrictions, things like that, additional disclosures. And so a lot of these things aren't finalized at this point. But I think people are anticipating that at a minimum, it's going to be a little more difficult, a little more expensive based on these new proposals and they're building that into their pricing. And so as we started to see that right around the August time frame, we built that into the reserve model. And that's driving the, what I would call, relatively modest impact of 5 basis points on the coverage."

And each quarter, we see incremental growth on online and digital. As we stated, our online sales were up 26% over last year. And that continues to grow every single quarter. About 1/3 of our applications occur digitally. We have received about 12 million mobile applications since we've launched in 2012. And that's grown at about 80% year-over-year. So that's a big growth channel for us that, I think, you're going to continue to see expanding. And yes, we're seeing faster growth in the industry. So I think the important part of digital and online is really our ability to continue to integrate with our partners. And so one of the things we're really working hard on now, obviously, we've done Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and those things. We have digital cards on our own. What we're seeing now is more and more retailers are creating their own apps. And we're really trying to work to be in that app so that it's a really seamless and frictionless process for the customer as they're shopping around on a mobile app of a particular retailer. So I think you're going to see us focusing even more on that as the retailers come to us and ask us to really engage at a much higher level. That's my point earlier. I think there's been a little bit of, I think, a shift in terms of how retailers are even thinking about mobile and putting a lot more emphasis and effort there. And that's where we are very highly engaged right now across all 3 platforms really."

We've obviously introduced many new value propositions over the past year. We introduced the Sam's Club 5-3-1, Amazon Prime, 5%. We've got new programs at Chevron and BP, new value proposition at Walmart, the 3-2-1. So all of those are obviously influencing both the interchange and the loyalty lines that you see. And generally, more loyalty is a good thing. It means we're growing our receivables. We're generating finance charge revenue. The lines also run back to the RSA, so there's an offset there. And if you're looking at just the relationship between loyalty and interchange, the one thing I would just point out is this is very different than general purpose card. Given we have significant value propositions, like Amazon where we don't charge interchange, but we still offer a very attractive value proposition, we'd expect to see loyalty increase as a percentage of interchange going forward. That's -- we really don't look at those lines in isolation. We really measure them kind of in the context of the overall deal structure. So look, if we have the opportunity to launch a better value proposition that's going to drive more usage on the card, generate strong receivables growth, that's a good thing for us. It's a good thing for our partners. And it really comes down to that shared economic model."

We always start the year with a bunch of productivity initiatives, cutting out waste in the business, getting more efficient, moving more online, off the paper.

I'll begin on Slide 3.Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 mill",1389,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I'll begin on Slide 3.
Third quarter net earnings totaled $604 million or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered strong growth in each of our sales platforms, driving double-digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. We also grew purchase volume 8% over the third quarter of last year. 
Looking specifically at our online and mobile purchase volume. Sales grew 26%. Our online and mobile sales growth has continued to far outpace U.S. growth trends, which have been around 15%. We remain focused on developing solutions to support this important sales channel. 
Looking at asset quality metrics. 30-plus-day delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% in the third quarter of last year. We continued our discipline on expenses, which increased only 2% over last year. The strong revenue growth and control over expenses helped generate positive operating leverage and drove our efficiency ratio down to 30.6% from 34.2% last year. 
Our growth was supported by another quarter of strong deposit generation, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $50 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. The number has been trending above our original target of 60% to 70%, but we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by focusing on competitive rates and outstanding customer service as well as the build-out of our product suite. 
Our balance sheet remained strong with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and liquid assets totaling $16 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter-end. We were pleased to initiate our capital plan in the third quarter. This quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased shares totaling $238 million. We are also deploying capital through our strong balance sheet growth. 
Organic growth is the most significant driver of our performance and continues to be our biggest opportunity. This quarter, we renewed several key partnerships, including TJX Companies, a strong-performing program and great partnership. Cardholders can continue to access loyalty rewards, mobile account management and other exclusive benefits with cards which can be used at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores as well as through online. 
We also extended our 17-year partnership with hhgregg, a leading specialty retail of home appliances, televisions, consumer electronics and home furnishings. Through our partnership, cardholders will be able to continue to access special financing offers, in-store and online deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits when using their hhgregg cards in their 220 stores.
And we renewed our partnership with Nationwide Marketing Group, North America's largest buying and marketing organization. They work besides thousands of appliance, furniture, electronics and other dealers to help them grow their business. And we are happy to continue to provide consumer financing through this group. 
We are also pleased to have renewed an important endorsement by the American Dental Association. Endorsements are an integral part to helping us to extend the reach of our CareCredit platform. 
We also continue to sign new partnerships. We signed a long-term agreement with Nissan to introduce a new co-branded consumer credit program. The program will be offered through Nissan and Infiniti dealerships in the U.S. as well as online. It will provide Nissan and Infiniti credit cardholders with offers, rewards and exclusive benefits. 
In addition, we reached an agreement with At Home, a big-box specialty retailer of home decor products to introduce a new consumer financing program. At Home cardholders will be able to take advantage of promotional financing offers on qualifying purchases, exclusive discounts, loyalty rewards and other benefits, including mobile account servicing. 
We launched a new program with The Container Store. The Container Store private-label credit card offers financing options for the purchase of the retailers' more than 11,000 products, customized variety of services and organization solutions. 
We also launched a new program with the Google Store, which was announced in conjunction with Google's release of their new Pixel phone. We are partnered with Google to launch Google Store Financing, where we provide financing for their new hardware products, including the Pixel, Google Home, Daydream View VR headsets, Chromecast Ultra and Google Wifi. We had a very strong program launch and are excited about the prospects of this new partner and program. 
We remain focused on pursuing new, profitable opportunities to grow our business, although organic growth remains our biggest opportunity. And as such, we are working closely within our partners to continue to deliver leading-edge capabilities, value, increased penetration and to drive program growth.
Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans grew 12% over the third quarter of last year. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to partners and cardholders via attractive value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers. 
On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continued to generate strong growth across all 3 of our sales platforms in the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter of strong results. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 7% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad-based growth across Retail Card partner programs continued in the third quarter. 
As I noted earlier, we renewed TJX Companies, a key partnership for us. We also signed 2 new relationships with Nissan and At Home and launched a new Google Store program during the quarter. Our long-tenured relationships are an important part of our story. We are able to leverage the expertise we have developed over the decades of running this business into a platform that attracts new, important partners such as Nissan and Google. 
Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 14% was driven by purchase volume growth of 14% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with home furnishings, automotive products and power leading the way.
We renewed several Payment Solutions relationships this quarter, including hhgregg and Nationwide Marketing Group. This quarter, we also extended our relationship with Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. to continue providing consumer financing for powersports products distributed by KMC through a network of approximately 1,100 independent retailers. Qualifying buyers will have access to special financing options for Kawasaki products from Synchrony. And we also launched the new program with The Container Store during the quarter. Repeat usage continues to be strong across Payment Solutions, representing 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter. 
CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. 
In addition to the renewal of a key endorsement with the American Dental Association, we also announced program renewals with 4 prominent dental organizations. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary area of focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive a reuse rate of 52% of purchase volume in the quarter. 
We are also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter, we introduced CareCredit Direct, a private and secure platform wherein patients can apply for financing privately at the health care provider practice, get a credit decision while they are there, and if approved, use their CareCredit card to pay for the services that day. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to cardholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results."

I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase",2149,"Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loans up 12%. 
Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see positive trends in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 1% over last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $284 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve billed and receivables growth. 
Regarding asset quality metrics. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.82% compared to 5.31% last year. The asset quality metrics, which I'll cover in more detail later, reflect the gradual pace of normalization that we had highlighted last quarter. 
RSAs were up $34 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.3% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailer sharing in the incremental provision expense, which more than offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year improvement on net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio. We continue to expect the RSA percentage on a full year basis to trend towards the 4.2% to 4.3% range. 
Other income was flat versus last year. While interchange was up $19 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $23 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. 
Other expenses increased $16 million or 2% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms and enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, which was a 362 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth in the business and maintaining discipline on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.8%. 
I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.27% for the quarter, up 30 basis points over last year. 
As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. We are also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth.
The yield on receivables increased 13 basis points to 21.58%, driven by a slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year. We typically see the revolve rate increase in the third quarter. We also benefited, to a degree, from the prime rate being higher compared to the prior year. These benefits more than offset the impact of a slight mix shift due to continued strong growth in lower-yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The platforms receivables have grown on average 15% compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 9% to 10% range over the past year. The cost of funding was up 3 basis points to 1.85% due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates.
Our deposit base increased by $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. The cost of our deposit base is lower than alternative forms of funding, such as wholesale funding. And we are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform and increasing the mix of funding coming from deposits. Deposits are 71% of our funding versus 63% last year. 
As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margin and expect the net interest margin to decline back into the 15.9% range due primarily to the seasonal buildup in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall, the credit environment remains favorable, and we continue to see significant growth opportunities at attractive risk-adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past 2 years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually over time. Our view on credit takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. 
In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.89% compared to 1.73% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past 2 years. The net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year, consistent with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.82% in the third quarter, which was largely in line with our expectations. The reserve build reflects the growth in the portfolio, the normalization of net charge-offs as well as lower recovery pricing, which we believe is partly attributable to the new proposed regulations around third-party collectors.
Part of the increase in credit costs is offset to our retailer share arrangements and is reflected in the decline of the RSAs as a percent of average receivables to 4.3% this quarter compared to 4.6% last year. This is also reflected in our full year guidance for the RSAs, which is now 4.2% to 4.3%. 
Looking to the fourth quarter. We typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and given the seasonal build in receivables, we expect to see a modest decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables. However, given the normalization trends, this decline is likely to be smaller than it has been in the past 2 years. 
We continue to expect net charge-offs to be around 4.5% for 2016, which is in line with our guidance for the year. We will provide a full year view on 2017 in conjunction with the outlook we'll provide in January. 
So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment and the risk-adjusted returns we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. 
Moving to Slide 9. I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $859 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. 
Looking at the individual expense categories. Employee costs were up $43 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth of the business. This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. 
Professional fees were up $12 million. This is primarily driven by growth in the business and certain third-party services. 
Marketing and business development costs were down $23 million. Higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were more than offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Lastly, given our strong growth in deposits, we were able to reduce some of the marketing costs associated with that platform. 
Information processing was up $10 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expense was down $26 million due to a reduction in costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE as well as benefits derived from EMV in the form of lower fraud expense. 
The efficiency ratio was 30.6% for the quarter, 362 basis points lower than last year, as the business continued to generate significant positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Year-to-date, the efficiency ratio was 31%, 236 basis points lower than the same period in 2015. We expect the ratio to trend up in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume-related expenses during the holiday season as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, given the strong start to the year, we do expect the ratio to be around 32% for the full year 2016, well below the guidance we provided in January.
Moving to Slide 10. I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as summarize our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. 
Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Our retention rate on our deposits has consistently been in the 88% to 89% range over the past couple of years. 
Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 18% of our funding. In September, we successfully issued just over $750 million in 3-year fixed rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. 
Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets. And in August, we did issue a total of $700 million in senior unsecured debt, $500 million in 10-year fixed rate notes and $200 million of floating rate notes that mature in November 2017. So another fairly active quarter on issuance and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. 
Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 18.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 120 basis points over the past year. 
Total liquidity increased to $24 billion and includes $16.4 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.1 billion undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach. And these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.
During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased $238 million of common stock out of the $952 million our board authorized through the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. 
Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret."

So if you look back over the past few years and you look at the receivable yield from the third to the fourth, it generally comes down in the fourth quarter, given you're building a lot of receivables obviously for holiday and the fact that they don't generate finance charge yields in the quarter. So it's really that seasonal trend that's driving the forecast in the fourth quarter. The other dynamics are relatively stable. I think if you look at margins more generally, we've been very pleased all year with the margins and the way that they have performed. If you remember back in January, we thought NIM was going to be around 15.5%. We kind of revised that guidance to 15.75%, something in that range after we saw the strong deposit growth. That obviously is continuing. And then we were able to improve the yield on the liquidity portfolio and also really optimize the amount of liquidity that we're holding. So all those things, all else being equal, should continue to flow through. And we think those will flow through to the fourth quarter. That's why we kind of guided to the -- we took the guidance up from 15.75% for the year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter, which should put you around -- somewhere around 15.9% for the year. So overall, we've -- I think we've performed very well on margins relative to what we thought back in January."

We're getting more yields on the cash and securities that we're holding. But I would say anything there is going to -- anything additional is going to be pretty modest going forward."

So clearly, the very strong loan growth that we've been seeing has been driving reserve building. But in addition to that growth-driven building, we've had kind of the normalization effect also driving building. And so when we kind of go from the low of 5.12% allowance, gradually rising to kind of 5.8%, that credit normalization effect has also driven some building. And so kind of as we extend out the thinking of credit continuing to normalize over the next several quarters, for modeling purposes, is it kind of reasonable to expect that we kind of move into kind of like a 6% handle and gradually, as we get over the next several quarters into 2017, that, that number continues to rise? Or does that kind of flatten out at some point, where normalization is kind of achieved? Just trying to get a sense for how to think about that."

Let me just kind of break down the reserve build in the quarter. So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember, we gave you a range of 5.7% to 5.8%. And last quarter, we were right",314,"Yes. Sure, Bill. Let me just kind of break down the reserve build in the quarter. So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember, we gave you a range of 5.7% to 5.8%. And last quarter, we were right at 5.7%. And this quarter, we came in at 5.82%. So better-than-expected growth drove a big chunk of that reserve build in the quarter. I think just in the quarter and last 90 days, we added $2.4 billion in receivables. The recovery assumption that I mentioned earlier, that drove about $36 million of the build in the quarter, which is about 5 basis points of coverage. So if you adjust for that, the coverage would have been around 5.77%, so right in the middle of that range that we provided. And if you think about -- and maybe it's helpful just to break down the reserve build in the quarter a little bit. And this is not -- just to be clear, this is not how we calculate the reserve, but it gives you a way to think about the different pieces. So if you take that $2.4 billion of receivables growth in the quarter and you just take that at the old coverage rate of 5.7%, that gives you a build of about $135 million of the $221 million, right? And then you've got the coverage rate increase by 12 basis points, which is about $86 million. And if you break that down into 2 pieces, you've got the $36 million for the recovery pricing that I mentioned, and then you've got about $50 million or about 7 basis points as really for that normalization effect that we're seeing in the book over the next 12 months. So hopefully that gives you some pieces and a way to think about it going forward."

So we're obviously pleased to see that. I think it's still a little early to tell how significant the impact may be. Most of the more meaningful proposals, I think will be adopted after the 2017 cycle, so we'll have to see kind of what gets finalized. But clearly, the removal of the qualitative test for smaller financial institutions, I think that's helpful. The treatment of dividends, clearly, the RWA assumption, those are all helpful. But it's really hard to assess an impact until some of these things get finalized but I think directionally headed the right way for us."

The proposals will likely make it a little more difficult, a little more expensive to collect. And we believe that that's influencing the pricing in the market.

We're really looking at building out data lakes and a CRM capability that goes well beyond just data for growing but also from a productivity perspective and really enhancing the whole wing-to-wing experience from our customer, from the time they apply for credit all the way through to servicing. And we have a pretty big cross-functional team working on a number of initiatives around data analytics. I believe and I think as our partners continue to look at ways to create more loyalty with their customers, this is going to be an important element of what we can bring to our partners, combining that with the digital experience that our customers are starting to go through and really that area growing exponentially.

We had better margins, fairly big improvement year-over-year, much better efficiency ratio. And at least in terms of the margins and efficiency ratio, we think that carries through to the fourth quarter but for the seasonal elements that I mentioned earlier. And so all of those positive dynamics in the business pushed the RSA higher, right. And then those improvements in the quarter and our expectation going forward, there's going to be an offset there for the incremental provisions. And so I think you've got to carry some of the real positives through in the fourth quarter. And then obviously, those push the RSA higher, offset by what we're expecting on provision."

But look, I think, generally we've been very pleased with the growth that we've had all year. We've got receivables growth of 11%. We guided early in the year to 7% to 9%. So we're obviously tracking well ahead of the guidance we put out there in January. And I think when you look at the underlying growth drivers, they're all pretty strong. When you look at purchase volume per average active account was up, average balances per active account were up. We really measure -- as opposed to new accounts, what's really a more important measure for us is active accounts as with private label and our Dual Card, really trying to move that more towards the top of wallet card and get that usage and get that repeat purchases. And so if you look at the last 2 or 3 years and just compare that to the average active account growth in the last few quarters, we're up 7%. That growth has accelerated, which is a really positive dynamic for us. So I think there's really good evidence, good indicators that the consumers are spending more. They're seeing real value on our cards. The things we've done around the value propositions at Amazon and Walmart. We just announced another one at Guitar Center. Those are really paying off. And then if you look at some of the additional things that we track and talk to you about, online and mobile were up 26% in the quarter. That compares to about 15% for the industry. The reuse that we're getting in CareCredit was up year-over-year. It was 52% versus 50% a year ago. And we're bringing on new partners. We're bringing on new partners. I would say the majority of those are start-up programs though, so those aren't really influencing the growth that we've had so far year-to-date. And so to the second part of your question, most of the growth is really organic growth. It's driving that increased penetration. That's something that obviously we track by program. It's how we measure our teams. It's all we focus on. And that's the only way to really grow 11% in a retail environment that's growing 2% to 3%. And that's been pretty consistent. And our growth rates have been pretty consistent over the past 5 years. So I think we feel really good about, overall, the fundamentals that we're seeing on growth.

So the proposals include things like more documentation, more work for the third parties to substantiate the data at each stage of the collection process, reduce contact, other call restrictions, things like that, additional disclosures. And so a lot of these things aren't finalized at this point. But I think people are anticipating that at a minimum, it's going to be a little more difficult, a little more expensive based on these new proposals and they're building that into their pricing. And so as we started to see that right around the August time frame, we built that into the reserve model. And that's driving the, what I would call, relatively modest impact of 5 basis points on the coverage."

And along those lines, I know that the 2 largest debt buyers, both public, after a couple of years of commenting about elevated pricing and not much supply growth in the U.S., just the last couple of quarters, seem to have been indicating that pricing has been leveling off and so forth. Are you finding that the pricing as a percentage of principal balance that you're able to sell charge-offs for are declining? Or are they pretty much holding firm with historically more elevated pricing we saw earlier in the year?"

And then, Brian, I was wondering if you could elaborate, and you talked about this a bit, but the loyalty payments at $145 million, if you look at that in the absolute, it's the highest that we've seen. And then as a percentage of the purchase volume, it was also high. So anything that you could share on the trajectory of that would be helpful. So 1 on digital and 2 on loyalty."

And each quarter, we see incremental growth on online and digital. As we stated, our online sales were up 26% over last year. And that continues to grow every single quarter. About 1/3 of our applications occur digitally. We have received about 12 million mobile applications since we've launched in 2012. And that's grown at about 80% year-over-year. So that's a big growth channel for us that, I think, you're going to continue to see expanding. And yes, we're seeing faster growth in the industry. So I think the important part of digital and online is really our ability to continue to integrate with our partners. And so one of the things we're really working hard on now, obviously, we've done Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and those things. We have digital cards on our own. What we're seeing now is more and more retailers are creating their own apps. And we're really trying to work to be in that app so that it's a really seamless and frictionless process for the customer as they're shopping around on a mobile app of a particular retailer. So I think you're going to see us focusing even more on that as the retailers come to us and ask us to really engage at a much higher level. That's my point earlier. I think there's been a little bit of, I think, a shift in terms of how retailers are even thinking about mobile and putting a lot more emphasis and effort there. And that's where we are very highly engaged right now across all 3 platforms really."

We've obviously introduced many new value propositions over the past year. We introduced the Sam's Club 5-3-1, Amazon Prime, 5%. We've got new programs at Chevron and BP, new value proposition at Walmart, the 3-2-1. So all of those are obviously influencing both the interchange and the loyalty lines that you see. And generally, more loyalty is a good thing. It means we're growing our receivables. We're generating finance charge revenue. The lines also run back to the RSA, so there's an offset there. And if you're looking at just the relationship between loyalty and interchange, the one thing I would just point out is this is very different than general purpose card. Given we have significant value propositions, like Amazon where we don't charge interchange, but we still offer a very attractive value proposition, we'd expect to see loyalty increase as a percentage of interchange going forward. That's -- we really don't look at those lines in isolation. We really measure them kind of in the context of the overall deal structure. So look, if we have the opportunity to launch a better value proposition that's going to drive more usage on the card, generate strong receivables growth, that's a good thing for us. It's a good thing for our partners. And it really comes down to that shared economic model."

Now that the infrastructure costs are in the run rate, we would expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long run. We're always working to get more efficient across the business. We always start the year with a bunch of productivity initiatives, cutting out waste in the business, getting more efficient, moving more online, off the paper. And we use those savings that we generate there primarily to invest in long-term growth ideas, so things like mobile, data analytics, CRM. But even taking those investments into account, we'd still -- our goal would be to continue to generate operating leverage going forward."
