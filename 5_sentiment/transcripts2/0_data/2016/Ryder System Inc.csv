This morning, we'll recap our fourth quarter 2015 results, review the asset management area and discuss our forecast for 2016. Then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our fourth quarter results. 
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 for the fourth quarter 2015, up 4% from $1.60 in the prior year. Comparable results were below our forecast range of $1.72 to $1.82 but were impacted by $0.06 of unusual insurance-related items. Absent this, we were at the low end of our forecast range due to our used vehicle sales and rental results. 
Fourth quarter comparable results exclude $0.19 of restructuring and other costs and $0.05 of nonoperating pension costs. The restructuring cost during the quarter are related to workforce reductions impacting approximately 250 employees and, to a lesser extent, the pending divestiture of a small logistics operation in Canada. 
Comparable earnings from the prior year exclude $1.38 primarily for pension buyout cost. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 7% to a record $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 9%. 
Total revenue increased by 1% and was impacted by lower fuel cost, pass-through to customers and foreign exchange. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the fourth quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased to 53.3 million shares, up from 53 million shares last year. In December, our prior repurchase program expired, and we received the Board authorization for a new 2-year $2 million anti-dilutive share repurchase plan. The new plan allows management to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015 and another 500,000 shares from the recently expired plan that were not repurchased while activity was paused in early 2015. We expect to begin repurchases in midyear 2016, but we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate timing primarily based on our declining balance sheet leverage. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 32.1%, below the prior year's rate of 34.4%, reflecting a $2 million Canadian income tax settlement. 
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a full-year basis. Operating revenue grew at 6% to $5.6 billion, or increased by 8%, excluding FX. Comparable EPS from continuing operations were $6.13, up 10% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital widened to 140 basis points, up 30 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by higher leverage and higher earnings. 
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 7%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease and commercial rental. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, FMS operating revenue was up by 9%. 
Full service lease revenue increased 7% or 9%, excluding FX, due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new engine technology. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,800 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from planned reductions of U.K. trailers. This was above our initial forecast of 4,000 vehicles for the year and above our most recent forecast of 6,000 to 6,500 vehicles. Sequentially, from the third quarter, the lease fleet increased by 1,600 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers. 
Miles driven per vehicle per day on U.S. leased power units increased to 1% versus the prior year and continued to run at normal historical levels. Contract maintenance revenue increased 2%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by approximately 3,900 vehicles from the prior year and 4,100 units sequentially, reflecting a significant new customer that started up late in the fourth quarter and will primarily benefit revenue in 2016. 
Contract-related maintenance was up 14% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,200 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, an increase of 29% from the prior year. 
Commercial Rental revenue was up 6% for the quarter or 8%, excluding FX. Although U.S. demand increased, it was up by less than expected and reflected about 2 weeks later start to the holiday shipping season versus our forecast. We also saw less robust demand than anticipated in the tractor class. 
Global pricing was up 3% for the quarter, reflecting higher pricing in the U.S. and Canada and was in line with our expectation. The average rental fleet grew by 7% from the prior year. Rental utilization on power units was 77.6%, down 250 basis points from the prior year but still at a strong level. Utilization comparisons reflect the demand items I mentioned earlier as well as unusually high utilization levels in the prior year. Although Commercial Rental delivered solid growth, due to a higher level of uncertainty regarding the macro environment and somewhat less robust demand conditions with rental tractors, we made a decision to downsize our fleet during the quarter in order to more conservatively position our fleet for 2016. The ending rental fleet declined by 1,700 vehicles sequentially from the third quarter. Used vehicle results were negatively impacted primarily by lower pricing on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings increased due to higher full service lease results and solid rental performance. Better lease results reflect fleet growth and vehicle residual value benefits. These benefits were largely offset by lower used vehicle sales results and maintenance costs that downsized our rental fleet and reduced out-of-service vehicles. 
Earnings before tax in FMS increased 1%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 12.4%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. Of this 70 basis point decline, 60 basis points was due to used vehicle sales. 
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 8. Operating revenue growth was strong at 11% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing. Total revenue was up 5%, reflecting lower fuel cost pass-through to customers. DTS earnings increased 1% due to higher operating revenue and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a customer bankruptcy charge of $1.5 million. 
Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 5.9%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. The bankruptcy charge negatively impacted EBT margins by approximately 80 basis points. 
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, higher pricing and increased volumes. SCS operating revenue grew 7%, including the impact of foreign exchange. Total revenue was slightly down as higher operating revenue was offset by lower third-party purchase transportation costs and lower fuel costs pass-through to customers. SCS earnings before tax were up 5% due to operating revenue growth, improved operating performance and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a large medical claim of $2.2 million in the quarter. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 7.4% for the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. The large medical claim negatively impacted EBT percent by nearly 70 basis points. 
Page 10 shows the business segment view of the income statement I just discussed and is included here for your reference. 
Page 11 reflects our full year results by business segment. In the interest of time, I won't review these results in detail but will just highlight the bottom line results. Comparable earnings from continuing operations were $327 million, up 10% from last year. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital expenditures."

Full year gross capital expenditures were $2.7 billion, up $400 million from the prior year. This increase reflects full service lease fleet growth due to customer contracts signed as well as planned rental investments. 
We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $427 million. It's down $70 million from the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects planned lower volumes of vehicles sold. 
Full year net capital expenditures increased by $468 million to almost $2.3 billion. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $1.44 billion for 2015, up approximately $60 million. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings. 
We generated almost $2 billion of total cash during the year, consistent with the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by around $410 million to $2.7 billion. 
Free cash flow for 2015 was negative $728 million versus the prior year negative of $315 million, reflecting increased capital expenditures to support growth. Our growth capital spend for 2015 was $1.3 billion. 
Page 14 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of approximately $5.5 billion increased by almost $800 million from year-end 2014. Debt-to-equity at the end of 2015 increased to 278%, up from 260% in the prior year and just above the top end of our target range of $225 million to 275%. Leverage increased due to foreign exchange as well as vehicle investments to fund growth. Year-end equity was just under $2 billion, up $168 million for the year, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends. 
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Page 16 summarizes key results for our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 8,000 vehicles, up from 5,500 vehicles in the prior year and 1,900 vehicles above the third quarter. This is at the high end of our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles. The increased inventory reflects our decision during the fourth quarter to downsize the rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect to work this inventory down over the next few quarters and end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range. 
We sold 4,500 used vehicles during the quarter, down 2% from the prior year but up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. We sold 17,900 vehicles during the full year. During the quarter, used vehicle pricing declined by more than forecasted, particularly for tractors.  Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, proceeds from vehicles sold were down 5% for tractors and up 5% for trucks. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 9%, and truck pricing was down 2% versus the third quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter, overall, used prices were down 9% as compared to our expectations of down 7%, driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 11% from the second quarter peak. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term decreased versus last year by around 750 units or 12% during 2015 and is well below recessionary levels. This reflects a lower number of lease contract expirations during this year. 
Early termination of leased vehicles increased by 70 units this year and were generally in line with levels seen over the past 5 years. 
I'll turn now to Page 50 -- to Page 18 to cover our outlook for 2016. Page 18 and -- Pages 18 and 19 highlight some of the key assumptions we've made in the development of our 2016 earnings forecast. As you know, the economic and freight environments are highly uncertain at the moment, which makes forecasting challenging. Our approach to the forecast was to assume a significant negative impact in used vehicle sales and a weaker Commercial Rental environment as well as some headwinds in new lease sales. We think this is a prudent approach to our initial forecast for the year and will make any appropriate adjustment as conditions merit. 
When looking at our earnings forecast, it is especially important this year to consider the assumptions that are driving those numbers. 
In 26 -- our 2016 forecast anticipates slow to moderate growth for the overall economy. We're expecting our average interest rate to be consistent with 2015, as lower fixed rate refinancing rates offset higher variable rates. We're assuming foreign exchange rates remain stable at their current levels, which will result in a negative year-over-year impact to both revenue and earnings. 
In Fleet Management, we're expecting continued growth in full service lease based on our strong recent sales activity and secular trend that favor outsourcing, somewhat offset by softer freight conditions. For 2016, we're forecasting leased fleet growth of 3,500 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers, which would be our fifth consecutive year of organic fleet growth. This is similar to the initial forecast we provided in 2015 of 4,000 vehicles. 
We expect over 1/3 of our new lease sales to continue to come from customers new to outsourcing, driven by our initiatives to penetrate the nonoutsourced market. 
In rental, we's are assuming softer conditions with demand forecast down 5%. This is worse than what we experienced in 2012 but not as bad as what we saw in the last freight recession. Utilization is expected to be down, especially in the first half, while pricing is forecast to be up slightly, reflecting higher vehicle cost. 
As I mentioned earlier, we took actions during the fourth quarter to more conservatively position our fleet in light of a softer and uncertain market condition. For the full year, we expect the average rental fleet to be down 4% or 1,900 vehicles. Our forecast also assumes used vehicle pricing will decrease materially in 2016, particularly for tractors. Tractor pricing is forecast to be down by 20% from the peak in the second quarter of 2015, which would drive an overall price decline of 11% across all vehicle types. This is equivalent to the price declines we've seen in other recent downturns, including the 2008-2009 period. Volumes are expected to be higher as we work on the inventory of vehicles that were outserviced during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Significant increases in used vehicle pricing over the past 5 years will benefit depreciation rates in 2016 as these results are blended into our vehicle residual calculation. These benefits will partially offset lower expected gains on used vehicles sold. 
Overall, we expect higher FMS earnings due to growth in our contractual full service lease product line, partially offset by lower used vehicle sales results and, to a lesser extent, Commercial Rental. 
Turning to Page 19. DTS revenue is forecast to benefit from strong new sales activity, including continued conversion of leased customers to dedicated solutions. Dedicated earnings will benefit from revenue growth, lower insurance and lower overhead costs. 
In Supply Chain, we expect revenue growth driven by new sales, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts. We're expecting volumes to be stable, with earnings growth coming from new business. We've made reductions in discretionary and overhead costs in order to align our business with slower expected market conditions. We anticipate resuming anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second half of 2016 based on our current leverage projections. Despite this modest increase in share -- despite this, a modest increase in share count will negatively impact earnings since repurchases have been paused since early 2015. 
Finally, we're forecasting an EPS headwind due to a higher tax rate resulting from increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. 
Page 20 provides a summary of key financial statistics for our 2016 forecast based on these assumptions. We're expecting operating revenue to grow 5%, with revenue growth in all business segments. Comparable earnings per share is forecast in a range of $6.10 $6.30 in 2016 as compared to $6.13 last year. This reflects continued growth in our contractual product lines, offset by a softer expected environment for our transactional businesses. 
Our average diluted share count is forecast to increase to 53.6 million shares from 53.3 million last year. We project a comparable tax rate of 36.3, up from last year's rate of 35.3. The spread between our return on capital and cost of capital is forecast to narrow to 100 to 110 basis points, down by 30 to 40 basis points from last year, primarily reflecting lower results in used vehicle sales. Our 2016 return on equity forecast is 15.3%. 
The next page outlines our revenue expectations by business segment. In Fleet Management, operating revenue is expected to increase by 4% in 2016 or 6%, excluding foreign exchange. FMS growth is driven primarily by higher full service lease and contract maintenance revenue, partially offset by forecasted declines in Commercial Rental. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 2 percentage points. 
Full service lease revenue is forecast to grow by 6% or 8%, excluding FX. A higher leased fleet count due to new sales activity and higher leased fleet reflect increased vehicle cost -- vehicle investment costs are expected to be partially offset by weaker freight conditions. 
Longer term, we continue to expect that FMS can deliver operating revenue growth in the high single digits due to both market trends and our initiatives to drive increased rates of outsourcing. We're forecasting a 4% decrease in rental revenue, reflecting expectations for weaker demand conditions. We're expecting operating revenue growth of 9% in dedicated, reflecting strong new sales activity. Supply Chain operating revenue is expected to grow by 5% or 7%, excluding foreign exchange, also reflecting new sales. 
Page 22 provides a chart outlining the key changes in our comparable EPS forecast from 2015 to 2016. Weaker market conditions in used vehicle sales are expected to impact earnings by $0.62. Pricing on tractors is forecast to decline by 20% from peak, while truck pricing, which has been holding up better, is expected to decline by 5% from the peak. 
Sales volumes are expected to be higher due to the limited inventory available for sale in 2015. 
Commercial Rental is expected to decrease EPS by $0.28 based on lower forecast demand and utilization on a smaller average fleet, partially offset by higher residual values. Higher compensation expense is expected to impact earnings by $0.25 per share this year. This includes the cost of merit increases, higher medical cost and planned bonus. 
We continue to make strategic investments to drive future growth, particularly for IT and sales initiatives, but at a slower pace than in recent years. These initiatives will reduce EPS by $0.09. 
Higher earnings from other FMS product offerings, such as OnDemand and contract-related maintenance, will be partially offset by fuel, driven by a tightening wholesale versus retail spread. In total, these items are expected to contribute an additional $0.09 to EPS. 
Growth in dedicated revenue, combined with margin expansion, should add $0.20. In Supply Chain, we expect an additional $0.25, driven primarily by growth. Workforce restructuring and other cost savings actions were taken in order to benefit align our business with current market conditions. These actions are expected to generate an annual benefit of $0.38. The largest driver of 2015 EPS improvement is growth and increased returns in our contractual FMS product lines, totaling an additional $0.73 this year. This result -- this results from fleet growth and a depreciation benefit from higher residual values. The net impact of the operational items I've mentioned so far will result in an EPS of $6.54. In addition, however, we're forecasting a negative $0.24 impact from higher tax rate, increased share count and impacts from foreign exchange. This brings the high end of our comparable EPS forecast to $6.30, with the a of $6.10 to $6.30 forecast for the year. 
I'll turn the call over to Art now to cover capital spending and cash flow."

We're forecasting total gross capital spending of $2 billion, down almost $700 million from last year, with lower spending in lease and significantly lower spending in rental. 
Lease capital is forecast to decrease by $280 million due to lower forecast fleet growth and a softer freight environment. 
We are planning minimal capital spending for rental of $90 million, down $430 million from the prior year. The average rental fleet is forecasted to decline by 4%. The planned spending here is related to a change in the fleet mix to drive activity with better performing vehicle types. 
Proceeds from used vehicle sales are forecast to increase by about 8% to $460 million. Higher sales volumes are expected to be partially offset by lower pricing, particularly on tractors. As a result, net capital expenditures are forecast at $1.6 billion. This represents a $700 million decrease from 2015. 
Free cash flow is forecast at positive $100 million, reflecting lower gross spending in lease and only a minimal replacement capital spend in rental. With higher expected free cash flow, the business will delever, and we expect debt-to-equity to come down to 245% at year-end, just below the midpoint of our target range of 225% to 275%. This will provide us with additional balance sheet flexibility going forward and will be the key driver in restarting anti-dilutive share repurchases. 
We talked in recent years about the impact that higher growth capital spending has on the business. Page 24 highlights the amount of growth capital spending we've had by year, driven from both fleet growth and higher vehicle investment cost per unit and its impact on cash flow. 
For 2016, we expect to spend $680 million in growth capital for full service lease, with no growth capital in rental. That compares to growth capital spend of $1.3 billion in 2015. 
The box on the right-hand side of the page highlights 2016 growth capital spending in lease. An increase in the number of leased vehicles will require $275 million of capital, while higher per-unit cost will require an additional $405 million. Free cash flow is favorably impacted by reduced capital expenditures, demonstrating the countercyclical nature of our business model. 
As you can see in the bottom line of the page, growth capital spending in recent years has significantly benefited operating cash. Operating cash flow is projected to be over $1.6 billion this year, up over 60% since 2009.

And at some point, you have a fewer -- a less of a need for trucks. You're right, we are kind of assuming that's going to happen later in the year because what we're seeing right now is a relatively strong environment in terms of truck leasing. So we put that forecast out there based on, again, a very soft freight environment in 2016. But as the year goes on, we'll adjust based on what we're seeing. And I feel really good about the work that Dennis is doing with his team on converting more people to leasing. This will be the first time that we have -- is it 5 straight years of lease fleet growth? And we feel good about. We did not -- the  other thing I'd tell you is that we cut back in some areas.

I mean, I think it's part of -- I guess what I want to try to point out is unlike other years, I think we've had better visibility to the year. I think this year really -- it is a little murkier. There's a lot more uncertainty. You've heard a lot of talk about the industrial recession and a softer freight environment with some of the truckers. We've seen it manifest itself right now in our used truck pricing a bit and clearly a little bit more in rental. But that's why we felt it was prudent to really build this plane around that type of an environment. The truth is, it could turn off to be better. And if it does, I think we're well positioned to capitalize on that. Certainly, our lease sales will be better. Help our used truck pricing.

We thought it was the right thing to do to start the rental fleet down further, to be more conservative in our fleeting. So those vehicles were outserviced and put at the UTC for sale. So you did see it come up to the 8,000. We expect that to probably peak a little bit over 8,000 in the second quarter and then really start to work their way -- its way down. So by the end of the year, we expect that to be closer to the 6,000-unit range. So well within -- and again, that's primarily also because we don't have a lot of units coming up for renewal this year. Certainly, we're below the average. So that will kind of help us throughout the year. As it relates to the price saying all of used tractors or used trucks. New technology result, I will tell you that our experience, certainly through last year call prior to this downturn, was that the new, we're getting the proper pricing of a new technology. So we've got to see how that plays out. We've got a team that's out, I think, doing a great job of marketing the new technology. There's -- again, you do get to the point where the old technology becomes so old that a customer wanting a certain amount of uptime just has to go with something newer. And we're probably getting to that point. As you know, we hold our vehicles probably longer than most in the industry. So we feel good about the opportunity to sell the new technology and to continue to move those at appropriate pricing, especially as we get past this soft patch that we're seeing in the market."

With that, let's turn to an overvi",1281,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This morning, we'll recap our fourth quarter 2015 results, review the asset management area and discuss our forecast for 2016, then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our fourth quarter results. 
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 for the fourth quarter 2015, up 4% from $1.60 in the prior year. Comparable results were below our forecast range of $1.72 to $1.82 but were impacted by $0.06 of unusual insurance-related items. Absent this, we were at the low end of our forecast range due to our used vehicle sales and rental results. 
Fourth quarter comparable results exclude $0.19 of restructuring and other costs and $0.05 of nonoperating pension costs. The restructuring costs during the quarter are related to workforce reductions impacting approximately 250 employees and, to a lesser extent, the pending divestiture of a small logistics operation in Canada. 
Comparable earnings from the prior year exclude $1.38 primarily for pension buyout cost. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 7% to a record $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 9%.  Total revenue increased by 1% and was impacted by lower fuel cost passed through to customers and foreign exchange. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the fourth quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased to 53.3 million shares, up from 53 million shares last year. In December, our prior repurchase program expired, and we received board authorization for a new 2-year 2 million anti-dilutive share repurchase plan. The new plan allows management to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015 and another 500,000 shares from the recently expired plan that were not repurchased while activity was paused in early 2015. We expect to begin repurchases in midyear 2016, but we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate timing primarily based on our declining balance sheet leverage. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 32.1%, below the prior year's rate of 34.4%, reflecting a $2 million Canadian income tax settlement. 
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a full year basis. Operating revenue grew at 6% to $5.6 billion or increased by 8% excluding FX. Comparable EPS from continuing operations were $6.13, up 10% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital widened to 140 basis points, up 30 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by higher leverage and higher earnings. 
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 7%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease and commercial rental. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, FMS operating revenue was up by 9%. Full service lease revenue increased 7%, or 9% excluding FX, due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new engine technology. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,800 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from planned reductions of U.K. trailers. This was above our initial forecast of 4,000 vehicles for the year and above our most recent forecast of 6,000 to 6,500 vehicles. Sequentially, from the third quarter, the lease fleet increased by 1,600 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers. 
Miles driven per vehicle per day on U.S. lease power units increased 1% versus the prior year and continued to run at normal historical levels. Contract maintenance revenue increased 2%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by approximately 3,900 vehicles from the prior year and 4,100 units sequentially, reflecting a significant new customer that started up late in the fourth quarter and will primarily benefit revenue in 2016. Contract-related maintenance was up 14% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,200 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, an increase of 29% from the prior year. 
Commercial rental revenue was up 6% for the quarter or 8% excluding FX. Although U.S. demand increased, it was up by less than expected and reflected about 2 weeks later start to the holiday shipping season versus our forecast. We also saw less robust demand than anticipated in the tractor class. 
Global pricing was up 3% for the quarter, reflecting higher pricing in the U.S. and Canada and was in line with our expectation. The average rental fleet grew by 7% from the prior year. 
Rental utilization on power units was 77.6%, down 250 basis points from the prior year but still at a strong level. Utilization comparisons reflect the demand items I mentioned earlier as well as unusually high utilization levels in the prior year. Although commercial rental delivered solid growth, due to a high level of uncertainty regarding the macro environment and somewhat less robust demand conditions with rental tractors, we made a decision to downsize our fleet during the quarter in order to more conservatively position our fleet for 2016. The ending rental fleet declined by 1,700 vehicles sequentially from the third quarter. 
Used vehicle results were negatively impacted primarily by lower pricing on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings increased due to higher full service lease results and solid rental performance. Better lease results reflect fleet growth and vehicle residual value benefits. These benefits were largely offset by lower used vehicle sales results and maintenance costs to downsize our rental fleet and reduce out-of-service vehicles. 
Earnings before tax in FMS increased 1%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 12.4%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. Of this 70 basis point decline, 60 basis points was due to used vehicle sales. 
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 8. Operating revenue growth was strong at 11% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing. Total revenue was up 5%, reflecting lower fuel cost passed through to customers. DTS earnings increased 1% due to higher operating revenue and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a customer bankruptcy charge of $1.5 million. 
Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 5.9%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. The bankruptcy charge negatively impacted EBT margins by approximately 80 basis points. 
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, higher pricing and increased volumes. SCS operating revenue grew 7%, including the impact of foreign exchange. Total revenue was slightly down as higher operating revenue was offset by lower third-party purchase transportation cost and lower fuel cost passed through to customers. 
SCS earnings before tax were up 5% due to operating revenue growth, improved operating performance and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a large medical claim of $2.2 million in the quarter. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 7.4% for the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. The large medical claim negatively impacted EBT percent by nearly 70 basis points. 
Page 10 shows the business segment view of the income statement I just discussed and is included here for your reference. 
Page 11 reflects our full year results by business segment. In the interest of time, I won't review these results in detail but will just highlight the bottom line results. Comparable earnings from continuing operations were $327 million, up 10% from last year. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital expenditures."

Full year gross capital expenditures were $2.7 billion. It's up $400 million from the prior year. This increase reflects full service lease fleet growth due to customer contracts signed as well as planned rental investments. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $427 million. It's down $70 million from the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects planned lower volumes of vehicles sold. Full year net capital expenditures increased by $468 million to almost $2.3 billion. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $1.44 billion for 2015, up approximately $60 million. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings. We generated almost $2 billion of total cash during the year, consistent with the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by around $410 million to $2.7 billion. Free cash flow for 2015 was negative $728 million versus the prior year negative of $315 million, reflecting increased capital expenditures to support growth. Our growth capital spend for 2015 was $1.3 billion. 
Page 14 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of approximately $5.5 billion increased by almost $800 million from year-end 2014. Debt-to-equity at the end of 2015 increased to 278%, up from 260% in the prior year and just above the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%. Leverage increased due to foreign exchange as well as vehicle investments to fund growth. Year-end equity was just under $2 billion, up $168 million for the year primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends. 
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."
33956,321222059,924831,"Ryder System, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Ryder System, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Art. Page 16 summarizes key results for our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 8,000 vehicles, up from 5,500 vehicles in the prior year and 1,900 vehicles above the third quarter. This is at the high end of our target",1691,"Thanks, Art. Page 16 summarizes key results for our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 8,000 vehicles, up from 5,500 vehicles in the prior year and 1,900 vehicles above the third quarter. This is at the high end of our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles. The increased inventory reflects our decision during the fourth quarter to downsize the rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect to work this inventory down over the next few quarters and end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range. 
We sold 4,500 used vehicles during the quarter, down 2% from the prior year but up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. We sold 17,900 vehicles during the full year. During the quarter, used vehicle pricing declined by more than forecasted, particularly for tractors. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, proceeds from vehicles sold were down 5% for tractors and up 5% for trucks. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 9%, and truck pricing was down 2% versus the third quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter, overall, used prices were down 9% as compared to our expectations of down 7%, driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 11% from the second quarter peak. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term decreased versus last year by around 750 units or 12% during 2015 and is well below recessionary levels. This reflects a lower number of lease contract expirations this year. 
Early termination of leased vehicles increased by 70 units this year and were generally in line with levels seen over the past 5 years. 
I'll turn now to Page 18 to cover our outlook for 2016. Page 18 and -- Pages 18 and 19 highlight some of the key assumptions we've made in the development of our 2016 earnings forecast. As you know, the economic and freight environments are highly uncertain at the moment, which makes forecasting challenging. Our approach to the forecast was to assume a significant negative impact in used vehicle sales and a weaker commercial rental environment as well as some headwinds in new lease sales. We think this is a prudent approach to our initial forecast for the year, and we'll make any appropriate adjustment as conditions merit. 
When looking at our earnings forecast, it is especially important this year to consider the assumptions that are driving those numbers. Our 2016 forecast anticipates slow to moderate growth for the overall economy. We're expecting our average interest rate to be consistent with 2015 as lower fixed rate refinancing rates offset higher variable rates. We're assuming foreign exchange rates remain stable at their current levels, which will result in a negative year-over-year impact to both revenue and earnings. 
In Fleet Management, we're expecting continued growth in full service lease based on our strong recent sales activity and secular trends that favor outsourcing, somewhat offset by softer freight conditions. For 2016, we're forecasting lease fleet growth of 3,500 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers, which would be our fifth consecutive year of organic fleet growth. This is similar to the initial forecast we provided in 2015 of 4,000 vehicles. We expect over 1/3 of our new lease sales to continue to come from customers new to outsourcing, driven by our initiatives to penetrate the non-outsourced market. 
In rental, we're assuming softer conditions with demand forecast down 5%. This is worse than what we experienced in 2012 but not as bad as what we saw in the last freight recession. Utilization is expected to be down, especially in the first half, while pricing is forecast to be up slightly, reflecting higher vehicle cost. 
As I mentioned earlier, we took actions during the fourth quarter to more conservatively position our fleet in light of a softer and uncertain market condition. For the full year, we expect the average rental fleet to be down 4% or 1,900 vehicles. Our forecast also assumes used vehicle pricing will decrease materially in 2016, particularly for tractors. Tractor pricing is forecast to be down by 20% from the peak in the second quarter of 2015, which would drive an overall price decline of 11% across all vehicle types. This is equivalent to the price declines we've seen in other recent downturns, including the 2008-2009 period. Volumes are expected to be higher as we work down the inventory of vehicles that were outserviced during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Significant increases in used vehicle pricing over the past 5 years will benefit depreciation rates in 2016 as these results are blended into our vehicle residual calculation. These benefits will partially offset lower expected gains on used vehicles sold. 
Overall, we expect higher FMS earnings due to growth in our contractual full service lease product line, partially offset by lower used vehicle sales results and, to a lesser extent, commercial rental. 
Turning to Page 19. DTS revenue is forecast to benefit from strong new sales activity, including continued conversion of lease customers to dedicated solutions. Dedicated earnings will benefit from revenue growth, lower insurance and lower overhead costs. 
In Supply Chain, we expect revenue growth, driven by new sales, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts. We're expecting volumes to be stable, with earnings growth coming from new business. We've made reductions in discretionary and overhead costs in order to align our business with slower expected market conditions. We anticipate resuming anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second half of 2016 based on our current leverage projections. Despite this modest increase in share -- despite this, a modest increase in share count will negatively impact earnings since repurchases have been paused since early 2015. 
Finally, we're forecasting an EPS headwind due to a higher tax rate resulting from increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. 
Page 20 provides a summary of key financial statistics for our 2016 forecast based on these assumptions. We're expecting operating revenue to grow 5%, with revenue growth in all business segments. Comparable earnings per share is forecast in a range of $6.10 to $6.30 in 2016 as compared to $6.13 last year. This reflects continued growth in our contractual product lines, offset by a softer expected environment for our transactional businesses. Our average diluted share count is forecast to increase to 53.6 million shares from 53.3 million last year. We project a comparable tax rate of 36.3%, up from last year's rate of 35.3%. The spread between our return on capital and cost of capital is forecast to narrow to 100 to 110 basis points, down by 30 to 40 basis points from last year, primarily reflecting lower results in used vehicle sales. Our 2016 return on equity forecast is 15.3%. 
The next page outlines our revenue expectations by business segment. In Fleet Management, operating revenue is expected to increase by 4% in 2016 or 6% excluding foreign exchange. FMS growth is driven primarily by higher full service lease and contract maintenance revenue, partially offset by forecasted declines in commercial rental. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 2 percentage points. 
Full service lease revenue is forecast to grow by 6% or 8% excluding FX. A higher lease fleet count due to new sales activity and higher lease fleet reflect increased vehicle cost -- vehicle investment costs are expected to be partially offset by weaker freight conditions. 
Longer term, we continue to expect that FMS can deliver operating revenue growth in the high single digits due to both market trends and our initiatives to drive increased rates of outsourcing. We're forecasting a 4% decrease in rental revenue, reflecting expectations for weaker demand conditions. We're expecting operating revenue growth of 9% in Dedicated, reflecting strong new sales activity. Supply Chain operating revenue is expected to grow by 5% or 7% excluding foreign exchange, also reflecting new sales. 
Page 22 provides a chart outlining the key changes in our comparable EPS forecast from 2015 to 2016. Weaker market conditions in used vehicle sales are expected to impact earnings by $0.62. Pricing on tractors is forecast to decline by 20% from peak, while truck pricing, which has been holding up better, is expected to decline by 5% from the peak. Sales volumes are expected to be higher due to the limited inventory available for sale in 2015. Commercial rental is expected to decrease EPS by $0.28 based on lower forecast demand and utilization on a smaller average fleet, partially offset by higher residual values. 
Higher compensation expense is expected to impact earnings by $0.25 per share this year. This includes the cost of merit increases, higher medical cost and planned bonus. 
We continue to make strategic investments to drive future growth, particularly for IT and sales initiatives, but at a slower pace than in recent years. These initiatives will reduce EPS by $0.09. 
Higher earnings from other FMS product offerings such as on-demand and contract-related maintenance will be partially offset by fuel, driven by a tightening wholesale versus retail spread. In total, these items are expected to contribute an additional $0.09 to EPS. Growth in Dedicated revenue, combined with margin expansion, should add $0.20. In Supply Chain, we expect an additional $0.25, driven primarily by growth. 
Workforce restructuring and other cost savings actions were taken in order to better align our business with current market conditions. These actions are expected to generate an annual benefit of $0.38. The largest driver of 2015 EPS improvement is growth and increased returns in our contractual FMS product lines, totaling an additional $0.73 this year. This result -- this results from fleet growth and a depreciation benefit from higher residual values. The net impact of the operational items I've mentioned so far will result in an EPS of $6.54. In addition, however, we're forecasting a negative $0.24 impact from higher tax rate, increased share count and impacts from foreign exchange. This brings the high end of our comparable EPS forecast to $6.30, with the range of $6.10 to $6.30 forecast for the year. 
I'll turn the call over to Art now to cover capital spending and cash flow."

We're forecasting total gross capital spending of $2 billion, down almost $700 million from last year, with lower spending in lease and significantly lower spending in rental. 
Lease capital is forecast to decrease by $280 million due to lower forecast fleet growth and a softer freight environment.  
We are planning minimal capital spending for rental of $90 million, down $430 million from the prior year. The average rental fleet is forecasted to decline by 4%. The planned spending here is related to a change in the fleet mix to drive activity with better-performing vehicle types. 
Proceeds from used vehicle sales are forecast to increase by about 8% to $460 million. Higher sales volumes are expected to be partially offset by lower pricing, particularly on tractors. As a result, net capital expenditures are forecast at $1.6 billion. This represents a $700 million decrease from 2015. 
Free cash flow is forecast at positive $100 million, reflecting lower gross spending in lease and only a minimal replacement capital spend in rental. With higher expected free cash flow, the business will delever, and we expect debt-to-equity to come down to 245% at year-end, just below the midpoint of our target range of 225% to 275%. This will provide us with additional balance sheet flexibility going forward and will be the key driver in restarting anti-dilutive share repurchases. 
We've talked in recent years about the impact that higher growth capital spending has on the business. Page 24 highlights the amount of growth capital spending we've had by year, driven from both fleet growth and higher vehicle investment cost per unit and its impact on cash flow. 
For 2016, we expect to spend $680 million in growth capital for full service lease with no growth capital in rental. That compares to growth capital spend of $1.3 billion in 2015. 
The box on the right-hand side of the page highlights 2016 growth capital spending in lease. An increase in the number of lease vehicles will require $275 million of capital, while higher per-unit cost will require an additional $405 million. Free cash flow is favorably impacted by reduced capital expenditures, demonstrating the countercyclical nature of our business model. 
As you can see in the bottom line of the page, growth capital spending in recent years has significantly benefited operating cash. Operating cash flow is projected to be over $1.6 billion this year, up over 60% since 2009.

And we feel really good about our ability to do that. I think clearly, with -- if you look at just the overall -- your question about earnings leverage, the headwind from UVS is meaningful. Certainly, what we have forecasted in 2016 is a meaningful headwind, with a pretty significant decline in pricing. These cycles happen in used truck sales. We know. They typically last 4 to 6 quarters, and it's typically just when supply and demand get out of whack a little bit. But we see us getting through this like we've gone through them in the past.

And if you -- talk a little bit about why this environment matters for lease growth if a lot of these leases are long-term contractual in nature, they're trucks that people need, and it's not as cyclical as the rental division."

This would be the second largest growth rate that we've had in the company, so we're not really backing off growth. What we're looking at and saying, if you look at the overall freight environment, if freight environment slows down, it all trickles down. And at some point, you have a fewer -- a less of a need for trucks. You're right, we are kind of assuming that's going to happen later in the year because what we're seeing right now is a relatively strong environment in terms of truck leasing. So we've put that forecast out there based on, again, a very soft freight environment in 2016. But as the year goes on, we'll adjust based on what we're seeing. And I feel really good about the work that Dennis is doing with his team on converting more people to leasing. This will be the first time that we have -- is it 5 straight years of lease fleet growth? And we feel good. We did not -- the  other thing that I'd tell you is as we cut back in some areas, we did not cut back in the number of frontline sales people that we have, knocking on doors and finding new customers. So I'd say that's just to give you a little better color as to where -- how we came up with the 3,500. But clearly, we'll see how the year progresses. And if the freight environment comes in better, then you'll see us do better than that. I don't know, Dennis, if you want to add anything to that."

We've seen it manifest itself right now in our used truck pricing a bit and clearly, a little bit more in rental. But that's why we felt it was prudent to really build this plan around that type of an environment. The truth is it could turn out to be better, and if it does, I think we're well positioned to capitalize on that. Certainly, our lease sales will be better. It could help our used truck pricing.

So by the end of the year, we expect that to be closer to the 6,000-unit range, so well within -- and again, that's primarily also because we don't have a lot of units coming up for renewal this year. Certainly, we're below the average. So that will kind of help us throughout the year. As it relates to the pricing of used tractors or used trucks, new technology versus old, I would tell you that our experience, certainly, through last year, prior to this downturn, was that the new -- we were getting the appropriate pricing on the new technology. So we've got to see how that plays out. We've got a team that's out, I think, doing a great job of marketing the new technology.

I would tell you also, remember, we hold vehicles 7 years, so we're still selling vehicles from 2009 in this year. And we're still at a point where there's not a lot of new units -- there's not big production years coming into our used truck environment. So I think that will bode well through this downturn.

This morning, we'll recap our fourth quarter 2015 results, review the asset management area and discuss our forecast for 2016, then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our fourth quarter results. 
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 for the fourth quarter 2015, up 4% from $1.60 in the prior year. Comparable results were below our forecast range of $1.72 to $1.82 but were impacted by $0.06 of unusual insurance-related items. Absent this, we were at the low end of our forecast range due to our used vehicle sales and rental results. 
Fourth quarter comparable results exclude $0.19 of restructuring and other costs and $0.05 of nonoperating pension costs. The restructuring costs during the quarter are related to workforce reductions impacting approximately 250 employees and, to a lesser extent, the pending divestiture of a small logistics operation in Canada. 
Comparable earnings from the prior year exclude $1.38 primarily for pension buyout cost. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 7% to a record $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 9%.  Total revenue increased by 1% and was impacted by lower fuel cost passed through to customers and foreign exchange. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the fourth quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased to 53.3 million shares, up from 53 million shares last year. In December, our prior repurchase program expired, and we received board authorization for a new 2-year 2 million anti-dilutive share repurchase plan. The new plan allows management to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015 and another 500,000 shares from the recently expired plan that were not repurchased while activity was paused in early 2015. We expect to begin repurchases in midyear 2016, but we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate timing primarily based on our declining balance sheet leverage. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 32.1%, below the prior year's rate of 34.4%, reflecting a $2 million Canadian income tax settlement. 
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a full year basis. Operating revenue grew at 6% to $5.6 billion or increased by 8% excluding FX. Comparable EPS from continuing operations were $6.13, up 10% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital widened to 140 basis points, up 30 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by higher leverage and higher earnings. 
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 7%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease and commercial rental. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, FMS operating revenue was up by 9%. Full service lease revenue increased 7%, or 9% excluding FX, due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new engine technology. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,800 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from planned reductions of U.K. trailers. This was above our initial forecast of 4,000 vehicles for the year and above our most recent forecast of 6,000 to 6,500 vehicles. Sequentially, from the third quarter, the lease fleet increased by 1,600 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers. 
Miles driven per vehicle per day on U.S. lease power units increased 1% versus the prior year and continued to run at normal historical levels. Contract maintenance revenue increased 2%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by approximately 3,900 vehicles from the prior year and 4,100 units sequentially, reflecting a significant new customer that started up late in the fourth quarter and will primarily benefit revenue in 2016. Contract-related maintenance was up 14% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,200 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, an increase of 29% from the prior year. 
Commercial rental revenue was up 6% for the quarter or 8% excluding FX. Although U.S. demand increased, it was up by less than expected and reflected about 2 weeks later start to the holiday shipping season versus our forecast. We also saw less robust demand than anticipated in the tractor class. 
Global pricing was up 3% for the quarter, reflecting higher pricing in the U.S. and Canada and was in line with our expectation. The average rental fleet grew by 7% from the prior year. 
Rental utilization on power units was 77.6%, down 250 basis points from the prior year but still at a strong level. Utilization comparisons reflect the demand items I mentioned earlier as well as unusually high utilization levels in the prior year. Although commercial rental delivered solid growth, due to a high level of uncertainty regarding the macro environment and somewhat less robust demand conditions with rental tractors, we made a decision to downsize our fleet during the quarter in order to more conservatively position our fleet for 2016. The ending rental fleet declined by 1,700 vehicles sequentially from the third quarter. 
Used vehicle results were negatively impacted primarily by lower pricing on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings increased due to higher full service lease results and solid rental performance. Better lease results reflect fleet growth and vehicle residual value benefits. These benefits were largely offset by lower used vehicle sales results and maintenance costs to downsize our rental fleet and reduce out-of-service vehicles. 
Earnings before tax in FMS increased 1%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 12.4%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. Of this 70 basis point decline, 60 basis points was due to used vehicle sales. 
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 8. Operating revenue growth was strong at 11% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing. Total revenue was up 5%, reflecting lower fuel cost passed through to customers. DTS earnings increased 1% due to higher operating revenue and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a customer bankruptcy charge of $1.5 million. 
Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 5.9%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. The bankruptcy charge negatively impacted EBT margins by approximately 80 basis points. 
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, higher pricing and increased volumes. SCS operating revenue grew 7%, including the impact of foreign exchange. Total revenue was slightly down as higher operating revenue was offset by lower third-party purchase transportation cost and lower fuel cost passed through to customers. 
SCS earnings before tax were up 5% due to operating revenue growth, improved operating performance and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a large medical claim of $2.2 million in the quarter. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 7.4% for the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. The large medical claim negatively impacted EBT percent by nearly 70 basis points. 
Page 10 shows the business segment view of the income statement I just discussed and is included here for your reference. 
Page 11 reflects our full year results by business segment. In the interest of time, I won't review these results in detail but will just highlight the bottom line results. Comparable earnings from continuing operations were $327 million, up 10% from last year. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital expenditures."

Full year gross capital expenditures were $2.7 billion. It's up $400 million from the prior year. This increase reflects full service lease fleet growth due to customer contracts signed as well as planned rental investments. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $427 million. It's down $70 million from the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects planned lower volumes of vehicles sold. Full year net capital expenditures increased by $468 million to almost $2.3 billion. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $1.44 billion for 2015, up approximately $60 million. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings. We generated almost $2 billion of total cash during the year, consistent with the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by around $410 million to $2.7 billion. Free cash flow for 2015 was negative $728 million versus the prior year negative of $315 million, reflecting increased capital expenditures to support growth. Our growth capital spend for 2015 was $1.3 billion. 
Page 14 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of approximately $5.5 billion increased by almost $800 million from year-end 2014. Debt-to-equity at the end of 2015 increased to 278%, up from 260% in the prior year and just above the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%. Leverage increased due to foreign exchange as well as vehicle investments to fund growth. Year-end equity was just under $2 billion, up $168 million for the year primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends. 
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Page 16 summarizes key results for our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 8,000 vehicles, up from 5,500 vehicles in the prior year and 1,900 vehicles above the third quarter. This is at the high end of our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles. The increased inventory reflects our decision during the fourth quarter to downsize the rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect to work this inventory down over the next few quarters and end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range. 
We sold 4,500 used vehicles during the quarter, down 2% from the prior year but up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. We sold 17,900 vehicles during the full year. During the quarter, used vehicle pricing declined by more than forecasted, particularly for tractors. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, proceeds from vehicles sold were down 5% for tractors and up 5% for trucks. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 9%, and truck pricing was down 2% versus the third quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter, overall, used prices were down 9% as compared to our expectations of down 7%, driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 11% from the second quarter peak. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term decreased versus last year by around 750 units or 12% during 2015 and is well below recessionary levels. This reflects a lower number of lease contract expirations this year. 
Early termination of leased vehicles increased by 70 units this year and were generally in line with levels seen over the past 5 years. 
I'll turn now to Page 18 to cover our outlook for 2016. Page 18 and -- Pages 18 and 19 highlight some of the key assumptions we've made in the development of our 2016 earnings forecast. As you know, the economic and freight environments are highly uncertain at the moment, which makes forecasting challenging. Our approach to the forecast was to assume a significant negative impact in used vehicle sales and a weaker commercial rental environment as well as some headwinds in new lease sales. We think this is a prudent approach to our initial forecast for the year, and we'll make any appropriate adjustment as conditions merit. 
When looking at our earnings forecast, it is especially important this year to consider the assumptions that are driving those numbers. Our 2016 forecast anticipates slow to moderate growth for the overall economy. We're expecting our average interest rate to be consistent with 2015 as lower fixed rate refinancing rates offset higher variable rates. We're assuming foreign exchange rates remain stable at their current levels, which will result in a negative year-over-year impact to both revenue and earnings. 
In Fleet Management, we're expecting continued growth in full service lease based on our strong recent sales activity and secular trends that favor outsourcing, somewhat offset by softer freight conditions. For 2016, we're forecasting lease fleet growth of 3,500 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers, which would be our fifth consecutive year of organic fleet growth. This is similar to the initial forecast we provided in 2015 of 4,000 vehicles. We expect over 1/3 of our new lease sales to continue to come from customers new to outsourcing, driven by our initiatives to penetrate the non-outsourced market. 
In rental, we're assuming softer conditions with demand forecast down 5%. This is worse than what we experienced in 2012 but not as bad as what we saw in the last freight recession. Utilization is expected to be down, especially in the first half, while pricing is forecast to be up slightly, reflecting higher vehicle cost. 
As I mentioned earlier, we took actions during the fourth quarter to more conservatively position our fleet in light of a softer and uncertain market condition. For the full year, we expect the average rental fleet to be down 4% or 1,900 vehicles. Our forecast also assumes used vehicle pricing will decrease materially in 2016, particularly for tractors. Tractor pricing is forecast to be down by 20% from the peak in the second quarter of 2015, which would drive an overall price decline of 11% across all vehicle types. This is equivalent to the price declines we've seen in other recent downturns, including the 2008-2009 period. Volumes are expected to be higher as we work down the inventory of vehicles that were outserviced during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Significant increases in used vehicle pricing over the past 5 years will benefit depreciation rates in 2016 as these results are blended into our vehicle residual calculation. These benefits will partially offset lower expected gains on used vehicles sold. 
Overall, we expect higher FMS earnings due to growth in our contractual full service lease product line, partially offset by lower used vehicle sales results and, to a lesser extent, commercial rental. 
Turning to Page 19. DTS revenue is forecast to benefit from strong new sales activity, including continued conversion of lease customers to dedicated solutions. Dedicated earnings will benefit from revenue growth, lower insurance and lower overhead costs. 
In Supply Chain, we expect revenue growth driven by new sales, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts. We're expecting volumes to be stable, with earnings growth coming from new business. We've made reductions in discretionary and overhead costs in order to align our business with slower expected market conditions. We anticipate resuming anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second half of 2016 based on our current leverage projections. Despite this modest increase in share -- despite this, a modest increase in share count will negatively impact earnings since repurchases have been paused since early 2015. 
Finally, we're forecasting an EPS headwind due to a higher tax rate resulting from increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. 
Page 20 provides a summary of key financial statistics for our 2016 forecast based on these assumptions. We're expecting operating revenue to grow 5%, with revenue growth in all business segments. Comparable earnings per share is forecast in a range of $6.10 to $6.30 in 2016 as compared to $6.13 last year. This reflects continued growth in our contractual product lines, offset by a softer expected environment for our transactional businesses. Our average diluted share count is forecast to increase to 53.6 million shares from 53.3 million last year. We project a comparable tax rate of 36.3%, up from last year's rate of 35.3%. The spread between our return on capital and cost of capital is forecast to narrow to 100 to 110 basis points, down by 30 to 40 basis points from last year, primarily reflecting lower results in used vehicle sales. Our 2016 return on equity forecast is 15.3%. 
The next page outlines our revenue expectations by business segment. In Fleet Management, operating revenue is expected to increase by 4% in 2016 or 6% excluding foreign exchange. FMS growth is driven primarily by higher full service lease and contract maintenance revenue, partially offset by forecasted declines in commercial rental. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 2 percentage points. 
Full service lease revenue is forecast to grow by 6% or 8% excluding FX. A higher lease fleet count due to new sales activity and higher lease fleet reflect increased vehicle cost -- vehicle investment costs are expected to be partially offset by weaker freight conditions. 
Longer term, we continue to expect that FMS can deliver operating revenue growth in the high single digits due to both market trends and our initiatives to drive increased rates of outsourcing. We're forecasting a 4% decrease in rental revenue, reflecting expectations for weaker demand conditions. We're expecting operating revenue growth of 9% in Dedicated, reflecting strong new sales activity. Supply Chain operating revenue is expected to grow by 5% or 7% excluding foreign exchange, also reflecting new sales. 
Page 22 provides a chart outlining the key changes in our comparable EPS forecast from 2015 to 2016. Weaker market conditions in used vehicle sales are expected to impact earnings by $0.62. Pricing on tractors is forecast to decline by 20% from peak, while truck pricing, which has been holding up better, is expected to decline by 5% from the peak. Sales volumes are expected to be higher due to the limited inventory available for sale in 2015. Commercial rental is expected to decrease EPS by $0.28 based on lower forecast demand and utilization on a smaller average fleet, partially offset by higher residual values. 
Higher compensation expense is expected to impact earnings by $0.25 per share this year. This includes the cost of merit increases, higher medical cost and planned bonus. 
We continue to make strategic investments to drive future growth, particularly for IT and sales initiatives, but at a slower pace than in recent years. These initiatives will reduce EPS by $0.09. 
Higher earnings from other FMS product offerings such as on-demand and contract-related maintenance will be partially offset by fuel, driven by a tightening wholesale versus retail spread. In total, these items are expected to contribute an additional $0.09 to EPS. Growth in Dedicated revenue, combined with margin expansion, should add $0.20. In Supply Chain, we expect an additional $0.25, driven primarily by growth. 
Workforce restructuring and other cost savings actions were taken in order to better align our business with current market conditions. These actions are expected to generate an annual benefit of $0.38. The largest driver of 2015 EPS improvement is growth and increased returns in our contractual FMS product lines, totaling an additional $0.73 this year. This result -- this results from fleet growth and a depreciation benefit from higher residual values. The net impact of the operational items I've mentioned so far will result in an EPS of $6.54. In addition, however, we're forecasting a negative $0.24 impact from higher tax rate, increased share count and impacts from foreign exchange. This brings the high end of our comparable EPS forecast to $6.30, with the range of $6.10 to $6.30 forecast for the year. 
I'll turn the call over to Art now to cover capital spending and cash flow."

We're forecasting total gross capital spending of $2 billion, down almost $700 million from last year, with lower spending in lease and significantly lower spending in rental. 
Lease capital is forecast to decrease by $280 million due to lower forecast fleet growth and a softer freight environment.  
We are planning minimal capital spending for rental of $90 million, down $430 million from the prior year. The average rental fleet is forecasted to decline by 4%. The planned spending here is related to a change in the fleet mix to drive activity with better-performing vehicle types. 
Proceeds from used vehicle sales are forecast to increase by about 8% to $460 million. Higher sales volumes are expected to be partially offset by lower pricing, particularly on tractors. As a result, net capital expenditures are forecast at $1.6 billion. This represents a $700 million decrease from 2015. 
Free cash flow is forecast at positive $100 million, reflecting lower gross spending in lease and only a minimal replacement capital spend in rental. With higher expected free cash flow, the business will delever, and we expect debt-to-equity to come down to 245% at year-end, just below the midpoint of our target range of 225% to 275%. This will provide us with additional balance sheet flexibility going forward and will be the key driver in restarting anti-dilutive share repurchases. 
We've talked in recent years about the impact that higher growth capital spending has on the business. Page 24 highlights the amount of growth capital spending we've had by year, driven from both fleet growth and higher vehicle investment cost per unit and its impact on cash flow. 
For 2016, we expect to spend $680 million in growth capital for full service lease with no growth capital in rental. That compares to growth capital spend of $1.3 billion in 2015. 
The box on the right-hand side of the page highlights 2016 growth capital spending in lease. An increase in the number of lease vehicles will require $275 million of capital, while higher per-unit cost will require an additional $405 million. Free cash flow is favorably impacted by reduced capital expenditures, demonstrating the countercyclical nature of our business model. 
As you can see in the bottom line of the page, growth capital spending in recent years has significantly benefited operating cash. Operating cash flow is projected to be over $1.6 billion this year, up over 60% since 2009.

Certainly, what we have forecasted in 2016 is a meaningful headwind, with a pretty significant decline in pricing. These cycles happen in used truck sales. We know. They typically last 4 to 6 quarters, and it's typically just when supply and demand get out of whack a little bit. But we see us getting through this like we've gotten through them in the past.

We did not -- the  other thing that I'd tell you is as we cut back in some areas, we did not cut back in the number of frontline sales people that we have, knocking on doors and finding new customers. So I'd say that's just to give you a little better color as to where -- how we came up with the 3,500. But clearly, we'll see how the year progresses. And if the freight environment comes in better, then you'll see us do better than that. I don't know, Dennis, if you want to add anything to that."

We've seen it manifest itself right now in our used truck pricing a bit and clearly, a little bit more in rental.

The truth is it could turn out to be better, and if it does, I think we're well positioned to capitalize on that. Certainly, our lease sales will be better. It could help our used truck pricing.

Certainly, we're below the average. So that will kind of help us throughout the year. As it relates to the pricing of used tractors or used trucks, new technology versus old, I would tell you that our experience, certainly, through last year, prior to this downturn, was that the new -- we were getting the appropriate pricing on the new technology. So we've got to see how that plays out. We've got a team that's out, I think, doing a great job of marketing the new technology.

First, on the growth side, I think you hit it right. We had 11% growth on dry revenue. So first, make sure that you're working off the dry revenue number because the total revenue number is impacted by fuel changes, and the price of fuel is down 30%. But if you look at our base measure of operating revenue, we're up 11%, and that's been growing in the second half. We've had some pretty good traction with prior fleet conversions, and some of that is taking place in the second half of the year, so that's what impacted fourth quarter if you look at the sales and the product fleet conversions we saw during the quarter.

So I don't see that as being dramatically different that what we've seen in the past. I would tell you also, remember, we hold vehicles 7 years, so we're still selling vehicles from 2009 in this year. And we're still at a point where there's not a lot of new units -- there's not big production years coming into our used truck environment. So I think that will bode well through this downturn.

With that, let's turn to an overvi",1281,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This morning, we'll recap our fourth quarter 2015 results, review the asset management area and discuss our forecast for 2016, then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our fourth quarter results. 
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 for the fourth quarter 2015, up 4% from $1.60 in the prior year. Comparable results were below our forecast range of $1.72 to $1.82 but were impacted by $0.06 of unusual insurance-related items. Absent this, we were at the low end of our forecast range due to our used vehicle sales and rental results. 
Fourth quarter comparable results exclude $0.19 of restructuring and other costs and $0.05 of nonoperating pension costs. The restructuring costs during the quarter are related to workforce reductions impacting approximately 250 employees and, to a lesser extent, the pending divestiture of a small logistics operation in Canada. 
Comparable earnings from the prior year exclude $1.38 primarily for pension buyout cost. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 7% to a record $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 9%.  Total revenue increased by 1% and was impacted by lower fuel cost passed through to customers and foreign exchange. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the fourth quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased to 53.3 million shares, up from 53 million shares last year. In December, our prior repurchase program expired, and we received board authorization for a new 2-year 2 million anti-dilutive share repurchase plan. The new plan allows management to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015 and another 500,000 shares from the recently expired plan that were not repurchased while activity was paused in early 2015. We expect to begin repurchases in midyear 2016, but we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate timing primarily based on our declining balance sheet leverage. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 32.1%, below the prior year's rate of 34.4%, reflecting a $2 million Canadian income tax settlement. 
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a full year basis. Operating revenue grew at 6% to $5.6 billion or increased by 8% excluding FX. Comparable EPS from continuing operations were $6.13, up 10% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital widened to 140 basis points, up 30 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by higher leverage and higher earnings. 
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 7%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease and commercial rental. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, FMS operating revenue was up by 9%. Full service lease revenue increased 7%, or 9% excluding FX, due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new engine technology. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,800 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from planned reductions of U.K. trailers. This was above our initial forecast of 4,000 vehicles for the year and above our most recent forecast of 6,000 to 6,500 vehicles. Sequentially, from the third quarter, the lease fleet increased by 1,600 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers. 
Miles driven per vehicle per day on U.S. lease power units increased 1% versus the prior year and continued to run at normal historical levels. Contract maintenance revenue increased 2%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by approximately 3,900 vehicles from the prior year and 4,100 units sequentially, reflecting a significant new customer that started up late in the fourth quarter and will primarily benefit revenue in 2016. Contract-related maintenance was up 14% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,200 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, an increase of 29% from the prior year. 
Commercial rental revenue was up 6% for the quarter or 8% excluding FX. Although U.S. demand increased, it was up by less than expected and reflected about 2 weeks later start to the holiday shipping season versus our forecast. We also saw less robust demand than anticipated in the tractor class. 
Global pricing was up 3% for the quarter, reflecting higher pricing in the U.S. and Canada and was in line with our expectation. The average rental fleet grew by 7% from the prior year. 
Rental utilization on power units was 77.6%, down 250 basis points from the prior year but still at a strong level. Utilization comparisons reflect the demand items I mentioned earlier as well as unusually high utilization levels in the prior year. Although commercial rental delivered solid growth, due to a high level of uncertainty regarding the macro environment and somewhat less robust demand conditions with rental tractors, we made a decision to downsize our fleet during the quarter in order to more conservatively position our fleet for 2016. The ending rental fleet declined by 1,700 vehicles sequentially from the third quarter. 
Used vehicle results were negatively impacted primarily by lower pricing on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings increased due to higher full service lease results and solid rental performance. Better lease results reflect fleet growth and vehicle residual value benefits. These benefits were largely offset by lower used vehicle sales results and maintenance costs to downsize our rental fleet and reduce out-of-service vehicles. 
Earnings before tax and FMS increased 1%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 12.4%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. Of this 70 basis point decline, 60 basis points was due to used vehicle sales. 
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 8. Operating revenue growth was strong at 11% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing. Total revenue was up 5%, reflecting lower fuel cost passed through to customers. DTS earnings increased 1% due to higher operating revenue and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a customer bankruptcy charge of $1.5 million. 
Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 5.9%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. The bankruptcy charge negatively impacted EBT margins by approximately 80 basis points. 
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, higher pricing and increased volumes. SCS operating revenue grew 7%, including the impact of foreign exchange. Total revenue was slightly down as higher operating revenue was offset by lower third-party purchase transportation cost and lower fuel cost passed through to customers. 
SCS earnings before tax were up 5% due to operating revenue growth, improved operating performance and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a large medical claim of $2.2 million in the quarter. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 7.4% for the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. The large medical claim negatively impacted EBT percent by nearly 70 basis points. 
Page 10 shows the business segment view of the income statement I just discussed and is included here for your reference. 
Page 11 reflects our full year results by business segment. In the interest of time, I won't review these results in detail but will just highlight the bottom line results. Comparable earnings from continuing operations were $327 million, up 10% from last year. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital expenditures."

Full year gross capital expenditures were $2.7 billion. It's up $400 million from the prior year. This increase reflects full service lease fleet growth due to customer contracts signed as well as planned rental investments. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $427 million. It's down $70 million from the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects planned lower volumes of vehicles sold. Full year net capital expenditures increased by $468 million to almost $2.3 billion. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $1.44 billion for 2015, up approximately $60 million. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings. We generated almost $2 billion of total cash during the year, consistent with the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by around $410 million to $2.7 billion. Free cash flow for 2015 was negative $728 million versus the prior year negative of $315 million, reflecting increased capital expenditures to support growth. Our growth capital spend for 2015 was $1.3 billion. 
Page 14 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of approximately $5.5 billion increased by almost $800 million from year-end 2014. Debt-to-equity at the end of 2015 increased to 278%, up from 260% in the prior year and just above the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%. Leverage increased due to foreign exchange as well as vehicle investments to fund growth. Year-end equity was just under $2 billion, up $168 million for the year primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends. 
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Page 16 summarizes key results for our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 8,000 vehicles, up from 5,500 vehicles in the prior year and 1,900 vehicles above the third quarter. This is at the high end of our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles. The increased inventory reflects our decision during the fourth quarter to downsize the rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect to work this inventory down over the next few quarters and end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range. 
We sold 4,500 used vehicles during the quarter, down 2% from the prior year but up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. We sold 17,900 vehicles during the full year. During the quarter, used vehicle pricing declined by more than forecasted, particularly for tractors. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, proceeds from vehicles sold were down 5% for tractors and up 5% for trucks. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 9%, and truck pricing was down 2% versus the third quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter, overall, used prices were down 9% as compared to our expectations of down 7%, driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 11% from the second quarter peak. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term decreased versus last year by around 750 units or 12% during 2015 and is well below recessionary levels. This reflects a lower number of lease contract expirations this year. 
Early termination of leased vehicles increased by 70 units this year and were generally in line with levels seen over the past 5 years. 
I'll turn now to Page 18 to cover our outlook for 2016. Page 18 and -- Pages 18 and 19 highlight some of the key assumptions we've made in the development of our 2016 earnings forecast. As you know, the economic and freight environments are highly uncertain at the moment, which makes forecasting challenging. Our approach to the forecast was to assume a significant negative impact in used vehicle sales and a weaker commercial rental environment as well as some headwinds in new lease sales. We think this is a prudent approach to our initial forecast for the year, and we'll make any appropriate adjustment as conditions merit. 
When looking at our earnings forecast, it is especially important this year to consider the assumptions that are driving those numbers. Our 2016 forecast anticipates slow to moderate growth for the overall economy. We're expecting our average interest rate to be consistent with 2015 as lower fixed rate refinancing rates offset higher variable rates. We're assuming foreign exchange rates remain stable at their current levels, which will result in a negative year-over-year impact to both revenue and earnings. 
In Fleet Management, we're expecting continued growth in full service lease based on our strong recent sales activity and secular trends that favor outsourcing, somewhat offset by softer freight conditions. For 2016, we're forecasting lease fleet growth of 3,500 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers, which would be our fifth consecutive year of organic fleet growth. This is similar to the initial forecast we provided in 2015 of 4,000 vehicles. We expect over 1/3 of our new lease sales to continue to come from customers new to outsourcing, driven by our initiatives to penetrate the non-outsourced market. 
In rental, we're assuming softer conditions with demand forecast down 5%. This is worse than what we experienced in 2012 but not as bad as what we saw in the last freight recession. Utilization is expected to be down, especially in the first half, while pricing is forecast to be up slightly, reflecting higher vehicle cost. 
As I mentioned earlier, we took actions during the fourth quarter to more conservatively position our fleet in light of a softer and uncertain market condition. For the full year, we expect the average rental fleet to be down 4% or 1,900 vehicles. Our forecast also assumes used vehicle pricing will decrease materially in 2016, particularly for tractors. Tractor pricing is forecast to be down by 20% from the peak in the second quarter of 2015, which would drive an overall price decline of 11% across all vehicle types. This is equivalent to the price declines we've seen in other recent downturns, including the 2008-2009 period. Volumes are expected to be higher as we work down the inventory of vehicles that were outserviced during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Significant increases in used vehicle pricing over the past 5 years will benefit depreciation rates in 2016 as these results are blended into our vehicle residual calculation. These benefits will partially offset lower expected gains on used vehicles sold. 
Overall, we expect higher FMS earnings due to growth in our contractual full service lease product line, partially offset by lower used vehicle sales results and, to a lesser extent, commercial rental. 
Turning to Page 19. DTS revenue is forecast to benefit from strong new sales activity, including continued conversion of lease customers to dedicated solutions. Dedicated earnings will benefit from revenue growth, lower insurance and lower overhead costs. 
In Supply Chain, we expect revenue growth driven by new sales, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts. We're expecting volumes to be stable, with earnings growth coming from new business. We've made reductions in discretionary and overhead costs in order to align our business with slower expected market conditions. We anticipate resuming anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second half of 2016 based on our current leverage projections. Despite this modest increase in share -- despite this, a modest increase in share count will negatively impact earnings since repurchases have been paused since early 2015. 
Finally, we're forecasting an EPS headwind due to a higher tax rate resulting from increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. 
Page 20 provides a summary of key financial statistics for our 2016 forecast based on these assumptions. We're expecting operating revenue to grow 5%, with revenue growth in all business segments. Comparable earnings per share is forecast in a range of $6.10 to $6.30 in 2016 as compared to $6.13 last year. This reflects continued growth in our contractual product lines, offset by a softer expected environment for our transactional businesses. Our average diluted share count is forecast to increase to 53.6 million shares from 53.3 million last year. We project a comparable tax rate of 36.3%, up from last year's rate of 35.3%. The spread between our return on capital and cost of capital is forecast to narrow to 100 to 110 basis points, down by 30 to 40 basis points from last year, primarily reflecting lower results in used vehicle sales. Our 2016 return on equity forecast is 15.3%. 
The next page outlines our revenue expectations by business segment. In Fleet Management, operating revenue is expected to increase by 4% in 2016 or 6% excluding foreign exchange. FMS growth is driven primarily by higher full service lease and contract maintenance revenue, partially offset by forecasted declines in commercial rental. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 2 percentage points. 
Full service lease revenue is forecast to grow by 6% or 8% excluding FX. A higher lease fleet count due to new sales activity and higher lease fleet reflect increased vehicle cost -- vehicle investment costs are expected to be partially offset by weaker freight conditions. 
Longer term, we continue to expect that FMS can deliver operating revenue growth in the high single digits due to both market trends and our initiatives to drive increased rates of outsourcing. We're forecasting a 4% decrease in rental revenue, reflecting expectations for weaker demand conditions. We're expecting operating revenue growth of 9% in Dedicated, reflecting strong new sales activity. Supply Chain operating revenue is expected to grow by 5% or 7% excluding foreign exchange, also reflecting new sales. 
Page 22 provides a chart outlining the key changes in our comparable EPS forecast from 2015 to 2016. Weaker market conditions in used vehicle sales are expected to impact earnings by $0.62. Pricing on tractors is forecast to decline by 20% from peak, while truck pricing, which has been holding up better, is expected to decline by 5% from the peak. Sales volumes are expected to be higher due to the limited inventory available for sale in 2015. Commercial rental is expected to decrease EPS by $0.28 based on lower forecast demand and utilization on a smaller average fleet, partially offset by higher residual values. 
Higher compensation expense is expected to impact earnings by $0.25 per share this year. This includes the cost of merit increases, higher medical cost and planned bonus. 
We continue to make strategic investments to drive future growth, particularly for IT and sales initiatives, but at a slower pace than in recent years. These initiatives will reduce EPS by $0.09. 
Higher earnings from other FMS product offerings such as on-demand and contract-related maintenance will be partially offset by fuel, driven by a tightening wholesale versus retail spread. In total, these items are expected to contribute an additional $0.09 to EPS. Growth in Dedicated revenue, combined with margin expansion, should add $0.20. In Supply Chain, we expect an additional $0.25, driven primarily by growth. 
Workforce restructuring and other cost savings actions were taken in order to better align our business with current market conditions. These actions are expected to generate an annual benefit of $0.38. The largest driver of 2015 EPS improvement is growth and increased returns in our contractual FMS product lines, totaling an additional $0.73 this year. This result -- this results from fleet growth and a depreciation benefit from higher residual values. The net impact of the operational items I've mentioned so far will result in an EPS of $6.54. In addition, however, we're forecasting a negative $0.24 impact from higher tax rate, increased share count and impacts from foreign exchange. This brings the high end of our comparable EPS forecast to $6.30, with the range of $6.10 to $6.30 forecast for the year. 
I'll turn the call over to Art now to cover capital spending and cash flow."

We're forecasting total gross capital spending of $2 billion, down almost $700 million from last year, with lower spending in lease and significantly lower spending in rental. 
Lease capital is forecast to decrease by $280 million due to lower forecast fleet growth in a softer freight environment.  
We are planning minimal capital spending for rental of $90 million, down $430 million from the prior year. The average rental fleet is forecasted to decline by 4%. The planned spending here is related to a change in the fleet mix to drive activity with better-performing vehicle types. 
Proceeds from used vehicle sales are forecast to increase by about 8% to $460 million. Higher sales volumes are expected to be partially offset by lower pricing, particularly on tractors. As a result, net capital expenditures are forecast at $1.6 billion. This represents a $700 million decrease from 2015. 
Free cash flow is forecast at positive $100 million, reflecting lower gross spending in lease and only a minimal replacement capital spend in rental. With higher expected free cash flow, the business will delever, and we expect debt-to-equity to come down to 245% at year-end, just below the midpoint of our target range of 225% to 275%. This will provide us with additional balance sheet flexibility going forward and will be the key driver in restarting anti-dilutive share repurchases. 
We've talked in recent years about the impact that higher growth capital spending has on the business. Page 24 highlights the amount of growth capital spending we've had by year, driven from both fleet growth and higher vehicle investment cost per unit and its impact on cash flow. 
For 2016, we expect to spend $680 million in growth capital for full service lease with no growth capital in rental. That compares to growth capital spend of $1.3 billion in 2015. 
The box on the right-hand side of the page highlights 2016 growth capital spending in lease. An increase in the number of lease vehicles will require $275 million of capital, while higher per-unit cost will require an additional $405 million. Free cash flow is favorably impacted by reduced capital expenditures, demonstrating the countercyclical nature of our business model. 
As you can see in the bottom line of the page, growth capital spending in recent years has significantly benefited operating cash. Operating cash flow is projected to be over $1.6 billion this year, up over 60% since 2009.

And we feel really good about our ability to do that. I think clearly, with -- if you look at just the overall -- your question about earnings leverage, the headwind from UVS is meaningful. Certainly, what we have forecasted in 2016 is a meaningful headwind, with a pretty significant decline in pricing. These cycles happen in used truck sales. We know. They typically last 4 to 6 quarters, and it's typically just when supply and demand get out of whack a little bit. But we see us getting through this like we've gotten through them in the past.

There's a lot more uncertainty. And you've heard a lot of talk about the industrial recession and a softer freight environment from some of the truckers. We've seen it manifest itself right now in our used truck pricing a bit and clearly, a little bit more in rental. But that's why we felt it was prudent to really build this plan around that type of an environment. The truth is it could turn out to be better, and if it does, I think we're well positioned to capitalize on that. Certainly, our lease sales will be better. It could help our used truck pricing.

So by the end of the year, we expect that to be closer to the 6,000-unit range, so well within -- and again, that's primarily also because we don't have a lot of units coming up for renewal this year. Certainly, we're below the average. So that will kind of help us throughout the year. As it relates to the pricing of used tractors or used trucks, new technology versus old, I would tell you that our experience, certainly, through last year, prior to this downturn, was that the new -- we were getting the appropriate pricing on the new technology. So we've got to see how that plays out. We've got a team that's out, I think, doing a great job of marketing the new technology.

First, on the growth side, I think you hit it right. We had 11% growth on dry revenue. So first, make sure that you're working off the dry revenue number because the total revenue number is impacted by fuel changes, and the price of fuel is down 30%. But if you look at our base measure of operating revenue, we're up 11%, and that's been growing in the second half. We've had some pretty good traction with prior fleet conversions, and some of that is taking place in the second half of the year, so that's what impacted fourth quarter if you look at the sales and the prior fleet conversions we saw during the quarter. And then that momentum, we expect to carry over for the first half of 2016 and then it will temper in the second half of 2016."

So I don't see that as being dramatically different than what we've seen in the past. I would tell you also, remember, we hold vehicles 7 years, so we're still selling vehicles from 2009 in this year. And we're still at a point where there's not a lot of new units -- there's not big production years coming into our used truck environment. So I think that will bode well through this downturn. And as we get out of it, then we'll probably have some additional units coming in, and we'll be in a good position to sell them."

This morning, we'll recap our first quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business, then we'll open the call for questions.

This morning, we'll recap our first quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business, then we'll open the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our first quarter results. 
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.12 for the first quarter 2016, up 4% from the prior year. Comparable results were above our forecast range of $1.03 to $1.08, due to better than planned rental demand and used vehicle prices. First quarter comparable results excludes $0.07 of nonoperating pension costs in 2016 and $0.06 in the prior year. 2015 comparable earnings also exclude $0.02 in professionals fees. 
Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 8% to a record $1.4 billion for the first quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 9%. Total revenue increased by 4% and was impacted by lower fuel costs passed through to customers. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the first quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased to 53.4 million shares, up from 53.1 million shares last year. We expect to begin repurchasing shares under our previously announced 2 million shares anti dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter, earlier than previously anticipated. The plan allows management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015 and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 37.1 consistent with the prior year. I'll turn now to Page 6 and discuss key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. 
Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 7%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, FMS operating revenue was up 8%. Full service fleet revenue increased 8% due to the growth and high rate on a replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new engine technology. The lease we grew organically by 6,500 vehicles year-over-year excluding the impact from the planned reduction of U.K. trailers. 
Sequentially, the lease would increase by 1,700 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers. We continue to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends and our sales and marketing initiatives. During the quarter, we were pleased to see that over 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year. Miles driven per vehicle per day on U.S. leased power units were consistent with the prior year and continue to run at normal historical levels. 
Contract maintenance revenue increased by 9%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 5,400 vehicles from the prior year and 2,700 units sequentially, reflecting a significant new customer win. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 21% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,100 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, an increase of 9% from the prior year. Commercial Rental revenue was flat for the quarter. Global rental demand was up by nearly 2%, driven by higher truck demand, partially offset by lower demand for tractors. 
Although higher than planned, rental demand was a driver of the product line's better-than-expected results. Demand trends worsened through the quarter and April demand to date is lower than expected. Global pricing was flat for the quarter due to higher pre rental rates offset by lower lease support rates. The average rental fleet grew by 2% from the prior year. The ending rental fleet was down by 5% or 2,000 vehicles sequentially from the fourth quarter, consistent with our plan to position the rental fleet more conservatively for 2016 in light of softer expected demand conditions. 
Rental utilization on power units was 70.4%, down 300 basis points year-over-year, but still at a solid level for the seasonally low first quarter. Rental utilization was adversely impacted as we carried a higher fleet level than normal during the first quarter in order to maintain sufficient capacity for the peak rental season, given significantly lower rental capital spending for new vehicles this year. Although better than forecast, used vehicle results were down year-over-year due to lower pricing on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle results, higher insurance costs and the lack of an unusual fuel benefit realized in the prior year, partially offset by higher full service lease results. Earnings before tax and FMS decreased 8%. 
FMS earnings, as a percent of operating revenue, were 8.6%, down 140 basis points from the prior year. Of this 140 basis points decline, 130 basis points was due to used vehicle sales. I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 7. 
Operating and total revenue growth were strong at 15% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing. DTS earnings increased 59% due to higher operating revenue and lower insurance cost. Segment earnings before taxes, as a percent of operating revenue, were 7.5%, up 210 basis points from the prior year. I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 8. 
Operating revenue grew 9% or 11%, excluding foreign exchange, due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. Total revenue was up 5%, as higher operating revenue was partially offset by lower third-party purchase transportation cost and lower fuel cost passed through to customers. SCS earnings before tax were up 26% due to operating revenue growth. Segment earnings before tax, as a percent of operating revenue, were 6.1% for the quarter, up 80 basis points from the prior year. 
Page 9 shows the business segment view of the income statement I just discussed and is included here for your reference. At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

This decrease reflects lower planned rental capital spending. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $121 million, that's up $24 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher planned sales volumes and increased truck pricing, partially offset by lower tractor pricing. 
Overall, used vehicle pricing exceeded our expectations. Robert will cover that area in more detail next. First quarter net capital expenditures decreased by $179 million to $377 million. Turning to the next page. 
We generated cash from operating activities of $365 million for the quarter, up $81 million. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings and lower working capital needs. We generated $511 million of total cash during the year, up $114 million from the prior year, reflecting higher operating cash and sales proceeds. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by $22 million to $575 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $64 million, that's $92 million better than the prior year. Our full year free cash flow forecast remains at a positive $100 million.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.6 billion increased by $97 million from the prior year. Debt-to-equity at the end of the first quarter decreased to 274% from 277% at the end of 2015 and is within our target range of 225% to 275%. We expect our balance sheet leverage to come down a bit more quickly than planned and as a result, expect to reassume anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second quarter. 
Equity at the end of the quarter was just over $2 billion, that's up around $60 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by dividends. 
Before I hand it back over to Robert, I want to highlight one reporting change we made starting this quarter. Gains on vehicle sales on the P&L are now being shown net of valuation adjustments that previously had been included in depreciation and reported in other operating expenses. Valuation adjustments are made when a vehicle is moved to the used truck center if its book value is above recent sales prices and therefore, a loss is expected at the time of sale. Including this adjustment in the reported gains slide, provides a better picture of gains net of losses on vehicles to be sold. A table with quarterly history for the past 5 years under this approach is included on Page 19 in the appendix. 
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management updates."

Page 14 summarizes key results from our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 8,600 vehicles, up from 5,800 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 600 vehicles. This is above the high end of our target ran",952,"Thanks, Art. Page 14 summarizes key results from our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 8,600 vehicles, up from 5,800 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 600 vehicles. This is above the high end of our target range of 6,000 to 8,000, but consistent with our forecast. 
Higher used vehicle inventory levels reflect our decision to downsize the rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect inventory levels to decline over the next few quarters and we should end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range. We sold 4,700 used vehicles during the quarter, up 9% from the prior year and up 4% sequentially. 
Used vehicle pricing declined by somewhat less than we had initially forecast for the quarter. Although pricing conditions are still relatively weak, the rate of price decline slowed as the quarter progressed. Proceeds from vehicles sold were down 8% for tractors and up 6% for trucks compared to the prior year. 
From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was unchanged and truck pricing was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of 2015, overall used vehicle prices for power units were down 5% as compared to our expectation of down 9%. This is driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 12% from the second quarter peak, partially offset by truck pricing, which was up 2%. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 400 units or 30% during the quarter, although still below recessionary levels. The increase was driven by activity with 2 specific customers. Vehicles redeployed into other applications increased by almost 500 units or 76%. This reflects our actions to put excess rental vehicles into lease contracts as we downsize the rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles decreased by 450 units this year and were below levels seen over the past 6 years. I'll turn now to Page 16 and cover our outlook for 2016. 
During the first quarter, we delivered profitable growth as strong performance in our contractual businesses and cost actions taken early in the year helped us offset a challenging environment in used vehicle sales and rental. We generated strong revenue growth in all business segments, driven by growth in our contractual product lines. We're particularly encouraged by continued momentum in new sales contracts signed across all business segments. 
In Full Service Lease, we grew the fleet by 1,700 vehicles sequentially and our full year plan remains at 3,500 vehicles. Our outlook anticipates slower fleet growth in the second half of the year due to new vehicle production declines at OEMs and generally soft rate conditions. However, this trend has not materialized yet as we continue to see strong lease sales and strong new business pipeline during the quarter. We're also pleased that over 40% of our new lease tracks added during the quarter came from customers outsourcing for the first time. 
In Rental, we reached our planned goal to downsize the fleet by 5% or 2,000 units by the end of the quarter. Although we saw better-than-expected rental demand during the first quarter, April to late -- to date demand was lower than expected, particularly with tractors. As a result, we expect second quarter rental results to be below our initial forecast and are further reducing the fleet size. We now expect our full year average rental fleet to decline by 7% versus our prior forecast of 4%. This also -- we also expect rental pricing to be flat. We continue to focus on vehicle deployment, especially into lease and dedicated Asti strategy did complete mental without needing to sell as many units. 
In our asset life maintenance products, we're pleased with the strong growth in contract maintenance and continued market interest in our on-demand maintenance service. We are emphasizing growth in these products as a way to drive revenue and earnings with no capital investment required. 
In Used Vehicle sales, pricing with stronger than we anticipated during the quarter, but market conditions remained soft. Based on recent activity, including strong sales volumes in March and into April, we now expect to use vehicles sales results will be slightly better than our original forecast for the balance of the year. We expect inventory levels to decline going forward and end the year at the lower end of our target range at around 6,500 vehicles. 
In Supply chain, we continue to expect mid single-digits operating revenue growth based on strong sales activity. In dedicated, we expect high single-digit revenue growth for the year with the successful upselling of full service lease customers to dedicated continuing to be a key growth driver. 
Earnings comparisons in dedicated are expected to benefit from new sales and lower self-insurance expense. Our second quarter comparable EPS forecast is $1.50 to $1.55 versus our prior year of $1.65. This reflects weaker year-over-year performance in rental and used vehicle sales. Used vehicle sales comparisons will be the most unfavorable in the second quarter as used vehicle pricing peaked in the second quarter of last year. 
Due to ongoing uncertainty in rental and used vehicle sales, we're maintaining our full year EPS forecast range of $6.10 to $6.30, a flat to modest increase from the prior year, as the strength in our contractual businesses mitigates weakness with transactional products. We also plan to begin anti dilutive share repurchase activity in the second quarter, earlier than previously expected. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. At this time, I'll turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

First and foremost, there is some softness in general around tractor. You see it even in our rental fleet. There's also the strong dollar really impacting some of the offshore sales that were happening across the industry, which now you had the dollars coming down a little bit, so that might turn around. But still, that impacts tractors more, I think more tractors are being offshored. Then we have the issue around the 2011 and 2012 Navistar is that came into the market. Those were primarily tractors also, which really created some pricing pressure. And I think that's the combination of those things that's probably more heavily weighting the tractor issue than the stray truck issue."

And I think that's had a lot to do with some of the success that we're seeing there. Obviously, along with the secular trends that are out there that are making it more difficult for them to do their mobile maintenance and by their own trucks. But as an example, over the last 2 years, the team has done over 10,000 TCOs analysis with prospects. So that starts to chip away over time as customers really begin to see how much they can save by outsourcing versus doing things on their own.

This morning, we'll recap our first quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business, then we'll open the call for questions. With that, let's turn t",988,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This morning, we'll recap our first quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business, then we'll open the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our first quarter results.
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.12 for the first quarter 2016, up 4% from the prior year. Comparable results were above our forecast range of $1.03 to $1.08 due to better-than-planned rental demand and used vehicle prices. First quarter comparable results exclude $0.07 of nonoperating pension cost in 2016 and $0.06 in the prior year. 2015 comparable earnings also exclude $0.02 in professional fees.
Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 8% to a record $1.4 billion for the first quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 9%. Total revenue increased by 4% and was impacted by lower fuel cost passed through to customers.
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the first quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased to 53.4 million shares, up from 53.1 million shares last year. We expect to begin repurchasing shares under our previously announced 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter, earlier than previously anticipated. The plan allows management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015 and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. Excluding pension cost and other items, the comparable tax rate was 37.1%, consistent with the prior year. I'll turn now to Page 6 and discuss key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter.
Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 7%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, FMS operating revenue was up 8%. Full service lease revenue increased 8% due to fleet growth and higher rate on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new engine technology. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,500 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from the planned reduction of U.K. trailers. Sequentially, the lease fleet increased by 1,700 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers. We continue to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends in our sales and marketing initiatives. During the quarter, we were pleased to see that over 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Miles driven per vehicle per day on U.S. lease power units were consistent with the prior year and continue to run at normal historical levels. Contract maintenance revenue increased by 9%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 5,400 vehicles from the prior year and 2,700 units sequentially, reflecting a significant new customer win. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 21% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,100 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, an increase of 9% from the prior year.
Commercial rental revenue was flat for the quarter. Global rental demand was up by nearly 2%, driven by higher truck demand, partially offset by lower demand for tractors. Although higher than planned, rental demand was a driver of the product line's better-than-expected results. Demand trends worsened through the quarter and April demand to date is lower than expected. Global pricing was flat for the quarter due to higher pure rental rates, offset by lower lease support rates. The average rental fleet grew by 2% from the prior year. The ending rental fleet was down by 5% or 2,000 vehicles sequentially from the fourth quarter, consistent with our plan to position the rental fleet more conservatively for 2016 in light of softer expected demand conditions.
Rental utilization on power units was 70.4%, down 300 basis points year-over-year, but still at a solid level for the seasonally low first quarter. Rental utilization was adversely impacted as we carried a higher fleet level than normal during the first quarter in order to maintain sufficient capacity for the peak rental season, given significantly lower rental capital spending for new vehicles this year. Although better than forecast, used vehicle results were down year-over-year due to lower pricing on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes.
Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle results, higher insurance cost and the lack of an unusual fuel benefit realized in the prior year, partially offset by higher full service lease results. Earnings before tax in FMS decreased 8%.
FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 8.6%, down 140 basis points from the prior year. Of this 140 basis points decline, 130 basis points was due to used vehicle sales. I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 7.
Operating and total revenue growth were strong at 15% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing. DTS earnings increased 59% due to higher operating revenue and lower insurance cost. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 7.5%, up 210 basis points from the prior year. I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 8.
Operating revenue grew 9% or 11% excluding foreign exchange, due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. Total revenue was up 5% as higher operating revenue was partially offset by lower third-party purchased transportation cost and lower fuel cost passed through to customers. SCS earnings before tax were up 26% due to operating revenue growth. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 6.1% for the quarter, up 80 basis points from the prior year.
Page 9 shows the business segment view of the income statement I just discussed and is included here for your reference.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

This decrease reflects lower planned rental capital spending. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $121 million. That's up $24 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher planned sales volumes and increased truck pricing, partially offset by lower tractor pricing.
Overall, used vehicle pricing exceeded our expectations. Robert will cover that area in more detail next. First quarter net capital expenditures decreased by $179 million to $377 million. Turning to the next page.
We generated cash from operating activities of $365 million for the quarter, up $81 million. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings and lower working capital needs. We generated $511 million of total cash during the year, up $114 million from the prior year, reflecting higher operating cash and sales proceeds. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by $22 million to $575 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $64 million. That's $92 million better than the prior year. Our full year free cash flow forecast remains at a positive $100 million.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.6 billion increased by $97 million from the prior year. Debt-to-equity at the end of the first quarter decreased to 274% from 277% at the end of 2015 and is within our target range of 225% to 275%. We expect our balance sheet leverage to come down a bit more quickly than planned and as a result, expect to resume anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second quarter.
Equity at the end of the quarter was just over $2 billion. That's up around $60 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by dividends.
Before I hand it back to Robert, I want to highlight one reporting change we made starting this quarter. Gains on vehicle sales on the P&L are now being shown net of valuation adjustments that previously had been included in depreciation and reported in other operating expenses. Valuation adjustments are made when a vehicle is moved to the used truck center if its book value is above recent sales prices and therefore, a loss is expected at the time of sale. Including this adjustment in the reported gains line provides a better picture of gains net of losses on vehicles to be sold. A table with quarterly history for the past 5 years under this approach is included on Page 19 in the appendix.
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Page 14 summarizes key results from our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 8,600 vehicles, up from 5,800 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 600 vehicles. This is above the high end of our target ran",953,"Thanks, Art. Page 14 summarizes key results from our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 8,600 vehicles, up from 5,800 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 600 vehicles. This is above the high end of our target range of 6,000 to 8,000, but consistent with our forecast.
Higher used vehicle inventory levels reflect our decision to downsize the rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect inventory levels to decline over the next few quarters, and we should end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range. We sold 4,700 used vehicles during the quarter, up 9% from the prior year and up 4% sequentially.
Used vehicle pricing declined by somewhat less than we had initially forecast for the quarter. Although pricing conditions are still relatively weak, the rate of price decline slowed as the quarter progressed. Proceeds from vehicles sold were down 8% for tractors and up 6% for trucks compared to the prior year.
From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was unchanged and truck pricing was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of 2015, overall used vehicle prices for power units were down 5% as compared to our expectation of down 9%. This is driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 12% from the second quarter peak, partially offset by truck pricing which was up 2%.
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 400 units or 30% during the quarter, although still below recessionary levels. The increase was driven by activity with 2 specific customers. Vehicles redeployed into other applications increased by almost 500 units or 76%. This reflects our actions to put excess rental vehicles into lease contracts as we downsize the rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles decreased by 450 units this year and were below levels seen over the past 6 years. I'll turn now to Page 16 and cover our outlook for 2016.
During the first quarter, we delivered profitable growth as strong performance in our contractual businesses and cost actions taken early in the year helped us offset a challenging environment in used vehicle sales and rental. We generated strong revenue growth in all business segments, driven by growth in our contractual product lines. We're particularly encouraged by continued momentum in new sales contracts signed across all business segments.
In full service lease, we grew the fleet by 1,700 vehicles sequentially and our full year plan remains at 3,500 vehicles. Our outlook anticipates slower fleet growth in the second half of the year due to new vehicle production declines at OEMs and generally soft freight conditions. However, this trend has not materialized yet as we continue to see strong lease sales and strong new business pipeline during the quarter. We're also pleased that over 40% of our new lease trucks added during the quarter came from customers outsourcing for the first time.
In rental, we reached our planned goal to downsize the fleet by 5% or 2,000 units by year -- by the end of the quarter. Although we saw better-than-expected rental demand during the first quarter, April to late -- to date demand was lower than expected, particularly with tractors. As a result, we expect second quarter rental results to be below our initial forecast and are further reducing the fleet size. We now expect our full year average rental fleet to decline by 7% versus our prior forecast of 4%. This also -- we also expect rental pricing to be flat. We continue to focus on vehicle redeployment especially into lease and dedicated as a strategy to deflate rental without needing to sell as many units.
In our asset-light maintenance products, we're pleased with the strong growth in contract maintenance and continued market interest in our on-demand maintenance service. We are emphasizing growth in these products as a way to drive revenue and earnings with no capital investment required.
In used vehicle sales, pricing was stronger than we anticipated during the quarter, but market conditions remain soft. Based on recent activity, including strong sales volumes in March and into April, we now expect used vehicle sales results will be slightly better than our original forecast for the balance of the year. We expect inventory levels to decline going forward and end the year at the lower end of our target range at around 6,500 vehicles.
In supply chain, we continue to expect mid-single digits operating revenue growth based on strong sales activity. In dedicated, we expect high single-digit revenue growth for the year with the successful upselling of full service lease customers to dedicated continuing to be a key growth driver.
Earnings comparisons in dedicated are expected to benefit from new sales and lower self-insurance expense. Our second quarter comparable EPS forecast is $1.50 to $1.55 versus our prior year of $1.65. This reflects weaker year-over-year performance in rental and used vehicle sales. Used vehicle sales comparisons will be the most unfavorable in the second quarter as used vehicle pricing peaked in the second quarter of last year.
Due to ongoing uncertainty in rental and used vehicle sales, we're maintaining our full year EPS forecast range of $6.10 to $6.30, a flat to modest increase from the prior year, as the strength in our contractual businesses mitigates weakness with transactional products. We also plan to begin anti-dilutive share repurchase activity in the second quarter, earlier than previously expected.
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. At this time, I'll turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

There's also the strong dollar really impacting some of the offshore sales that were happening across the industry, which now the dollar is coming down a little bit so that might turn around. But still, that impacts tractors more and I think more tractors are being offshored. Then we had the issue around the 2011 and 2012 Navistars that came into the market. Those are primarily tractors also, which really created some pricing pressure. And I think that's -- it's the combination of those things that's probably more heavily weighting the tractor issue than the straight truck issue."

In terms of the mix of tractors to straight trucks, I believe that there is more -- there's probably more tractors than there is straight trucks, but I don't know the exact percentages. Do you have those, Dennis?"

This morning, we'll recap our first quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business, then we'll open the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our first quarter results.
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.12 for the first quarter 2016, up 4% from the prior year. Comparable results were above our forecast range of $1.03 to $1.08 due to better-than-planned rental demand and used vehicle prices. First quarter comparable results exclude $0.07 of nonoperating pension cost in 2016 and $0.06 in the prior year. 2015 comparable earnings also exclude $0.02 in professional fees.
Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 8% to a record $1.4 billion for the first quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 9%. Total revenue increased by 4% and was impacted by lower fuel cost passed through to customers.
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the first quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased to 53.4 million shares, up from 53.1 million shares last year. We expect to begin repurchasing shares under our previously announced 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter, earlier than previously anticipated. The plan allows management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. Excluding pension cost and other items, the comparable tax rate was 37.1%, consistent with the prior year. I'll turn now to Page 6 and discuss key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter.
Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 7%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, FMS operating revenue was up 8%. Full service lease revenue increased 8% due to fleet growth and higher rate on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new engine technology. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,500 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from the planned reduction of U.K. trailers. Sequentially, the lease fleet increased by 1,700 vehicles, excluding U.K. trailers. We continue to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends in our sales and marketing initiatives. During the quarter, we were pleased to see that over 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Miles driven per vehicle per day on U.S. lease power units were consistent with the prior year and continue to run at normal historical levels. Contract maintenance revenue increased by 9%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 5,400 vehicles from the prior year and 2,700 units sequentially, reflecting a significant new customer win. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 21% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,100 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, an increase of 9% from the prior year.
Commercial rental revenue was flat for the quarter. Global rental demand was up by nearly 2%, driven by higher truck demand, partially offset by lower demand for tractors. Although higher than planned, rental demand was a driver of the product line's better-than-expected results. Demand trends worsened through the quarter, and April demand to date is lower than expected. Global pricing was flat for the quarter due to higher pure rental rates, offset by lower lease support rates. The average rental fleet grew by 2% from the prior year. The ending rental fleet was down by 5% or 2,000 vehicles sequentially from the fourth quarter, consistent with our plan to position the rental fleet more conservatively for 2016 in light of softer expected demand conditions.
Rental utilization on power units was 70.4%, down 300 basis points year-over-year, but still at a solid level for the seasonally low first quarter. Rental utilization was adversely impacted as we carried a higher fleet level than normal during the first quarter in order to maintain sufficient capacity for the peak rental season, given significantly lower rental capital spending for new vehicles this year. Although better than forecast, used vehicle results were down year-over-year due to lower pricing on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes.
Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle results, higher insurance cost and the lack of an unusual fuel benefit realized in the prior year, partially offset by higher full service lease results. Earnings before tax in FMS decreased 8%.
FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 8.6%, down 140 basis points from the prior year. Of this 140 basis points decline, 130 basis points was due to used vehicle sales. I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 7.
Operating and total revenue growth were strong at 15% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing. DTS earnings increased 59% due to higher operating revenue and lower insurance cost. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 7.5%, up 210 basis points from the prior year. I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 8.
Operating revenue grew 9% or 11% excluding foreign exchange, due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. Total revenue was up 5% as higher operating revenue was partially offset by lower third-party purchased transportation cost and lower fuel cost passed through to customers. SCS earnings before tax were up 26% due to operating revenue growth. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 6.1% for the quarter, up 80 basis points from the prior year.
Page 9 shows the business segment view of the income statement I just discussed and is included here for your reference.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

This decrease reflects lower planned rental capital spending. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $121 million. That's up $24 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher planned sales volumes and increased truck pricing, partially offset by lower tractor pricing.
Overall, used vehicle pricing exceeded our expectations. Robert will cover that area in more detail next. First quarter net capital expenditures decreased by $179 million to $377 million. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $365 million for the quarter, up $81 million. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings and lower working capital needs. We generated $511 million of total cash during the year, up $114 million from the prior year, reflecting higher operating cash and sales proceeds. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by $22 million to $575 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $64 million. That's $92 million better than the prior year. Our full year free cash flow forecast remains at a positive $100 million.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.6 billion increased by $97 million from the prior year. Debt-to-equity at the end of the first quarter decreased to 274% from 277% at the end of 2015 and is within our target range of 225% to 275%. We expect our balance sheet leverage to come down a bit more quickly than planned and as a result, expect to resume anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second quarter.
Equity at the end of the quarter was just over $2 billion. That's up around $60 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by dividends.
Before I hand it back to Robert, I want to highlight one reporting change we made starting this quarter. Gains on vehicle sales on the P&L are now being shown net of valuation adjustments that previously had been included in depreciation and reported in other operating expenses. Valuation adjustments are made when a vehicle is moved to the used truck center if its book value is above recent sales prices and therefore, a loss is expected at the time of sale. Including this adjustment in the reported gains line provides a better picture of gains net of losses on vehicles to be sold. A table with quarterly history for the past 5 years under this approach is included on Page 19 in the appendix.
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Page 14 summarizes key results from our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 8,600 vehicles, up from 5,800 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 600 vehicles. This is above the high end of our target ran",953,"Thanks, Art. Page 14 summarizes key results from our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 8,600 vehicles, up from 5,800 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 600 vehicles. This is above the high end of our target range of 6,000 to 8,000, but consistent with our forecast.
Higher used vehicle inventory levels reflect our decision to downsize the rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect inventory levels to decline over the next few quarters, and we should end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range. We sold 4,700 used vehicles during the quarter, up 9% from the prior year and up 4% sequentially.
Used vehicle pricing declined by somewhat less than we had initially forecast for the quarter. Although pricing conditions are still relatively weak, the rate of price decline slowed as the quarter progressed. Proceeds from vehicles sold were down 8% for tractors and up 6% for trucks compared to the prior year.
From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was unchanged and truck pricing was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of 2015, overall used vehicle prices for power units were down 5% as compared to our expectation of down 9%. This is driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 12% from the second quarter peak, partially offset by truck pricing, which was up 2%.
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 400 units or 30% during the quarter, although still below recessionary levels. The increase was driven by activity with 2 specific customers. Vehicles redeployed into other applications increased by almost 500 units or 76%. This reflects our actions to put excess rental vehicles into lease contracts as we downsize the rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles decreased by 450 units this year and were below levels seen over the past 6 years. I'll turn now to Page 16 and cover our outlook for 2016.
During the first quarter, we delivered profitable growth as strong performance in our contractual businesses and cost actions taken early in the year helped us offset a challenging environment in used vehicle sales and rental. We generated strong revenue growth in all business segments, driven by growth in our contractual product lines. We're particularly encouraged by continued momentum in new sales contracts signed across all business segments.
In full service lease, we grew the fleet by 1,700 vehicles sequentially, and our full year plan remains at 3,500 vehicles. Our outlook anticipates slower fleet growth in the second half of the year due to new vehicle production declines at OEMs and generally soft freight conditions. However, this trend has not materialized yet as we continue to see strong lease sales and strong new business pipeline during the quarter. We're also pleased that over 40% of our new lease trucks added during the quarter came from customers outsourcing for the first time.
In rental, we reached our planned goal to downsize the fleet by 5% or 2,000 units by year -- by the end of the quarter. Although we saw better-than-expected rental demand during the first quarter, April to late -- to date demand was lower than expected, particularly with tractors. As a result, we expect second quarter rental results to be below our initial forecast and are further reducing the fleet size. We now expect our full year average rental fleet to decline by 7% versus our prior forecast of 4%. This also -- we also expect rental pricing to be flat. We continue to focus on vehicle redeployment especially into lease and dedicated as a strategy to deflate rental without needing to sell as many units.
In our asset-light maintenance products, we're pleased with the strong growth in contract maintenance and continued market interest in our on-demand maintenance service. We are emphasizing growth in these products as a way to drive revenue and earnings with no capital investment required.
In used vehicle sales, pricing was stronger than we anticipated during the quarter, but market conditions remain soft. Based on recent activity, including strong sales volumes in March and into April, we now expect used vehicle sales results will be slightly better than our original forecast for the balance of the year. We expect inventory levels to decline going forward and end the year at the lower end of our target range at around 6,500 vehicles.
In supply chain, we continue to expect mid-single digits operating revenue growth based on strong sales activity. In dedicated, we expect high single-digit revenue growth for the year with the successful upselling of full service lease customers to dedicated continuing to be a key growth driver.
Earnings comparisons in dedicated are expected to benefit from new sales and lower self-insurance expense. Our second quarter comparable EPS forecast is $1.50 to $1.55 versus our prior year of $1.65. This reflects weaker year-over-year performance in rental and used vehicle sales. Used vehicle sales comparisons will be the most unfavorable in the second quarter as used vehicle pricing peaked in the second quarter of last year.
Due to ongoing uncertainty in rental and used vehicle sales, we're maintaining our full year EPS forecast range of $6.10 to $6.30, a flat to modest increase from the prior year, as the strength in our contractual businesses mitigates weakness with transactional products. We also plan to begin anti-dilutive share repurchase activity in the second quarter, earlier than previously expected.
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. At this time, I'll turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

First and foremost, there is some softness in general around tractors. You see it even in our rental fleet. There's also the strong dollar really impacting some of the offshore sales that were happening across the industry, which now the dollar is coming down a little bit so that might turn around. But still, that impacts tractors more and I think more tractors are being offshored. Then we had the issue around the 2011 and 2012 Navistars that came into the market. Those are primarily tractors also, which really created some pricing pressure. And I think that's -- it's the combination of those things that's probably more heavily weighting the tractor issue than the straight truck issue."

This morning, we'll recap our second quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our second quarter results. 
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations or $1.56 for the second quarter of 2016, down 5% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 comparable results exclude $0.09 of nonoperating pension cost, as well as $0.09 of pension-related charges from certain benefit improvements made in 2009 that were not fully reflected in our projected benefit obligation. 
Last year, comparable earnings excluded $0.05 of nonoperating pension cost, $0.02 in professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives and $0.03 in benefits from state law changes. 
Despite a challenging freight environment that impacted our rental and used vehicle businesses, results were modestly above our comparable forecast range of $1.50 to $1.55, reflecting organic growth in our contractual businesses and lower overheads. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation, grew by 4% to a record $1.4 billion for the second quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 5%.
Total revenue increased by 2% and was impacted by lower fuel costs passed through to customers. Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the second quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased slightly to 53.4 million shares, up from 53.3 million shares last year. We began implementing our previously announced 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter, earlier than originally anticipated. The plan allows management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. During the quarter, we bought approximately 322,000 shares at an average price of $68.05.
Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 36.9%, largely consistent with the prior year. Page 6 highlights financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. 
Operating revenue grew 6% to $2.9 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.68, down 1% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital decreased to 120 basis points, down from 140 basis points in the prior year, driven primarily by lower performance in commercial rental and used vehicle sales. 
For the full year 2016, we now expect this spread to be 100 basis points at the low end of our prior forecast range of 100 to 110 basis points, reflecting lower expected Commercial Rental performance. I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss some key trend that we saw in the business segments during the quarter. 
Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 4%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease. Please revenue increased 9% due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles reflecting the higher costs of new vehicles. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,500 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from the planned reduction of U.K. trailers. Sequentially, the lease fleet increased by 1,300 units, excluding U.K. trailers, bringing our year-to-date lease fleet growth to 3,000 vehicles. We continue to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends, as well as our sales and marketing initiatives. So far this year, approximately 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Contract maintenance revenue increased 4%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 6,200 vehicles from the prior year and 1,500 sequentially reflecting new customer wins. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 11% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,600 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, a decrease of 8% from the prior year, but sequentially up 7%. 
Commercial rental revenue was down 10% for the quarter. Global rental demand was lower by 9%, driven primarily by lower demand for tractors. Global pricing on power units decreased nearly 1% for the quarter. The average rental fleet decreased 7% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down by 3% or 1,400 vehicles sequentially from the first quarter and down 11% or 5,000 vehicles year-over-year as our centralized asset management team executed our plan to shrink the rental fleet in light of softer demand. We've downsided the rental fleet by both we deploying vehicles into lease contracts and taking vehicles to our used truck centers for sale.
Vehicles redeployed into other applications nearly doubled from last year. This activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow. Rental utilization on power units was 74.7, down 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower tractor demand. 
Used vehicles results were down year-over-year due to lower used vehicle pricing primarily on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower commercial rental results and lower used vehicle pricings, partially offset by higher full-service fleets results. Earnings before taxes and FMS decreased 9%. FMS earnings, as a percent of operating revenue, were 11.2%, down 160 basis points from the prior year. Used vehicle performance negatively impacted year-over-year EBT margins by 200 basis points.
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 8. We continue to see strong revenue growth in dedicated driven by upselling lease customers into driver services, as well as new outsourcing activity. Total revenue grew 16% and operating revenue was up 10%, due to new business, as well as higher pricing and volumes. 
DTS earnings increased 32% due to lower self-insurance cost and operating revenue growth. Segment earnings before taxes, as a percent of operating revenue, were 8.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. 
Total revenue was up 1%, as higher operating revenue was partially offset by lower third party purchased transportation cost and lower field cost passed through to customers. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. SCS earnings before taxes were up 2%, primarily driven by new business. Segment earnings before taxes, as a percent of operating revenue, were 8.6% for the quarter, down 10 basis points from the prior year. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

Year-to-date gross capital expenditures were just over $1 billion, down $439 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet, as well as greater amount of used equipment to fulfill lease contracts. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue earning equipment of $252 million, up $40 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher sales volume, partially offset by lower used vehicle pricing. Net capital expenditures decreased by almost $500 million to $763 million. Full year 2016 gross capital expenditures are now expected to be $1.9 billion, down from $2 billion in our initial forecast. This primarily reflects a greater proportion of used equipment fulfilling lease contracts.
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $763 million year-to-date, up 16%. The increase was driven primarily by lower working capital requirements and higher cash-based earnings. We generated around $1.1 billion of total cash year-to-date, up $155 million or 17% from the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million to $1.12 billion year-to-date. The company's free cash flow was negative $62 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $425 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures, higher operating cash flow and increased sales proceeds. We are increasing our full year 2016 forecast for fee cash flow to $200 million, that's up from our previous forecast of $100 million. This change primarily reflects the cash flow benefit from the redeployment of used equipment to fulfill new lease contracts.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.6 billion increased by $131 million from year-end 2015. Debt to equity at the end of the first quarter decreased to 275% from 277% at the end of the year, and is at the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%. 
Despite a stronger free cash flow outlook, year-end debt to equity is forecast to be higher than initially planned due to foreign exchange rates and the pension impact to equity from lower interest rates. We now expect to end the year with a debt-to-equity ratio of 255%, that's 10 percentage points higher than initially planned and just above the mid-point of our target range. 
Equity at the end of the quarter was just under $2.05 billion, up $60 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends.
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

The used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 9,100 vehicles, up from 5,900 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 500 vehicles. 
Current inventory levels are above our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 and reflect actions taken to reduce of the size of our rental fleet. We expect second quarter to be the peak for used vehicle inventory, which should decline to around the top end of our range by year-end. We sold 5,100 used vehicles during the quarter, up by 9% from both the prior year and sequentially. Proceeds for vehicles sold were down 15% for tractors and down 4% for trucks compared to peak prices a year ago.
From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 4% and truck pricing was down 6% versus the first quarter 2016. The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 775 units year-to-date, but was similar to the levels from the prior few years. Vehicles redeployed into other applications nearly doubled to almost 2,700 units year-to-date. This reflect our actions to place excess rental vehicles into lease or dedicated contracts as we downside the rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by around 250 units this year, reflecting higher customer bankruptcies. I'll turn now to Page 16 to cover our outlook for 2016.
During the second quarter, we continue to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in our rental and used vehicle sales by growing our contractual businesses, taking timely action to rightsize the rental fleet and managing our cost. 
Revenue grew in all business segments, driven by growth in our contractual product lines. In May, we launched 2 new flexible maintenance products, ChoiceLease Preventative and ChoiceLease On-demand, which are first for our industry. These products provide customers with new options to obtain leasing and maintenance services as we continue to find innovative ways to penetrate the large non-outsourced market. 
In full service lease, we grew by 3,000 vehicles year-to-date, excluding U.K. trailers. We're increasing our full year outlook for the lease fleet growth from 3,500 vehicles to 4,000 vehicles, reflecting higher levels of redeployment activity in the first half of the year. We're also pleased that around 40% of new trucks added this year have come from customers outsourcing for the first time. 
In rental, we lowered our demand outlook for the balance of the year in light of the soft conditions in the Class A tractor market and now expects rental demand to be down by 9% for the full year versus 7% in our previous forecast.
July demand trend to date have been slightly worse than June, and we're forecasting this to continue into the third quarter. We believe year-over-year demand comparisons will bottom out in the third quarter as we move into easier comparisons later in the year.
Despite weaker demand expectations in the third quarter, we expect less negative earnings impact due to the actions we've already taken to reduce the fleet size. We've largely completed the rental fleet reductions needed to account for a softer demand environment, but our planning in additional normal seasonal be fleeting in the latter part of the year.
We now expect our year-end rental fleet to decline by 11% as compared to prior expectation of down 8%. The full year average fleet should be down by 8% versus our prior forecast of 7%. We expect global rental pricing to be flat in the second half of the year.
In our asset light maintenance products, we're pleased with continued growth in contract maintenance and market interest in our on-demand maintenance service. We're emphasizing growth in these products as a way to drive revenue and earnings with no additional capital investment required. In used vehicle sales, we expect pricing to be generally consistent with recent trends on a somewhat -- on somewhat lower sales volumes. Our outlook for Class A tractor pricing remains unchanged at 16% to 17% down for the full year. We believe our used vehicle inventories have peaked in the second quarter and should decline in the second half to around 8,000 vehicles.
In supply chain, we expect mid single-digit operating revenue growth with stable earnings for the balance of the year. In dedicated, operating revenue is expected to grow by high single-digits for the full year, although year-over-year growth rates will be lower in the second half due to the timing of new sales.
We expect solid year-over-year base comparisons to continue for dedicated. We're reducing our full year comparable EPS forecast to 5 90 to 6 05 from 6 10 to 6 30, primarily due to our lower outlook for rental demand and used vehicle volumes, particularly Class A tractors.

In July, we're actually down -- we're seeing it as down about 20%, 21%. 
So we're seeing it get down at the levels that I think that historically, we've seen during downturns year-over-year comps get down into that level of 20%, 21%. So as we look out to the second quarter, we're expecting that to continue in the second quarter. We're looking second half is going to be down about 20%. And then when you look at year-over-year comps, you start to see that they get easier also. So that's kind of why we're forecasting that demand is certainly, the comps are going to get better and the year-over-year declines will get a little bit better."

This morning, we'll recap our second quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our second quarter results.
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56 for the second quarter of 2016, down 5% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 comparable results exclude $0.09 of nonoperating pension costs as well as $0.09 of pension-related charges from certain benefit improvements made in 2009 that were not fully reflected in our projected benefit obligation.
Last year, comparable earnings excluded $0.05 of nonoperating pension costs, $0.02 in professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives and $0.03 in benefits from state law changes.
Despite a challenging freight environment that impacted our rental and used vehicle businesses, results were modestly above our comparable forecast range of $1.50 to $1.55, reflecting organic growth in our contractual businesses and lower overheads. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation, grew by 4% to a record $1.4 billion for the second quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 5%. Total revenue increased by 2% and was impacted by lower fuel cost passed through to customers.
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the second quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased slightly to 53.4 million shares, up from 53.3 million shares last year. We began implementing our previously announced 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter, earlier than originally anticipated. The plan allows management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. During the quarter, we bought approximately 322,000 shares at an average price of $68.05. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 36.9%, largely consistent with the prior year.
Page 6 highlights financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. Operating revenue grew 6% to $2.9 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.68, down 1% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital decreased to 120 basis points, down from 140 basis points in the prior year, driven primarily by lower performance in commercial rental and used vehicle sales. For the full year 2016, we now expect this spread to be 100 basis points, at the low end of our prior forecast range of 100 to 110 basis points, reflecting lower expected commercial rental performance.
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss some key trends that we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 4%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease. Lease revenue increased 9% due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new vehicles. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,500 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from the planned reduction of U.K. trailers. Sequentially, the lease fleet increased by 1,300 units, excluding U.K. trailers, bringing our year-to-date lease fleet growth to 3,000 vehicles. We continue to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as our sales and marketing initiatives. So far this year, approximately 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Contract maintenance revenue increased 4%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 6,200 vehicles from the prior year and 1,500 sequentially reflecting new customer wins. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 11% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,600 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, a decrease of 8% from the prior year, but sequentially up 7%.
Commercial rental revenue was down 10% for the quarter. Global rental demand was lower by 9%, driven primarily by lower demand for tractors. Global pricing on power units decreased nearly 1% for the quarter. The average rental fleet decreased 7% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down by 3% or 1,400 vehicles sequentially from the first quarter and down 11% or 5,000 vehicles year-over-year as our centralized asset management team executed our plan to shrink the rental fleet in light of softer demand. We've downsized the rental fleet by both redeploying vehicles into lease contracts and taking vehicles to our used truck centers for sale.
Vehicles redeployed into other applications nearly doubled from last year. This activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow. Rental utilization on power units was 74.7%, down 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower tractor demand.
Used vehicles results were down year-over-year due to lower used vehicle pricing, primarily on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower commercial rental results and lower used vehicle pricing, partially offset by higher full service lease results. Earnings before taxes in FMS decreased 9%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 11.2%, down 160 basis points from the prior year. Used vehicle performance negatively impacted year-over-year EBT margins by 200 basis points.
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 8. We continue to see strong revenue growth in dedicated driven by upselling lease customers into driver services as well as new outsourcing activity. Total revenue grew 16% and operating revenue was up 10% due to new business as well as higher pricing and volumes.
DTS earnings increased 32% due to lower self-insurance cost and operating revenue growth. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Total revenue was up 1% as higher operating revenue was partially offset by lower third-party purchased transportation cost and lower field cost passed through to customers. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. SCS earnings before taxes were up 2%, primarily driven by new business. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.6% for the quarter, down 10 basis points from the prior year.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

Year-to-date gross capital expenditures were just over $1 billion, down $439 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet as well as greater amount of used equipment to fulfill lease contracts. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $252 million, up $40 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher sales volume, partially offset by lower used vehicle pricing. Net capital expenditures decreased by almost $500 million to $763 million. Full year 2016 gross capital expenditures are now expected to be $1.9 billion, down from $2 billion in our initial forecast. This primarily reflects a greater proportion of used equipment fulfilling lease contracts.
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $763 million year-to-date, up 16%. The increase was driven primarily by lower working capital requirements and higher cash-based earnings. We generated around $1.1 billion of total cash year-to-date, up $155 million or 17% from the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million to $1.12 billion year-to-date. The company's free cash flow was negative $62 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $425 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures, higher operating cash flow and increased sales proceeds. We are increasing our full year 2016 forecast for free cash flow to $200 million. That's up from our previous forecast of $100 million. This change primarily reflects the cash flow benefit from the redeployment of used equipment to fulfill new lease contracts.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.6 billion increased by $131 million from year-end 2015. Debt to equity at the end of the first quarter decreased to 275% from 277% at the end of the year, and is at the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%.
Despite a stronger free cash flow outlook, year-end debt to equity is forecast to be higher than initially planned due to foreign exchange rates and the pension impact to equity from lower interest rates. We now expect to end the year with a debt-to-equity ratio of 255%. That's 10 percentage points higher than initially planned and just above the midpoint of our target range.
Equity at the end of the quarter was just under $2.05 billion, up $60 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends.
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Page 14 summarizes key results of our asset management area. The used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 9,100 vehicles, up from 5,900 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 500 vehicles.
Current inventory levels are above our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 and reflect actions taken to reduce the size of our rental fleet. We expect second quarter to be the peak for used vehicle inventory, which should decline to around the top end of our range by year-end. We sold 5,100 used vehicles during the quarter, up by 9% from both the prior year and sequentially. Proceeds for vehicles sold were down 15% for tractors and down 4% for trucks compared to peak prices a year ago.
From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 4% and truck pricing was down 6% versus the first quarter 2016. The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 775 units year-to-date, but was similar to the levels from the prior few years. Vehicles redeployed into other applications nearly doubled to almost 2,700 units year-to-date. This reflects our actions to place excess rental vehicles into lease or dedicated contracts as we downsize the rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by around 250 units this year, reflecting higher customer bankruptcies.
I'll turn now to Page 16 to cover our outlook for 2016. During the second quarter, we continue to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in our rental and used vehicle sales by growing our contractual businesses, taking timely action to rightsize the rental fleet and managing our cost.
Revenue grew in all business segments, driven by growth in our contractual product lines. In May, we launched 2 new flexible maintenance products: ChoiceLease Preventive and ChoiceLease On-Demand, which are first for our industry. These products provide customers with new options to obtain leasing and maintenance services as we continue to find innovative ways to penetrate the large non-outsourced market.
In full service lease, we grew by 3,000 vehicles year-to-date, excluding U.K. trailers. We're increasing our full year outlook for the lease fleet growth from 3,500 vehicles to 4,000 vehicles, reflecting higher levels of redeployment activity in the first half of the year. We're also pleased that around 40% of new trucks added this year have come from customers outsourcing for the first time.
In rental, we lowered our demand outlook for the balance of the year in light of the soft conditions in the Class 8 tractor market and now expect rental demand to be down by 9% for the full year versus 7% in our previous forecast.
July demand trends to date have been slightly worse than June, and we're forecasting this to continue into the third quarter. We believe year-over-year demand comparisons will bottom out in the third quarter as we move into easier comparisons later in the year.
Despite weaker demand expectations in the third quarter, we expect less negative earnings impact due to the actions we've already taken to reduce the fleet size. We've largely completed the rental fleet reductions needed to account for a softer demand environment, but are planning an additional normal seasonal de-fleeting in the latter part of the year.
We now expect our year-end rental fleet to decline by 11% as compared to our prior expectation of down 8%. The full year average fleet should be down by 8% versus our prior forecast of 7%. We expect global rental pricing to be flat in the second half of the year.
In our asset-light maintenance products, we're pleased with continued growth in contract maintenance and market interest in our on-demand maintenance service. We're emphasizing growth in these products as a way to drive revenue and earnings with no additional capital investment required. In used vehicle sales, we expect pricing to be generally consistent with recent trends on a somewhat -- on somewhat lower sales volumes. Our outlook for Class 8 tractor pricing remains unchanged at 16% to 17% down for the full year. We believe our used vehicle inventories have peaked in the second quarter and should decline in the second half to around 8,000 vehicles.
In supply chain, we expect mid-single digit operating revenue growth with stable earnings for the balance of the year. In dedicated, operating revenue is expected to grow by high single digits for the full year, although year-over-year growth rates will be lower in the second half due to the timing of new sales. We expect solid year-over-year earnings comparisons to continue for dedicated. We're reducing our full year comparable EPS forecast to $5.90 to $6.05 from $6.10 to $6.30, primarily due to our lower outlook for rental demand and used vehicle volumes, particularly Class 8 tractors. Our third quarter comparable EPS forecast is $1.65 to $1.72 versus our prior -- versus the prior year of $1.74.

So we're seeing it get down to the levels that I think that historically we've seen during downturns year-over-year comps get down into that level of 20%, 21%. So as we look out to the second quarter, we're expecting that to continue in the second quarter. We're looking at -- second half is going to be down about 20%. And then when you look at year-over-year comps, you start to see that they get easier also.

This morning, we'll recap our second quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our second quarter results.
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56 for the second quarter of 2016, down 5% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 comparable results exclude $0.09 of nonoperating pension costs as well as $0.09 of pension-related charges from certain benefit improvements made in 2009 that were not fully reflected in our projected benefit obligation.
Last year, comparable earnings excluded $0.05 of nonoperating pension costs, $0.02 in professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives and $0.03 in benefits from state law changes.
Despite a challenging freight environment that impacted our rental and used vehicle businesses, results were modestly above our comparable forecast range of $1.50 to $1.55, reflecting organic growth in our contractual businesses and lower overheads. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation, grew by 4% to a record $1.4 billion for the second quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 5%. Total revenue increased by 2% and was impacted by lower fuel cost passed through to customers.
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the second quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased slightly to 53.4 million shares, up from 53.3 million shares last year. We began implementing our previously announced 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter, earlier than originally anticipated. The plan allows management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. During the quarter, we bought approximately 322,000 shares at an average price of $68.05. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 36.9%, largely consistent with the prior year.
Page 6 highlights financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. Operating revenue grew 6% to $2.9 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.68, down 1% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital decreased to 120 basis points, down from 140 basis points in the prior year, driven primarily by lower performance in commercial rental and used vehicle sales. For the full year 2016, we now expect this spread to be 100 basis points, at the low end of our prior forecast range of 100 to 110 basis points, reflecting lower expected commercial rental performance.
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss some key trends that we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 4%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease. Lease revenue increased 9% due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new vehicles. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,500 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from the planned reduction of U.K. trailers. Sequentially, the lease fleet increased by 1,300 units, excluding U.K. trailers, bringing our year-to-date lease fleet growth to 3,000 vehicles. We continue to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as our sales and marketing initiatives. So far this year, approximately 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Contract maintenance revenue increased 4%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 6,200 vehicles from the prior year and 1,500 sequentially reflecting new customer wins. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 11% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,600 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, a decrease of 8% from the prior year, but sequentially up 7%.
Commercial rental revenue was down 10% for the quarter. Global rental demand was lower by 9%, driven primarily by lower demand for tractors. Global pricing on power units decreased nearly 1% for the quarter. The average rental fleet decreased 7% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down by 3% or 1,400 vehicles sequentially from the first quarter and down 11% or 5,000 vehicles year-over-year as our centralized asset management team executed our plan to shrink the rental fleet in light of softer demand. We've downsized the rental fleet by both redeploying vehicles into lease contracts and taking vehicles to our used truck centers for sale.
Vehicles redeployed into other applications nearly doubled from last year. This activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow. Rental utilization on power units was 74.7%, down 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower tractor demand.
Used vehicles results were down year-over-year due to lower used vehicle pricing, primarily on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower commercial rental results and lower used vehicle pricing, partially offset by higher full service lease results. Earnings before taxes in FMS decreased 9%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 11.2%, down 160 basis points from the prior year. Used vehicle performance negatively impacted year-over-year EBT margins by 200 basis points.
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 8. We continue to see strong revenue growth in dedicated driven by upselling lease customers into driver services as well as new outsourcing activity. Total revenue grew 16% and operating revenue was up 10% due to new business as well as higher pricing and volumes.
DTS earnings increased 32% due to lower self-insurance costs and operating revenue growth. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Total revenue was up 1% as higher operating revenue was partially offset by lower third-party purchased transportation cost and lower field cost passed through to customers. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. SCS earnings before taxes were up 2%, primarily driven by new business. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.6% for the quarter, down 10 basis points from the prior year.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

Year-to-date gross capital expenditures were just over $1 billion, down $439 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet as well as greater amount of used equipment to fulfill lease contracts. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $252 million, up $40 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher sales volume, partially offset by lower used vehicle pricing. Net capital expenditures decreased by almost $500 million to $763 million. Full year 2016 gross capital expenditures are now expected to be $1.9 billion, down from $2 billion in our initial forecast. This primarily reflects a greater proportion of used equipment fulfilling lease contracts.
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $763 million year-to-date, up 16%. The increase was driven primarily by lower working capital requirements and higher cash-based earnings. We generated around $1.1 billion of total cash year-to-date, up $155 million or 17% from the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million to $1.12 billion year-to-date. The company's free cash flow was negative $62 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $425 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures, higher operating cash flow and increased sales proceeds. We are increasing our full year 2016 forecast for free cash flow to $200 million. That's up from our previous forecast of $100 million. This change primarily reflects the cash flow benefit from the redeployment of used equipment to fulfill new lease contracts.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.6 billion increased by $131 million from year-end 2015. Debt to equity at the end of the first quarter decreased to 275% from 277% at the end of the year, and is at the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%.
Despite a stronger free cash flow outlook, year-end debt to equity is forecast to be higher than initially planned due to foreign exchange rates and the pension impact to equity from lower interest rates. We now expect to end the year with a debt-to-equity ratio of 255%, 10 percentage points higher than initially planned and just above the midpoint of our target range.
Equity at the end of the quarter was just under $2.05 billion, up $60 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends.
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Page 14 summarizes key results of our asset management area. The used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 9,100 vehicles, up from 5,900 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 500 vehicles.
Current inventory levels are above our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 and reflect actions taken to reduce the size of our rental fleet. We expect second quarter to be the peak for used vehicle inventory, which should decline to around the top end of our range by year-end. We sold 5,100 used vehicles during the quarter, up by 9% from both the prior year and sequentially. Proceeds for vehicles sold were down 15% for tractors and down 4% for trucks compared to peak prices a year ago.
From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 4% and truck pricing was down 6% versus the first quarter 2016. The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 775 units year-to-date, but was similar to the levels from the prior few years. Vehicles redeployed into other applications nearly doubled to almost 2,700 units year-to-date. This reflects our actions to place excess rental vehicles into lease or dedicated contracts as we downsize the rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by around 250 units this year, reflecting higher customer bankruptcies.
I'll turn now to Page 16 to cover our outlook for 2016. During the second quarter, we continued to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in our rental and used vehicle sales by growing our contractual businesses, taking timely action to rightsize the rental fleet and managing our costs.
Revenue grew in all business segments, driven by growth in our contractual product lines. In May, we launched 2 new flexible maintenance products: ChoiceLease Preventive and ChoiceLease On-Demand, which are first for our industry. These products provide customers with new options to obtain leasing and maintenance services as we continue to find innovative ways to penetrate the large non-outsourced market.
In full service lease, we grew by 3,000 vehicles year-to-date, excluding U.K. trailers. We're increasing our full year outlook for the lease fleet growth from 3,500 vehicles to 4,000 vehicles, reflecting higher levels of redeployment activity in the first half of the year. We're also pleased that around 40% of new trucks added this year have come from customers outsourcing for the first time.
In rental, we lowered our demand outlook for the balance of the year in light of the soft conditions in the Class 8 tractor market and now expect rental demand to be down by 9% for the full year versus 7% in our previous forecast.
July demand trends to date have been slightly worse than June, and we're forecasting this to continue into the third quarter. We believe year-over-year demand comparisons will bottom out in the third quarter as we move into easier comparisons later in the year.
Despite weaker demand expectations in the third quarter, we expect less negative earnings impact due to the actions we've already taken to reduce the fleet size. We've largely completed the rental fleet reductions needed to account for a softer demand environment, but are planning an additional normal seasonal de-fleeting in the latter part of the year.
We now expect our year-end rental fleet to decline by 11% as compared to our prior expectation of down 8%. The full year average fleet should be down by 8% versus our prior forecast of 7%. We expect global rental pricing to be flat in the second half of the year.
In our asset-light maintenance products, we're pleased with continued growth in contract maintenance and market interest in our on-demand maintenance service. We're emphasizing growth in these products as a way to drive revenue and earnings with no additional capital investment required. In used vehicle sales, we expect pricing to be generally consistent with recent trends on a somewhat -- on somewhat lower sales volumes. Our outlook for Class 8 tractor pricing remains unchanged at 16% to 17% down for the full year. We believe our used vehicle inventories have peaked in the second quarter and should decline in the second half to around 8,000 vehicles.
In supply chain, we expect mid-single digit operating revenue growth with stable earnings for the balance of the year. In dedicated, operating revenue is expected to grow by high single digits for the full year, although year-over-year growth rates will be lower in the second half due to the timing of new sales. We expect solid year-over-year earnings comparisons to continue for dedicated. We're reducing our full year comparable EPS forecast to $5.90 to $6.05 from $6.10 to $6.30, primarily due to our lower outlook for rental demand and used vehicle volumes, particularly Class 8 tractors. Our third quarter comparable EPS forecast is $1.65 to $1.72 versus our prior -- versus the prior year of $1.74.

This morning, we'll recap our second quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions.

This morning, we'll recap our second quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions. With that, let's turn to an overview of our second quarter results.
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56 for the second quarter of 2016, down 5% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 comparable results exclude $0.09 of nonoperating pension costs as well as $0.09 of pension-related charges from certain benefit improvements made in 2009 that were not fully reflected in our projected benefit obligation.
Last year, comparable earnings excluded $0.05 of nonoperating pension costs, $0.02 in professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives and $0.03 in benefits from state law changes.
Despite a challenging freight environment that impacted our rental and used vehicle businesses, results were modestly above our comparable forecast range of $1.50 to $1.55, reflecting organic growth in our contractual businesses and lower overheads. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation, grew by 4% to a record $1.4 billion for the second quarter and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 5%. Total revenue increased by 2% and was impacted by lower fuel cost passed through to customers.
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the second quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased slightly to 53.4 million shares, up from 53.3 million shares last year. We began implementing our previously announced 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter, earlier than originally anticipated. The plan allows management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. During the quarter, we bought approximately 322,000 shares at an average price of $68.05. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 36.9%, largely consistent with the prior year.
Page 6 highlights financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. Operating revenue grew 6% to $2.9 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.68, down 1% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital decreased to 120 basis points, down from 140 basis points in the prior year, driven primarily by lower performance in commercial rental and used vehicle sales. For the full year 2016, we now expect this spread to be 100 basis points, at the low end of our prior forecast range of 100 to 110 basis points, reflecting lower expected commercial rental performance.
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss some key trends that we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 4%, driven mainly by growth in full service lease. Lease revenue increased 9% due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher cost of new vehicles. The lease fleet grew organically by 6,500 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from the planned reduction of U.K. trailers. Sequentially, the lease fleet increased by 1,300 units, excluding U.K. trailers, bringing our year-to-date lease fleet growth to 3,000 vehicles. We continue to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as our sales and marketing initiatives. So far this year, approximately 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Contract maintenance revenue increased 4%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 6,200 vehicles from the prior year and 1,500 sequentially reflecting new customer wins. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 11% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,600 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, a decrease of 8% from the prior year, but sequentially up 7%.
Commercial rental revenue was down 10% for the quarter. Global rental demand was lower by 9%, driven primarily by lower demand for tractors. Global pricing on power units decreased nearly 1% for the quarter. The average rental fleet decreased 7% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down by 3% or 1,400 vehicles sequentially from the first quarter and down 11% or 5,000 vehicles year-over-year as our centralized asset management team executed our plan to shrink the rental fleet in light of softer demand. We've downsized the rental fleet by both redeploying vehicles into lease contracts and taking vehicles to our used truck centers for sale.
Vehicles redeployed into other applications nearly doubled from last year. This activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow. Rental utilization on power units was 74.7%, down 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower tractor demand.
Used vehicles results were down year-over-year due to lower used vehicle pricing, primarily on tractors. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower commercial rental results and lower used vehicle pricing, partially offset by higher full service lease results. Earnings before taxes in FMS decreased 9%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 11.2%, down 160 basis points from the prior year. Used vehicle performance negatively impacted year-over-year EBT margins by 200 basis points.
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on Page 8. We continue to see strong revenue growth in dedicated driven by upselling lease customers into driver services as well as new outsourcing activity. Total revenue grew 16% and operating revenue was up 10% due to new business as well as higher pricing and volumes.
DTS earnings increased 32% due to lower self-insurance costs and operating revenue growth. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Total revenue was up 1% as higher operating revenue was partially offset by lower third-party purchased transportation cost and lower field cost passed through to customers. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. SCS earnings before taxes were up 2%, primarily driven by new business. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.6% for the quarter, down 10 basis points from the prior year.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

Year-to-date gross capital expenditures were just over $1 billion, down $439 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet as well as greater amount of used equipment to fulfill lease contracts. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $252 million, up $40 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher sales volume, partially offset by lower used vehicle pricing. Net capital expenditures decreased by almost $500 million to $763 million. Full year 2016 gross capital expenditures are now expected to be $1.9 billion, down from $2 billion in our initial forecast. This primarily reflects a greater proportion of used equipment fulfilling lease contracts.
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of $763 million year-to-date, up 16%. The increase was driven primarily by lower working capital requirements and higher cash-based earnings. We generated around $1.1 billion of total cash year-to-date, up $155 million or 17% from the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million to $1.12 billion year-to-date. The company's free cash flow was negative $62 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $425 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures, higher operating cash flow and increased sales proceeds. We are increasing our full year 2016 forecast for free cash flow to $200 million. That's up from our previous forecast of $100 million. This change primarily reflects the cash flow benefit from the redeployment of used equipment to fulfill new lease contracts.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.6 billion increased by $131 million from year-end 2015. Debt to equity at the end of the first quarter decreased to 275% from 277% at the end of the year, and is at the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%.
Despite a stronger free cash flow outlook, year-end debt to equity is forecast to be higher than initially planned due to foreign exchange rates and the pension impact to equity from lower interest rates. We now expect to end the year with a debt-to-equity ratio of 255%, 10 percentage points higher than initially planned and just above the midpoint of our target range.
Equity at the end of the quarter was just under $2.05 billion, up $60 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends.
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Page 14 summarizes key results of our asset management area. The used vehicle inventory held-for-sale was 9,100 vehicles, up from 5,900 vehicles in the prior year and up sequentially by 500 vehicles.
Current inventory levels are above our target range of 6,000 to 8,000 and reflect actions taken to reduce the size of our rental fleet. We expect second quarter to be the peak for used vehicle inventory, which should decline to around the top end of our range by year-end. We sold 5,100 used vehicles during the quarter, up by 9% from both the prior year and sequentially. Proceeds for vehicles sold were down 15% for tractors and down 4% for trucks compared to peak prices a year ago.
From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 4% and truck pricing was down 6% versus the first quarter 2016. The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 775 units year-to-date, but was similar to the levels from the prior few years. Vehicles redeployed into other applications nearly doubled to almost 2,700 units year-to-date. This reflects our actions to place excess rental vehicles into lease or dedicated contracts as we downsize the rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by around 250 units this year, reflecting higher customer bankruptcies.
I'll turn now to Page 16 to cover our outlook for 2016. During the second quarter, we continued to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in our rental and used vehicle sales by growing our contractual businesses, taking timely action to rightsize the rental fleet and managing our costs.
Revenue grew in all business segments, driven by growth in our contractual product lines. In May, we launched 2 new flexible maintenance products: ChoiceLease Preventive and ChoiceLease On-Demand, which are first for our industry. These products provide customers with new options to obtain leasing and maintenance services as we continue to find innovative ways to penetrate the large non-outsourced market.
In full service lease, we grew by 3,000 vehicles year-to-date, excluding U.K. trailers. We're increasing our full year outlook for the lease fleet growth from 3,500 vehicles to 4,000 vehicles, reflecting higher levels of redeployment activity in the first half of the year. We're also pleased that around 40% of new trucks added this year have come from customers outsourcing for the first time.
In rental, we lowered our demand outlook for the balance of the year in light of the soft conditions in the Class 8 tractor market and now expect rental demand to be down by 9% for the full year versus 7% in our previous forecast.
July demand trends to date have been slightly worse than June, and we're forecasting this to continue into the third quarter. We believe year-over-year demand comparisons will bottom out in the third quarter as we move into easier comparisons later in the year.
Despite weaker demand expectations in the third quarter, we expect less negative earnings impact due to the actions we've already taken to reduce the fleet size. We've largely completed the rental fleet reductions needed to account for a softer demand environment, but are planning an additional normal seasonal de-fleeting in the latter part of the year.
We now expect our year-end rental fleet to decline by 11% as compared to our prior expectation of down 8%. The full year average fleet should be down by 8% versus our prior forecast of 7%. We expect global rental pricing to be flat in the second half of the year.
In our asset-light maintenance products, we're pleased with continued growth in contract maintenance and market interest in our on-demand maintenance service. We're emphasizing growth in these products as a way to drive revenue and earnings with no additional capital investment required. In used vehicle sales, we expect pricing to be generally consistent with recent trends on a somewhat -- on somewhat lower sales volumes. Our outlook for Class 8 tractor pricing remains unchanged at 16% to 17% down for the full year. We believe our used vehicle inventories have peaked in the second quarter and should decline in the second half to around 8,000 vehicles.
In supply chain, we expect mid-single digit operating revenue growth with stable earnings for the balance of the year. In dedicated, operating revenue is expected to grow by high single digits for the full year, although year-over-year growth rates will be lower in the second half due to the timing of new sales. We expect solid year-over-year earnings comparisons to continue for dedicated. We're reducing our full year comparable EPS forecast to $5.90 to $6.05 from $6.10 to $6.30, primarily due to our lower outlook for rental demand and used vehicle volumes, particularly Class 8 tractors. Our third quarter comparable EPS forecast is $1.65 to $1.72 versus our prior -- versus the prior year of $1.74.

I think just something to keep in mind is if you look at this year, we're -- we have headwind from rental and used vehicle sales that equate to about 25% of our earnings. There's a lot of headwind from those 2 products just because of the level of the decline we've seen. We certainly wouldn't expect to see that going forward.

So can we continue it? All I can tell you is the interest is strong."

This morning, we'll recap our third quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions.

This morning, we'll recap our third quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions. 
With that, let's turn to an overview of our third quarter results. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were at $1.67 for the third quarter 2016, down 4% from the prior year. Third quarter 2016 comparable results exclude $0.08 of nonoperating pension cost. Last year's comparable earnings excluded $0.05 of nonoperating pension cost and $0.01 in pension-related benefits. 
Our Q3 results were within our comparable forecast range of $1.65 to $1.72, reflecting continued strength in our contractual businesses and commercial rental performance in line with our expectations for demand and pricing. In addition, favorable overhead performance helped to mitigate the impact of lower-than-expected used vehicle sales volumes. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 3% to a record $1.5 billion for the third quarter and was higher in all business segments despite rental revenue being down 14%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue increased by 4%. Total revenue increased by 3% and was impacted by the lower fuel cost passed through to customers. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the third quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was unchanged versus last year at 53.3 million shares. We began repurchasing shares under the current 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter. The plan allows for purchase of up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. 
During the quarter, we brought -- we bought approximately 58,000 shares at an average price of $64.59. For the program to date, we've purchased approximately 380,000 shares at an average price of $67.52. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 35.7% for the third quarter 2016, up 40 basis points from 35.3% in the prior year.
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. Operating revenue grew 5% to $4.3 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.35, down 3% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital decreased to 100 basis points, down from 140 basis points in the prior year, driven primarily by lower performance in used vehicle sales and commercial rental. For the full year 2016, we now expect this spread to be 90 basis points compared to our prior forecast of 100 basis points, reflecting lower expected used vehicle sales performance.
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss some key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 1% as higher contractual revenue was largely offset by lower rental revenue. Lease revenue increased 7% due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting their higher cost. The lease fleet, excluding U.K. trailers, increased by 2,200 vehicles sequentially and by 5,200 vehicles year-to-date. Included in the lease fleet are a higher number of vehicles that are being prepared for sale. 
Excluding these vehicles for more relevant comparison to our forecast, the lease fleet grew by approximately 700 vehicles sequentially and 3,700 vehicles year-to-date, which keeps us on track to achieve our full year growth forecast of 4,000 vehicles. Full service lease continues to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as our sales and marketing initiatives. So far this year, approximately 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Contract maintenance revenue increased 3%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 8,200 vehicles from the prior year, reflecting new customer wins and decreased by 100 vehicles sequentially. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 5% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 8,000 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements. This decrease of 2% from the prior year is due to lower volumes from trucking customers, but up sequentially 5%. Commercial rental revenue was down 14% for the quarter. Global rental demand was down by 13%, driven primarily by lower demand for tractors. Global pricing was flat for the quarter as expected. 
Our centralized asset management team executed effectively on our plan to reduce the rental fleet in light of softer demand by both redeploying vehicles into lease contracts and making vehicles available for sale. 
As a result of these actions, the average fleet decreased by 13% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down 2% sequentially from the second quarter and down 13% or 5,800 vehicles year-over-year. Vehicles redeployed into other applications were up significantly year-to-date. Redeployment activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow. Rental utilization on power units was up -- was 76.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. This is a significant improvement in year-over-year rental utilization comparisons versus those seen in the first half, reflecting actions that we took during the first half of the year to rightsize the rental fleet. 
Used vehicle results for the quarter were down year-over-year due to lower used vehicle pricing, primarily on tractors and lower volumes. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle sales and commercial rental results, partially offset by higher full service lease results and reduced overhead spending. Earnings before taxes in FMS decreased 11%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 11.3%, down 150 basis points from the prior year. Used vehicle sales performance negatively impacted year-over-year EBT margin percent by 230 basis points.
I'll turn now to dedicated transportation on Page 8. Total revenue grew by 15% and operating revenue was up 7% due to increased volumes, new business and higher pricing. We continue to see strong revenue growth in dedicated, driven primarily by upselling our current lease customers, which represent about 2/3 of our dedicated revenue growth. We're also seeing growth with customers that are new to outsourcing. In fact, over half of our new customers are outsourcing for the first time. DTS earnings increased 32%, primarily due to revenue growth. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.9%, up 170 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Total and operating revenue growth both grew 8% due to new business and increased volumes. SCS earnings before tax were up 16%, primarily resulting from this revenue growth. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

Year-to-date gross capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion, down $700 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet, lower expected lease fleet growth and the redeployment of used vehicles to fulfill lease contracts. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $338 million, up $17 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects 3% higher sales volumes, partially offset by 8% lower used vehicle pricing. Net capital expenditures decreased by about $700 million to $1.1 billion. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of almost $1.2 billion year-to-date, up 11%. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings and lower working capital requirements, partially offset by higher pension contributions. We generated about $1.6 billion of total cash year-to-date, up $140 million from the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by $600 million to $1.5 billion year-to-date. The company's free cash flow is positive $72 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $644 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures and higher operating cash flow. We are maintaining our full year 2016 forecast for free cash flow of positive $200 million.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.5 billion is basically flat with year-end 2015. Debt-to-equity at the end of the third quarter decreased to 263% from 277% at the end of 2015 and is within our target range of 225% to 275%.
Despite a stronger free cash flow outlook versus prior year, year-end debt-to-equity is expected to be higher than previously forecast due to the continuing pension impact to equity from lower interest rates. We now anticipate year-end debt-to-equity of 265%, up 10 percentage points higher than our most recent forecast. The table highlights the expected pension impact at year-end. We now estimate that pension will increase leverage by 64 percentage points, the largest impact in recent years. 
Equity at the end of the quarter was just under $2.1 billion, up $110 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends.
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 7,500 vehicles at quarter end. These exclude the increased number of lease vehicles being prepared for sale that I mentioned earlier. Including these vehicles for comparison purposes would increase our used vehicle inventory to approximately 9,000 units, which is up 2,900 vehicles year-over-year and down 100 vehicles sequentially. This is above our normal target of 6,000 to 8,000 used vehicles. We sold 4,000 used vehicles during the quarter, down by 9% from the prior year and down 22% sequentially. While we were able to maintain price, sales volumes were short of our target for the quarter. 
Proceeds per vehicle sold were down 13% for tractors and up 2% for trucks compared to a year ago. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was only down 1% and truck pricing was up 2%. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of 2015, overall used prices were down 11%. This was driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 16% and, to a much lesser extent, truck pricing, which was down 2%. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 730 units year-to-date, but was similar to the levels in the prior few years. 
Vehicles redeployed into other applications increased significantly to almost 4,000 units year-to-date. This reflects our actions to place excess rental vehicles into lease and dedicated contracts as we downsized our rental fleet. Early termination of lease vehicles increased by about 1,000 units this year, primarily reflecting a couple of significant customer bankruptcies. 
I'll now turn to Page 16 to cover our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. During the third quarter, we continued to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in rental and used vehicle sales while growing our contractual businesses and managing overhead costs. Our contractual products, full service lease dedicated and supply chain, all generated revenue growth of 7% or more in the quarter. Rental performance improved as a result of the fleet rightsizing work we did earlier in the year, while favorable overhead performance helped us to offset the impact of lower-than-expected used vehicle sales volumes. 
In full service lease, we grew the fleet by approximately 3,700 vehicles year-to-date after adjusting for an increased number of vehicles being prepared for sale, as mentioned earlier. As such, we're on track to achieve our full year lease fleet growth forecast of 4,000 vehicles. We're also pleased that around 40% of our new lease vehicles added this year have come from customers outsourcing for the first time. 
In rental, utilization comparisons improved significantly versus those realized in the first half of the year. This reflects the actions that we took in the first half to rightsize the rental fleet and the fact that demand was in line with our expectations for the third quarter. Rental pricing was stable and generally in line with our expectation. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect rental demand to be down 9% for the full year. In light of this, we continue to expect our rental fleet to decline by 11% year-over-year at year-end and by 8% on average. Since we've rightsized the fleet for the current environment, we anticipate that utilization will remain within our long-term targeted range and that global rental pricing will remain generally flat in the fourth quarter. 
In used vehicle sales, the overall environment continues to be very challenging. Pricing has been in line with our expectations, but volumes have been lower than anticipated. Going forward, we'll continue to balance price and volume in order to maximize sales proceeds at the same time, managing inventory levels to be near our target range. 
In supply chain, we continue to expect mid-single-digit operating revenue growth with generally stable margins in the fourth quarter. 
In dedicated, operating revenue is expected to grow by high single digits for the full year, although we expect a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter due to the timing of new sales. We also expect favorable year-over-year margin comparisons to continue in dedicated. 
Given these factors, we're reducing our full year comparable earnings per share forecast to $5.70 to $5.85 from $5.90 to $6.05, primarily to reflect our reduced outlook for used vehicle sales results. Given the shortfall in used vehicle sales volumes in the third quarter, we're expanding the range of our fourth quarter estimate to account for some additional wholesaling activity, which may be necessary to maintain inventories near our target range. The fourth quarter comparable earnings per share forecast is $1.35 to $1.50 versus the prior year of $1.66.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. At this time, I'll turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

We're looking to be up a little bit from what we sold in the third quarter in terms of total volumes, maybe a couple hundred of units. If you look at the high end of the range that we gave you, we're looking to be up slightly in terms of volume. In terms of how to look at it for the fourth quarter, if you look at the net gains for used vehicle sales in the third quarter, we're probably looking at a couple million dollars in the quarter. So we're looking to be somewhere around that to flattish in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, in the high end of the scenario. So the range that we've given you is depending on how much volume we could move in the fourth quarter. And if we see an opportunity to move more volume, we're going to look to wholesale some more units possibly, and that'll get us down to the lower end of the range. In that case, we would be moving more units than the 4,300."

Used vehicle sales should be less headwind, but again, it'll still be a headwind next year unless the market turns. And I think right now, most people are seeing this used truck market is going to be around for a little bit, a little bit longer certainly. The positives, we're going to have growth. I'm still expecting growth across all the contractual businesses. The growth is probably going to be less than what we had this year, primarily in FSL and FMS, primarily the headwind on less OEM production that's being forecasted now. And in dedicated and supply chains, a little bit of the timing of new sales. But I still expect positive contributions from each of those. We are -- we are not going to have the same depreciation benefit that we had this year. We're not going to have -- we don't expect to have a depreciation benefit at all. So that was $40 million of tailwind that we had this year that we shouldn't have next year. So that's kind of how it's all coming together as we start to look at it. But again, there's still a lot of work to be done around overhead cost actions that we're going to look at and take and some of the other things around new products and things that could also help us. So the cake is not baked yet. And obviously, our goal is always to try to get -- make us much of the headwind up as we can. But there are still going to be some meaningful headwind going into 2017."

This morning, we'll recap our third quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions. 
  
With that, let's turn to an overview of our third quarter results. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.67 for the third quarter 2016, down 4% from the prior year. Third quarter 2016 comparable results exclude $0.08 of nonoperating pension cost. Last year's comparable earnings excluded $0.05 of nonoperating pension cost and $0.01 in pension-related benefits. 
Our Q3 results were within our comparable forecast range of $1.65 to $1.72, reflecting continued strength in our contractual businesses and commercial rental performance in line with our expectations for demand and pricing. In addition, favorable overhead performance helped to mitigate the impact of lower-than-expected used vehicle sales volumes. Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 3% to a record $1.5 billion for the third quarter and was higher in all business segments despite rental revenue being down 14%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue increased by 4%. Total revenue increased by 3% and was impacted by the lower fuel cost passed through to customers. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the third quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was unchanged versus last year at 53.3 million shares. We began repurchasing shares under the current 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter. The plan allows for purchase of up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. 
During the quarter, we brought -- we bought approximately 58,000 shares at an average price of $64.59. For the program to date, we've purchased approximately 380,000 shares at an average price of $67.52. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 35.7% for the third quarter 2016, up 40 basis points from 35.3% in the prior year.
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. Operating revenue grew 5% to $4.3 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.35, down 3% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital decreased to 100 basis points, down from 140 basis points in the prior year, driven primarily by lower performance in used vehicle sales and commercial rental. For the full year 2016, we now expect this spread to be 90 basis points compared to our prior forecast of 100 basis points, reflecting lower expected used vehicle sales performance.
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss some key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 1% as higher contractual revenue was largely offset by lower rental revenue. Lease revenue increased 7% due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting their higher cost. The lease fleet, excluding U.K. trailers, increased by 2,200 vehicles sequentially and by 5,200 vehicles year-to-date. Included in the lease fleet are a higher number of vehicles that are being prepared for sale. 
Excluding these vehicles for more relevant comparison to our forecast, the lease fleet grew by approximately 700 vehicles sequentially and 3,700 vehicles year-to-date, which keeps us on track to achieve our full year growth forecast of 4,000 vehicles. Full service lease continues to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as our sales and marketing initiatives. So far this year, approximately 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Contract maintenance revenue increased 3%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 8,200 vehicles from the prior year, reflecting new customer wins and decreased by 100 vehicles sequentially. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 5% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 8,000 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements. This decrease of 2% from the prior year is due to lower volumes from trucking customers, but up sequentially 5%. Commercial rental revenue was down 14% for the quarter. Global rental demand was down by 13%, driven primarily by lower demand for tractors. Global pricing was flat for the quarter as expected. 
Our centralized asset management team executed effectively on our plan to reduce the rental fleet in light of softer demand by both redeploying vehicles into lease contracts and making vehicles available for sale. 
As a result of these actions, the average fleet decreased by 13% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down 2% sequentially from the second quarter and down 13% or 5,800 vehicles year-over-year. Vehicles redeployed into other applications were up significantly year-to-date. Redeployment activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow. Rental utilization on power units was up -- was 76.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. This is a significant improvement in year-over-year rental utilization comparisons versus those seen in the first half, reflecting actions that we took during the first half of the year to rightsize the rental fleet. 
Used vehicle results for the quarter were down year-over-year due to lower used vehicle pricing, primarily on tractors and lower volumes. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle sales and commercial rental results, partially offset by higher full service lease results and reduced overhead spending. Earnings before taxes in FMS decreased 11%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 11.3%, down 150 basis points from the prior year. Used vehicle sales performance negatively impacted year-over-year EBT margin percent by 230 basis points.
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation on Page 8. Total revenue grew by 15%, and operating revenue was up 7% due to increased volumes, new business and higher pricing. We continue to see strong revenue growth in Dedicated, driven primarily by upselling our current lease customers, which represent about 2/3 of our Dedicated revenue growth. We're also seeing growth with customers that are new to outsourcing. In fact, over half of our new customers are outsourcing for the first time. DTS earnings increased 32%, primarily due to revenue growth. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.9%, up 170 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Total and operating revenue growth both grew 8% due to new business and increased volumes. SCS earnings before tax were up 16%, primarily resulting from this revenue growth. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

Year-to-date gross capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion, down $700 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet, lower expected lease fleet growth and",372,"Thanks, Robert. Turning to Page 10. Year-to-date gross capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion, down $700 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet, lower expected lease fleet growth and the redeployment of used vehicles to fulfill lease contracts. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $338 million, up $17 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects 3% higher sales volumes, partially offset by 8% lower used vehicle pricing. Net capital expenditures decreased by about $700 million to $1.1 billion. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of almost $1.2 billion year-to-date, up 11%. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings and lower working capital requirements, partially offset by higher pension contributions. We generated about $1.6 billion of total cash year-to-date, up $140 million from the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by $600 million to $1.5 billion year-to-date. The company's free cash flow was positive $72 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $644 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures and higher operating cash flow. We are maintaining our full year 2016 forecast for free cash flow of positive $200 million.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.5 billion is basically flat with year-end 2015. Debt-to-equity at the end of the third quarter decreased to 263% from 277% at the end of 2015 and is within our target range of 225% to 275%.
Despite a stronger free cash flow outlook versus prior year, year-end debt-to-equity is expected to be higher than previously forecast due to the continuing pension impact to equity from lower interest rates. We now anticipate year-end debt-to-equity of 265%, up 10 percentage points higher than our most recent forecast. The table highlights the expected pension impact at year end. We now estimate that pension will increase leverage by 64 percentage points, the largest impact in recent years. 
Equity at the end of the quarter was just under $2.1 billion, up $110 million from year end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends.
 
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 7,500 vehicles at quarter end. These exclude the increased number of lease vehicles being prepared for sale that I mentioned earlier. Including these vehicles for comparison purposes would increase our used vehicle inventory to approximately 9,000 units, which is up 2,900 vehicles year-over-year and down 100 vehicles sequentially. This is above our normal target of 6,000 to 8,000 used vehicles. We sold 4,000 used vehicles during the quarter, down by 9% from the prior year and down 22% sequentially. While we were able to maintain price, sales volumes were short of our target for the quarter. 
Proceeds for vehicles sold were down 13% for tractors and up 2% for trucks compared to a year ago. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was only down 1% and truck pricing was up 2%. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of 2015, overall used prices were down 11%. This was driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 16% and, to a much lesser extent, truck pricing, which was down 2%. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 730 units year-to-date, but was similar to the levels in the prior few years. 
Vehicles redeployed into other applications increased significantly to almost 4,000 units year-to-date. This reflects our actions to place excess rental vehicles into lease and dedicated contracts as we downsized our rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by about 1,000 units this year, primarily reflecting a couple of significant customer bankruptcies. 
I'll now turn to Page 16 to cover our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. During the third quarter, we continued to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in rental and used vehicle sales while growing our contractual businesses and managing overhead costs. Our contractual products, full service lease, dedicated and supply chain, all generated revenue growth of 7% or more in the quarter. Rental performance improved as a result of the fleet rightsizing work we did earlier in the year, while favorable overhead performance helped us to offset the impact of lower-than-expected used vehicle sales volumes. 
In full service lease, we grew the fleet by approximately 3,700 vehicles year-to-date after adjusting for an increased number of vehicles being prepared for sale, as mentioned earlier. As such, we're on track to achieve our full year lease fleet growth forecast of 4,000 vehicles. We're also pleased that around 40% of our new lease vehicles added this year have come from customers outsourcing for the first time. 
In rental, utilization comparisons improved significantly versus those realized in the first half of the year. This reflects the actions that we took in the first half to rightsize the rental fleet and the fact that demand was in line with our expectations for the third quarter. Rental pricing was stable and generally in line with our expectation. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect rental demand to be down 9% for the full year. In light of this, we continue to expect our rental fleet to decline by 11% year-over-year at year end and by 8% on average. Since we've rightsized the fleet for the current environment, we anticipate that utilization will remain within our long-term targeted range and that global rental pricing will remain generally flat in the fourth quarter. 
In used vehicle sales, the overall environment continues to be very challenging. Pricing has been in line with our expectations, but volumes had been lower than anticipated. Going forward, we'll continue to balance price and volume in order to maximize sales proceeds at the same time, managing inventory levels to be near our target range. 
In Supply Chain, we continue to expect mid-single-digit operating revenue growth with generally stable margins in the fourth quarter. 
In Dedicated, operating revenue is expected to grow by high single digits for the full year, although we expect a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter due to the timing of new sales. We also expect favorable year-over-year margin comparisons to continue in Dedicated. 
Given these factors, we're reducing our full year comparable earnings per share forecast to $5.70 to $5.85 from $5.90 to $6.05, primarily to reflect our reduced outlook for used vehicle sales results. Given the shortfall in used vehicle sales volumes in the third quarter, we're expanding the range of our fourth quarter estimate to account for some additional wholesaling activity, which may be necessary to maintain inventories near our target range. The fourth quarter comparable earnings per share forecast is $1.35 to $1.50 versus the prior year of $1.66.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. At this time, I'll turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

I'm still expecting growth across all the contractual businesses. The growth is probably going to be less than what we had this year, primarily in FSL and FMS, primarily the headwind on less OEM production that's being forecasted now. And in Dedicated and Supply Chain, a little bit of the timing of new sales, but I still expect positive contributions from each of those. We are not going to have the same depreciation benefit that we had this year. We're not going to have -- we don't expect to have a depreciation benefit at all. So that was $40 million of tailwind that we had this year that we shouldn't have next year. So that's kind of how it's all coming together as we start to look at it.

So the cake is not baked yet. And obviously, our goal is always to try to get -- make as much of the headwind up as we can, but there's still going to be some meaningful headwind going into 2017."

That is a lever that we may pull going into 2017 and do more extensions in order to keep units from coming to the -- more units from coming to the UTC. So there could be some marginal increase in that going into next year. And then early terminations, as I mentioned, was really primarily a couple of bankruptcies that we had, customer bankruptcies or credit pulls that we had to take vehicles back.

Now we've rightsized the fleet. So basically, the pull-through -- the negative pull-through has been minimized. It's going to be at that lease to rental margin percentage, somewhere in the 30-plus percent level where you're going to get negative pull-through on the lost revenue.

This morning, we'll recap our third quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions. 
  
With that, let's turn to an overview of our third quarter results. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.67 for the third quarter 2016, down 4% from the prior year. Third quarter 2016 comparable results exclude $0.08 of nonoperating pension cost. Last year's comparable earnings excluded $0.05 of nonoperating pension cost and $0.01 in pension-related benefits. 
Our Q3 results were within our comparable forecast range of $1.65 to $1.72, reflecting continued strength in our contractual businesses and commercial rental performance in line with our expectations for demand and pricing. In addition, favorable overhead performance helped to mitigate the impact of lower-than-expected used vehicle sales volumes. 
Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 3% to a record $1.5 billion for the third quarter and was higher in all business segments despite rental revenue being down 14%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue increased by 4%. Total revenue increased by 3% and was impacted by the lower fuel cost passed through to customers. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the third quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was unchanged versus last year at 53.3 million shares. We began repurchasing shares under the current 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter. The plan allows for purchase of up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. 
During the quarter, we brought -- we bought approximately 58,000 shares at an average price of $64.59. For the program to date, we've purchased approximately 380,000 shares at an average price of $67.52. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 35.7% for the third quarter 2016, up 40 basis points from 35.3% in the prior year.
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. Operating revenue grew 5% to $4.3 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.35, down 3% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital decreased to 100 basis points, down from 140 basis points in the prior year, driven primarily by lower performance in used vehicle sales and commercial rental. For the full year 2016, we now expect this spread to be 90 basis points compared to our prior forecast of 100 basis points, reflecting lower expected used vehicle sales performance.
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss some key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 1% as higher contractual revenue was largely offset by lower rental revenue. Lease revenue increased 7% due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting their higher cost. The lease fleet, excluding U.K. trailers, increased by 2,200 vehicles sequentially and by 5,200 vehicles year-to-date. Included in the lease fleet are a higher number of vehicles that are being prepared for sale. 
Excluding these vehicles for more relevant comparison to our forecast, the lease fleet grew by approximately 700 vehicles sequentially and 3,700 vehicles year-to-date, which keeps us on track to achieve our full year growth forecast of 4,000 vehicles. Full service lease continues to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as our sales and marketing initiatives. So far this year, approximately 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Contract maintenance revenue increased 3%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 8,200 vehicles from the prior year, reflecting new customer wins and decreased by 100 vehicles sequentially. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 5% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 8,000 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements. This decrease of 2% from the prior year is due to lower volumes from trucking customers, but up sequentially 5%. Commercial rental revenue was down 14% for the quarter. Global rental demand was down by 13%, driven primarily by lower demand for tractors. Global pricing was flat for the quarter as expected. 
Our centralized asset management team executed effectively on our plan to reduce the rental fleet in light of softer demand by both redeploying vehicles into lease contracts and making vehicles available for sale. 
As a result of these actions, the average fleet decreased by 13% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down 2% sequentially from the second quarter and down 13% or 5,800 vehicles year-over-year. Vehicles redeployed into other applications were up significantly year-to-date. Redeployment activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow. Rental utilization on power units was up -- was 76.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. This is a significant improvement in year-over-year rental utilization comparisons versus those seen in the first half, reflecting actions that we took during the first half of the year to rightsize the rental fleet. 
Used vehicle results for the quarter were down year-over-year due to lower used vehicle pricing, primarily on tractors and lower volumes. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle sales and commercial rental results, partially offset by higher full service lease results and reduced overhead spending. Earnings before taxes in FMS decreased 11%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 11.3%, down 150 basis points from the prior year. Used vehicle sales performance negatively impacted year-over-year EBT margin percent by 230 basis points.
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation on Page 8. Total revenue grew by 15%, and operating revenue was up 7% due to increased volumes, new business and higher pricing. We continue to see strong revenue growth in Dedicated, driven primarily by upselling our current lease customers, which represent about 2/3 of our Dedicated revenue growth. We're also seeing growth with customers that are new to outsourcing. In fact, over half of our new customers are outsourcing for the first time. DTS earnings increased 32%, primarily due to revenue growth. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.9%, up 170 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Total and operating revenue growth both grew 8% due to new business and increased volumes. SCS earnings before tax were up 16%, primarily resulting from this revenue growth. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

Year-to-date gross capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion, down $700 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet, lower expected lease fleet growth and the redeployment of used vehicles to fulfill lease contracts. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $338 million, up $17 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects 3% higher sales volumes, partially offset by 8% lower used vehicle pricing. Net capital expenditures decreased by about $700 million to $1.1 billion. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of almost $1.2 billion year-to-date, up 11%. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings and lower working capital requirements, partially offset by higher pension contributions. We generated about $1.6 billion of total cash year-to-date, up $140 million from the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by $600 million to $1.5 billion year-to-date. The company's free cash flow was positive $72 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $644 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures and higher operating cash flow. We are maintaining our full year 2016 forecast for free cash flow of positive $200 million.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.5 billion is basically flat with year-end 2015. Debt-to-equity at the end of the third quarter decreased to 263% from 277% at the end of 2015 and is within our target range of 225% to 275%.
Despite a stronger free cash flow outlook versus prior year, year-end debt-to-equity is expected to be higher than previously forecast due to the continuing pension impact to equity from lower interest rates. We now anticipate year-end debt-to-equity of 265%, up 10 percentage points higher than our most recent forecast. The table highlights the expected pension impact at year end. We now estimate that pension will increase leverage by 64 percentage points, the largest impact in recent years. 
Equity at the end of the quarter was just under $2.1 billion, up $110 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends.
 
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 7,500 vehicles at quarter end. These exclude the increased number of lease vehicles being prepared for sale that I mentioned earlier. Including these vehicles for comparison purposes would increase our used vehicle inventory to approximately 9,000 units, which is up 2,900 vehicles year-over-year and down 100 vehicles sequentially. This is above our normal target of 6,000 to 8,000 used vehicles. We sold 4,000 used vehicles during the quarter, down by 9% from the prior year and down 22% sequentially. While we were able to maintain price, sales volumes were short of our target for the quarter. 
Proceeds per vehicles sold were down 13% for tractors and up 2% for trucks compared to a year ago. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was only down 1% and truck pricing was up 2%. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of 2015, overall used prices were down 11%. This was driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 16%, and to a much lesser extent, truck pricing, which was down 2%. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 730 units year-to-date, but was similar to the levels in the prior few years. 
Vehicles redeployed into other applications increased significantly to almost 4,000 units year-to-date. This reflects our actions to place excess rental vehicles into lease and dedicated contracts as we downsized our rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by about 1,000 units this year, primarily reflecting a couple of significant customer bankruptcies. 
I'll now turn to Page 16 to cover our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. During the third quarter, we continued to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in rental and used vehicle sales while growing our contractual businesses and managing overhead costs. Our contractual products, full service lease, dedicated and supply chain, all generated revenue growth of 7% or more in the quarter. Rental performance improved as a result of the fleet rightsizing work we did earlier in the year, while favorable overhead performance helped us to offset the impact of lower-than-expected used vehicle sales volumes. 
In full service lease, we grew the fleet by approximately 3,700 vehicles year-to-date after adjusting for an increased number of vehicles being prepared for sale, as mentioned earlier. As such, we're on track to achieve our full year lease fleet growth forecast of 4,000 vehicles. We're also pleased that around 40% of our new lease vehicles added this year have come from customers outsourcing for the first time. 
In rental, utilization comparisons improved significantly versus those realized in the first half of the year. This reflects the actions that we took in the first half to rightsize the rental fleet and the fact that demand was in line with our expectations for the third quarter. Rental pricing was stable and generally in line with our expectation. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect rental demand to be down 9% for the full year. In light of this, we continue to expect our rental fleet to decline by 11% year-over-year at year end and by 8% on average. Since we've rightsized the fleet for the current environment, we anticipate that utilization will remain within our long-term targeted range and that global rental pricing will remain generally flat in the fourth quarter. 
In used vehicle sales, the overall environment continues to be very challenging. Pricing has been in line with our expectations, but volumes have been lower than anticipated. Going forward, we'll continue to balance price and volume in order to maximize sales proceeds, at the same time managing inventory levels to be near our target range. 
In Supply Chain, we continue to expect mid-single-digit operating revenue growth with generally stable margins in the fourth quarter. 
In Dedicated, operating revenue is expected to grow by high-single digits for the full year, although we expect a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter due to the timing of new sales. We also expect favorable year-over-year margin comparisons to continue in Dedicated. 
Given these factors, we're reducing our full year comparable earnings per share forecast to $5.70 to $5.85 from $5.90 to $6.05, primarily to reflect our reduced outlook for used vehicle sales results. Given the shortfall in used vehicle sales volumes in the third quarter, we're expanding the range of our fourth quarter estimate to account for some additional wholesaling activity, which may be necessary to maintain inventories near our target range. The fourth quarter comparable earnings per share forecast is $1.35 to $1.50 versus the prior year of $1.66.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. At this time, I'll turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

In terms of how to look at it for the fourth quarter, if you look at the net gains for used vehicle sales in the third quarter, we're probably looking at a couple million dollars in the quarter. So we're looking to be somewhere around that to flattish in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, on the high end of the scenario. See, the range that we've given you is depending on how much volume we could move in the fourth quarter. And if we see an opportunity to move more volume, we're going to look to wholesale some more units possibly, and that'll get us down to the lower end of the range.

It really depends on how the market here evolves over the next quarter, next several quarters and also some decisions we've got to make here in the fourth quarter of what we want to do with the vehicles that we have in inventory, and are we going to look to maybe wholesale some additional units to get the inventories down a little bit.

I expect rental to be a headwind in the first half and then get a little bit -- get better in the second half because of the rightsizing of the fleet. Used vehicle sales should be less headwind. But again, there'll still be a headwind next year unless the market turns. And I think right now, most people are seeing this used truck market is going to be around for a little bit, a little bit longer certainly. The positives, we're going to have growth. I'm still expecting growth across all the contractual businesses. The growth is probably going to be less than what we had this year, primarily in FSL and FMS, primarily the headwind on less OEM production that's being forecasted now. And in Dedicated and Supply Chain, a little bit of the timing of new sales, but I still expect positive contributions from each of those. We are not going to have the same depreciation benefit that we had this year. We're not going to have -- we don't expect to have a depreciation benefit at all. So that was $40 million of tailwind that we had this year that we shouldn't have next year. So that's kind of how it's all coming together as we start to look at it. But again, there's still a lot of work to be done around overhead cost actions that we're going to look at and take and some of the other things around new products and things that could also help us. So the cake is not baked yet. And obviously, our goal is always to try to get -- make as much of the headwind up as we can, but there's still going to be some meaningful headwind going into 2017."

So there could be some marginal increase in that going into next year. And then early terminations, as I mentioned, was really primarily a couple of bankruptcies that we had, customer bankruptcies or credit pulls that we had to take vehicles back.

So what we're trying to do is make sure we don't get too far above where we're at right now. We want to stay within striking distance of that 8,000, and that's really the game plan as we go into Q4.

This morning, we'll recap our third quarter 2016 results, review the asset management area and discuss the current outlook for our business. Then we'll open the call for questions. 
  
With that, let's turn to an overview of our third quarter results. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.67 for the third quarter 2016, down 4% from the prior year. Third quarter 2016 comparable results exclude $0.08 of nonoperating pension cost. Last year's comparable earnings excluded $0.05 of nonoperating pension cost and $0.01 in pension-related benefits. 
Our Q3 results were within our comparable forecast range of $1.65 to $1.72, reflecting continued strength in our contractual businesses and commercial rental performance in line with our expectations for demand and pricing. In addition, favorable overhead performance helped to mitigate the impact of lower-than-expected used vehicle sales volumes. 
Operating revenue, which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue, grew by 3% to a record $1.5 billion for the third quarter and was higher in all business segments despite rental revenue being down 14%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue increased by 4%. Total revenue increased by 3% and was impacted by the lower fuel cost passed through to customers. 
Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the third quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was unchanged versus last year at 53.3 million shares. We began repurchasing shares under the current 2 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program in the second quarter. The plan allows for purchase of up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the former plan that were not repurchased prior to expiration. 
During the quarter, we brought -- we bought approximately 58,000 shares at an average price of $64.59. For the program to date, we've purchased approximately 380,000 shares at an average price of $67.52. Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 35.7% for the third quarter 2016, up 40 basis points from 35.3% in the prior year.
Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a year-to-date basis. Operating revenue grew 5% to $4.3 billion. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.35, down 3% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital decreased to 100 basis points, down from 140 basis points in the prior year, driven primarily by lower performance in used vehicle sales and commercial rental. For the full year 2016, we now expect this spread to be 90 basis points compared to our prior forecast of 100 basis points, reflecting lower expected used vehicle sales performance.
I'll turn now to Page 7 and discuss some key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter. Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 1% as higher contractual revenue was largely offset by lower rental revenue. Lease revenue increased 7% due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting their higher cost. The lease fleet, excluding U.K. trailers, increased by 2,200 vehicles sequentially and by 5,200 vehicles year-to-date. Included in the lease fleet are a higher number of vehicles that are being prepared for sale. 
Excluding these vehicles for more relevant comparison to our forecast, the lease fleet grew by approximately 700 vehicles sequentially and 3,700 vehicles year-to-date, which keeps us on track to achieve our full year growth forecast of 4,000 vehicles. Full service lease continues to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as our sales and marketing initiatives. So far this year, approximately 40% of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing, up from about 1/3 last year.
Contract maintenance revenue increased 3%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by 8,200 vehicles from the prior year, reflecting new customer wins and decreased by 100 vehicles sequentially. Contract-related maintenance revenue was up 5% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 8,000 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements. This decrease of 2% from the prior year is due to lower volumes from trucking customers, but up sequentially 5%. Commercial rental revenue was down 14% for the quarter. Global rental demand was down by 13%, driven primarily by lower demand for tractors. Global pricing was flat for the quarter as expected. 
Our centralized asset management team executed effectively on our plan to reduce the rental fleet in light of softer demand by both redeploying vehicles into lease contracts and making vehicles available for sale. 
As a result of these actions, the average fleet decreased by 13% year-over-year. The ending rental fleet was down 2% sequentially from the second quarter and down 13% or 5,800 vehicles year-over-year. Vehicles redeployed into other applications were up significantly year-to-date. Redeployment activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts, which benefited cash flow. Rental utilization on power units was up -- was 76.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. This is a significant improvement in year-over-year rental utilization comparisons versus those seen in the first half, reflecting actions that we took during the first half of the year to rightsize the rental fleet. 
Used vehicle results for the quarter were down year-over-year due to lower used vehicle pricing, primarily on tractors and lower volumes. I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. 
Overall, FMS earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle sales and commercial rental results, partially offset by higher full service lease results and reduced overhead spending. Earnings before taxes in FMS decreased 11%. FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 11.3%, down 150 basis points from the prior year. Used vehicle sales performance negatively impacted year-over-year EBT margin percent by 230 basis points.
I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation on Page 8. Total revenue grew by 15%, and operating revenue was up 7% due to increased volumes, new business and higher pricing. We continue to see strong revenue growth in Dedicated, driven primarily by upselling our current lease customers, which represent about 2/3 of our Dedicated revenue growth. We're also seeing growth with customers that are new to outsourcing. In fact, over half of our new customers are outsourcing for the first time. DTS earnings increased 32%, primarily due to revenue growth. Segment earnings before taxes as a percent of operating revenue were 8.9%, up 170 basis points from the prior year.
I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on Page 9. Total and operating revenue growth both grew 8% due to new business and increased volumes. SCS earnings before tax were up 16%, primarily resulting from this revenue growth. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital spending."

Year-to-date gross capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion, down $700 million from the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in our rental fleet, lower expected lease fleet growth and the redeployment of used vehicles to fulfill lease contracts. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $338 million, up $17 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects 3% higher sales volumes, partially offset by 8% lower used vehicle pricing. Net capital expenditures decreased by about $700 million to $1.1 billion. 
Turning to the next page. We generated cash from operating activities of almost $1.2 billion year-to-date, up 11%. The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings and lower working capital requirements, partially offset by higher pension contributions. We generated about $1.6 billion of total cash year-to-date, up $140 million from the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by $600 million to $1.5 billion year-to-date. The company's free cash flow was positive $72 million year-to-date versus the prior year of negative $644 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures and higher operating cash flow. We are maintaining our full year 2016 forecast for free cash flow of positive $200 million.
Page 12 addresses our debt-to-equity position. Total debt of $5.5 billion is basically flat with year-end 2015. Debt-to-equity at the end of the third quarter decreased to 263% from 277% at the end of 2015 and is within our target range of 225% to 275%.
Despite a stronger free cash flow outlook versus prior year, year-end debt-to-equity is expected to be higher than previously forecast due to the continuing pension impact to equity from lower interest rates. We now anticipate year-end debt-to-equity of 265%, up 10 percentage points higher than our most recent forecast. The table highlights the expected pension impact at year end. We now estimate that pension will increase leverage by 64 percentage points, the largest impact in recent years. 
Equity at the end of the quarter was just under $2.1 billion, up $110 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends.
 
At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update."

Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 7,500 vehicles at quarter end. These exclude the increased number of lease vehicles being prepared for sale that I mentioned earlier. Including these vehicles for comparison purposes would increase our used vehicle inventory to approximately 9,000 units, which is up 2,900 vehicles year-over-year and down 100 vehicles sequentially. This is above our normal target of 6,000 to 8,000 used vehicles. We sold 4,000 used vehicles during the quarter, down by 9% from the prior year and down 22% sequentially. While we were able to maintain price, sales volumes were short of our target for the quarter. 
Proceeds per vehicles sold were down 13% for tractors and up 2% for trucks compared to a year ago. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was only down 1% and truck pricing was up 2%. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of 2015, overall used prices were down 11%. This was driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 16%, and to a much lesser extent, truck pricing, which was down 2%. 
The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term increased versus last year by around 730 units year-to-date, but was similar to the levels in the prior few years. 
Vehicles redeployed into other applications increased significantly to almost 4,000 units year-to-date. This reflects our actions to place excess rental vehicles into lease and dedicated contracts as we downsized our rental fleet. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by about 1,000 units this year, primarily reflecting a couple of significant customer bankruptcies. 
I'll now turn to Page 16 to cover our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. During the third quarter, we continued to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in rental and used vehicle sales while growing our contractual businesses and managing overhead costs. Our contractual products, full service lease, dedicated and supply chain, all generated revenue growth of 7% or more in the quarter. Rental performance improved as a result of the fleet rightsizing work we did earlier in the year, while favorable overhead performance helped us to offset the impact of lower-than-expected used vehicle sales volumes. 
In full service lease, we grew the fleet by approximately 3,700 vehicles year-to-date after adjusting for an increased number of vehicles being prepared for sale, as mentioned earlier. As such, we're on track to achieve our full year lease fleet growth forecast of 4,000 vehicles. We're also pleased that around 40% of our new lease vehicles added this year have come from customers outsourcing for the first time. 
In rental, utilization comparisons improved significantly versus those realized in the first half of the year. This reflects the actions that we took in the first half to rightsize the rental fleet and the fact that demand was in line with our expectations for the third quarter. Rental pricing was stable and generally in line with our expectation. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect rental demand to be down 9% for the full year. In light of this, we continue to expect our rental fleet to decline by 11% year-over-year at year end and by 8% on average. Since we've rightsized the fleet for the current environment, we anticipate that utilization will remain within our long-term targeted range and that global rental pricing will remain generally flat in the fourth quarter. 
In used vehicle sales, the overall environment continues to be very challenging. Pricing has been in line with our expectations, but volumes have been lower than anticipated. Going forward, we'll continue to balance price and volume in order to maximize sales proceeds, at the same time managing inventory levels to be near our target range. 
In Supply Chain, we continue to expect mid-single-digit operating revenue growth with generally stable margins in the fourth quarter. 
In Dedicated, operating revenue is expected to grow by high-single digits for the full year, although we expect a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter due to the timing of new sales. We also expect favorable year-over-year margin comparisons to continue in Dedicated. 
Given these factors, we're reducing our full year comparable earnings per share forecast to $5.70 to $5.85 from $5.90 to $6.05, primarily to reflect our reduced outlook for used vehicle sales results. Given the shortfall in used vehicle sales volumes in the third quarter, we're expanding the range of our fourth quarter estimate to account for some additional wholesaling activity, which may be necessary to maintain inventories near our target range. The fourth quarter comparable earnings per share forecast is $1.35 to $1.50 versus the prior year of $1.66.

We're looking to be up a little bit from what we sold in the third quarter in terms of total volumes, maybe a couple hundred of units. If you look at the high end of the range that we gave you, we're looking to be up slightly in terms of volume. In terms of how to look at it for the fourth quarter, if you look at the net gains for used vehicle sales in the third quarter, we're probably looking at a couple million dollars in the quarter. So we're looking to be somewhere around that to flattish in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, on the high end of the scenario. See, the range that we've given you is depending on how much volume we could move in the fourth quarter. And if we see an opportunity to move more volume, we're going to look to wholesale some more units possibly, and that'll get us down to the lower end of the range. In that case, we would be moving more units than the 4,300."

So what I can tell you is that I would expect next year's headwind is going to be meaningfully less. But is it going to be breakeven or is it going to be somewhat negative? We still don't know. It really depends on how the market here evolves over the next quarter, next several quarters and also some decisions we've got to make here in the fourth quarter of what we want to do with the vehicles that we have in inventory, and are we going to look to maybe wholesale some additional units to get the inventories down a little bit.

I expect rental to be a headwind in the first half and then get a little bit -- get better in the second half because of the rightsizing of the fleet. Used vehicle sales should be less headwind. But again, there'll still be a headwind next year unless the market turns. And I think right now, most people are seeing this used truck market is going to be around for a little bit, a little bit longer certainly. The positives, we're going to have growth. I'm still expecting growth across all the contractual businesses. The growth is probably going to be less than what we had this year, primarily in FSL and FMS, primarily the headwind on less OEM production that's being forecasted now. And in Dedicated and Supply Chain, a little bit of the timing of new sales, but I still expect positive contributions from each of those. We are not going to have the same depreciation benefit that we had this year. We're not going to have -- we don't expect to have a depreciation benefit at all. So that was $40 million of tailwind that we had this year that we shouldn't have next year. So that's kind of how it's all coming together as we start to look at it. But again, there's still a lot of work to be done around overhead cost actions that we're going to look at and take and some of the other things around new products and things that could also help us. So the cake is not baked yet. And obviously, our goal is always to try to get -- make as much of the headwind up as we can, but there's still going to be some meaningful headwind going into 2017."

That is a lever that we may pull going into 2017 and do more extensions in order to keep units from coming to the -- more units from coming to the UTC. So there could be some marginal increase in that going into next year. And then early terminations, as I mentioned, was really primarily a couple of bankruptcies that we had, customer bankruptcies or credit pulls that we had to take vehicles back.

That's helpful. And then I also wanted to ask about rental utilization. If you look at the sequential trend, we saw an improvement, and that's different than what we've seen in the past few years where rental utilization has declined sequentially in the third quarter. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about the trend in utilization going forward? And also how this could impact margins given rental tends to be a higher-margin business?"

So I think as you look at the margin impact of a dropping demand, we probably saw the worst of it in Q2, where really we still had too many units in the fleet during the middle of that quarter and we had lost the revenue. Now we've rightsized the fleet. So basically, the pull-through -- the negative pull-through has been minimized. It's going to be at that lease to rental margin percentage, somewhere in the 30-plus percent level where you're going to get negative pull-through on the lost revenue. That should catch the tail sometime in the middle of next year. We start to see then some year-over-year improvements."
