First off, our results for the first quarter of 2016 were outstanding. Our net sales grew 14% while our adjusted earnings per share grew 25%. On an adjusted basis, we achieved quarterly records for operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share. In fact, this was as our 11th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth. We believe this results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us extend our leadership position in North America. These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient, lighting and building automation solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity. Our adjusted profitability for the quarter was a record for Acuity even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth and in areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio, as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solutions. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on a few highlights for the quarter. 
Net sales for the first quarter were $737 million, the first quarter record representing an increase of 14% compared with the year-ago period and the second highest quarterly sales in our history. Recorded operating profit for the first quarter of 2016 was $112.4 million compared with the reported operating profit of $86.7 million in the year-ago period. We recorded special pretax charges of $400,000 this quarter and $10 million in the year-ago quarter associated with certain streamlining actions to lower our cost structure in certain areas so we can accelerate investment in new opportunities with greater potential for profitable growth. Also, our reported operating profit included expenses associated with the acquisition of Juno and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including among others, increase amortization expense for intangibles associated with the acquisition of Distech controls, which was completed on September 1 of this quarter. I find it helpful to adjust both quarters' results by adding back these items to make them comparable. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $117.1 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $96.7 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin for this quarter was a record 15.9%, up 100 basis points from adjusted margin in the year ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a quarterly record of $1.65 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.32 in the year ago period, up 25%. Strong quarterly results indeed. 
In addition, we generated a robust $51 million in net cash provided by operating activities this quarter. We closed the quarter with $560 million with cash on hand after investing $239 million for the acquisition of Distech Controls and $23 million for capital expenditures. As you know, we completed the acquisition of the Juno Lighting Group on December 10 for approximately $380 million leaving us with plenty of financial power to execute our strategy. Our results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. 
While net sales for the first quarter grew 14% compared with a year-ago period, we estimate our sales value grew by the same 14%. The addition of Distech added 3 points of growth which was offset by 2 points of currency fluctuation primarily for the weakening Canadian dollar and 1 point for changes in price mix. While it's not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe the difference was primary due to lower pricing and like kind LED luminaires between period reflecting the decline in certain LED component cost and to a lesser degree in changes in the mix of product sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products grew by 41% this quarter compared with the year ago period, an extraordinary achievement when 1 considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for more than half of our total sales which, as you know, also includes non-fixture related products as well. We believe our rate of growth for LED luminaires continues to far outpace the growth of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market-leading prowess. 
Lastly, we believe our channel product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces, have allowed us to again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter. 
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted first quarter operating profit was $117 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit for the quarter was a record 15.9%, up 100 basis points from the adjusted margin on the year-ago period. Our gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 43.4%, up 120 basis points compared with a year-ago quarter. The expansion of our gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales, somewhat offset by price mix and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Productivity improvements and lower material costs also had a favorable improvement on our gross profit margins this quarter. 
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter, were up $26.6 million or 15%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.5% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expenses primarily due to higher freight commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of Distech and to a lesser degree, higher compensation cost. The increase in compensation cost is primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our first quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin for adjusted profit margin on the increase in net sales, excluding the acquired performance of Distech. Our variable contribution margin was 24% consistent with our expectations. 
All in all, we had another great quarter. 
From the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, pending the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. From a product and lighting solutions development perspective, we continue our rapid pace of new introductions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and Lighting Controls solutions. As we have noted in the past, we offer customers more than 1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. 
Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT applications. The addition of June and its very talented associates will meaningfully enhance our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. We continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tier levels. The purchase of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs whether it be a single device, which we identify as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated building automation and lighting solution, which we refer to as Tier 3 for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a huge competitive advantage for Acuity. While sales information for our tiered solutions are still precise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were again up more than 40% this quarter over the year-ago period. Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to provide data collection and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional revenue streams which we identify us Tier 4. To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure, to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including the acquisitions of Distech Controls, the Juno Lighting Group, and Geometri, as well as increasing our salary headcount to support the growth in our tiered solutions strategy. Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best -- how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve. At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Today, we have converted over 10 million square feet of space for customers, utilizing over 150,000 beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with actionable information. We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. The addition of Geometri will only add to this industry-leading solution from Acuity. 
At Acuity Brands, we continue to build and our legacy of excellence, innovation and profitable growth. We are focused on rapidly developing new technologies and aggressively expanding our industry-leading portfolio with intelligent solutions that represent significant advancements over traditional technologies and easily network with other systems, creating lightning and building automation solutions that deliver superior quality, energy efficiency and performance, including a robust enabler for the Internet of Things. 
As I have noted before, our organization is a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during eras of technology disruption and that is even more true today. As part of our tiered solution strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. We are very pleased that Distech Controls and its very talented team officially joined the Acuity family on September 1. Distech Controls, as well as our other strategic partnerships, will help drive our tiered solution strategy, particularly as it relates to our holistic approach towards the advancement of smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect the combination of Acuity with our broad industry-leading, solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solution strategy of offering true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building, including enhanced occupant experience, quality visual environment, seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions, as well as an increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data to better enable the Internet of Things for building owners. We expect strategic opportunities such as these, coupled with our internal efforts, to allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further service a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on a new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. 
With the addition of Juno, we will be now almost 9,000 associates strong. I will talk more about Juno and our future growth strategies or expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2016 and beyond. Ricky?"

Vern covered the primary drivers for our first quarter sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items. I will provide a bit more color on our record first quarter results and our financial position, as well as our acquisitions of Distech Controls, Juno Lighting Group and Geometri.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be more comparable. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we added back various items that are a consequence of applying purchase accounting to the Distech results. This acquisition-related adjustments include pretax $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS for the acquired profit and inventory. Pretax $1.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted EPS for acquisition-related professional fees associated with the Distech and the Juno acquisitions. Pretax $2.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the amortization of the acquired intangible assets of Distech and $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS for the stock-based expense related to initial restricted stock unit grants to certain key employees of Distech. 
In addition to the acquisition-related items, we also adjusted our GAAP results for the special charge in the first quarter of 2016, a $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS. We also adjusted the prior year results for the special charge of $10 million or $0.15 per diluted EPS. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.65 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 25% increase compared with $1.32 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. These adjusted results should provide a proper comparison to our expected results. 
As a consequence to the recent acquisitions of Distech, Juno and Geometri, along with our intent to make additional strategic acquisitions, we will have a fair bit of noise in our GAAP numbers in the future, primarily due to U.S. GAAP purchase accounting requirements and the expected increase in stock-based compensation, largely as a result of our strategy to further align the interest of the senior leadership of acquired businesses, as well as our associates with our shareholders as we drive and enhance our entrepreneurial culture. 
Therefore, beginning this quarter, we intend to -- as further adjust our GAAP financial results for each quarter and full year by adding back the full impact of these items to our results in order for them to be comparable between periods and we encourage you to adjust your financial models for Acuity to reflect these adjustments. We typically adjust for these items in our internal reviews of the performance and use these non-GAAP measures for baseline comparative operational analysis, decision-making, and other activities. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhance visibility into our results of operation. You -- we think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. 
In addition, many of our peer companies make these same adjustments so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. 
In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provided a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. We also provided in the Form 8-K filed today the quarterly historical amounts for acquisition-related amortization and stock-based compensation so you can revise previous periods GAAP results to reflect these adjustments, which you can then compare with the adjusted results we will use going forward. 
Since Vern's previous discussion and analysis was primarily on the adjusted results, excluding the add-back of all the amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation, I will provide a few key performance items for the first quarter of 2016 with these additional adjustments. These as further adjusted results will provide a baseline as we continue reporting this information in the future.
As further adjusted, operating profit for the first quarter of 2016, including these additional adjustments, was $125.9 million, compared with $103.7 million in the prior year. As further adjusted operating margin was 17.1% in this quarter, an increase of 110 basis points compared with the prior year. As further adjusted diluted EPS with these additional items added back for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.77. The comparable prior year amount was $1.43, which is an increase of 24%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 35% compared with 34 -- 5.9% [ph] in the first quarter of last year. The prior-year effective tax rate was impacted by an unfavorable discrete items which did not recur in the current year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates and our tax jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year. 
Cash flow generated from operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 plus $51.1 million, an increase of $4.4 million compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job of managing our operating working capital defined as receivables, plus inventory, less payables. This quarter as our operating working capital days decreased by 4 days compared with last year to 32 days, which we believe is industry-leading. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we spent $23.1 million on capital expenditures compared with $18.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics capacity and the build out of our innovation and technology center in Metro Atlanta which we moved into last month. We currently expect to spend an approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016. 
At November 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalent balance of $560.2 million, a decrease of $196.6 million since August 31. We spent almost $240 million on acquisitions in the first quarter. Our total debt was $352.4 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. 
At November 30, 2015, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million under our credit facility which does not expire until August 2019. So even though we have spent over $618 million net of cash acquired in the last 4 months on acquisitions, we clearly still have significant financial strength and flexibility and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
I will conclude with some additional comments on the Distech Controls, Juno Lighting Group and Geometri acquisitions. On September 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Distech Controls for approximately $300 million -- CAD $318 million net of cash acquired, or approximately USD 240 million, which we use cash on hand. Distech Controls generated net sales in excess of CAD 80 million during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, and enjoyed a 5-year annual growth rate of over 25%. The operating profit margin of Distech Controls is similar to Acuity, excluding U.S. GAAP required purchase accounting adjustments. We expect Distech Controls will be modestly accretive to our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial results. The Juno Lighting Group acquisition closed on December 10, 2015 subsequent to quarter end. We acquired all of the equity interest in Juno using cash on hand for approximately $380 million. Juno was a leading provider of down lighting and track lighting feature for both residential and commercial applications. Their annual sales was approximately $250 million for the last 12 months with EBITDA margins in the low teens. We are very excited to add Juno to our portfolio and expect them to be accretive to our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial results. The Geometri acquisition closed on December 9, 2015 subsequent to the quarter end. Geometri is a provider of software and a service platform for mapping navigation and analytics. While financially, this acquisition is currently immaterial to our results, it is a very important strategically as it adds advanced indoor mapping, navigation and analytics capability to our indoor positioning technology solutions. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern"
1413208,318917513,916579,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 08, 2016",2016-01-08,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for us. Our growth expectations for the North American lighting industry, primari",1032,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for us. Our growth expectations for the North American lighting industry, primarily North America, has not really changed much over the last several quarters in spite of the noise to the contrary. We remain very positive. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate our observations for fiscal 2016. 
First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest but increasing pace. While forecasts for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is expected to grow mid- to upper single-digit range for our fiscal 2016, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the continued favorable trend in our December order rate seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American markets such as architecture building index, vacancy rates, office absorption and lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost over the next 12 months. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increase -- increases in associated headcount, wage inflation and a negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign exchange rate fluctuations which are impossible to predict. Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume, price, product, and sales channel mix, and innovation, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which would also benefit our mix and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies. Our record gross profit margin in the first quarter was a good example of our potential, but we prefer to look at our margin improvement over a 12-month period to remove quarterly anomalies like last year's second quarter due to weather or the seasonality of the second quarter in general to discern proper trends. You should do the same. It is a positive picture. 
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation. 
Lastly, and most importantly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by our many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of Tier 3 and Tier 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that, for example, connects smart lighting with smartphones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. As we have noted in our last several calls, while our strategies drive profitable growth remain essentially the same, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and had much greater opportunities to offer customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities. 
Further, as you know, we completed the acquisitions of the Juno Lighting Group and Geometri in December. We expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. As we noted in our press release, Juno had revenues of approximately $250 million in the trailing 12 months. We are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group. However, we do anticipate some modest short-term impact on their revenue growth rate as we integrate certain overlapping sales forces. This is a common phenomenon in our industry when acquisitions occur due to the nature of the specification construction cycle for commercial projects. 
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our growing business analytics capabilities as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering. 
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. 
Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our growth -- our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry, as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront, along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by more than 50% over the next 3 years, will provide us with significant growth potential. 
As the North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting and growing industries. Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have."

That amount's approximately correct again today with the 8-K we filed will give you a 3-year trend of by quarter of what those amounts are so you can get the trend in this recent quarter. Now we will have a little bit more restricted stock that we'll be issuing with these new acquisitions, that would increase that a little bit. The reason we went to this is a variety of reasons. One, as we've indicated, we've made 3 acquisitions in the last 4 months, 2 of which are fairly sizable. The purchase accounting required by U.S. GAAP increases noncash amortization pretty significantly around trade names, around customers, around technology and so forth that can really distort the historical and underlying performance of the business, we believe, if someone's really looking at how the business is performing versus these noncash items that you have to allocate the purchase price to that increased the amortization. And we're acquisitive and think we'll continue to do this. And then on the stock compensation, similarly, we issue stock many times to the key executives when we acquire our business to get their interest align with ours since they're our employees you have to expect that you can't put that as part of the purchase price. And so that's cost and increase. And so as we've become more entrepreneurial and technology-focused internally, we're using that as a mechanism to incentivize and align employees' interests with shareholders. Lastly, I'd say when we look at most of our public peer companies, they were making those same type of adjustments. And so we figured as we're comparing our results as to now what Phillips will spend out of their lighting business or OSRAM or go on down the list, they were adding back these items so we thought it would be helpful to have us have an adjusted on a comparable basis to what many of the other people in our industry are doing."

But then there are other areas which tend to bring that down a little bit. So listen, we are responding to the marketplace in a very aggressive way. And we believe that our growth rates continue to outpace of the overall growth rates in the market. You are absolutely correct.

The areas where they have strengths, we actually have a need. And so when you think about our broad down lighting capability, they only enhance it. If you think about our track capability, we do track. But what they do with track is really -- it adds a better best capability to our good capability. So we view, from a product solution perspective, a perfect combination. There is very little in the way of present or an overlap. When it comes so our presence in channels, they are very strong on the residential channel. This gives us really an opportunity to be the market leader in that channel now. When you look at how they handled corporate accounts, they bring a unique capability. In fact, when we look at the customer base, there's very, very little overlap. So both of us are now going to be able to take the other ones product solutions portfolio to the customers that we call on. So it's really a very opportunistic situation. And then when you look at the commercial markets, the ability to now have these portfolios be available through superior selling forces, we think gives us a real opportunity. The Juno acquisition, yes, there will be certainly cost synergies. Purchasing, for example, may be some duplicate warehousing, whatever. But this is really about growth synergies. The opportunity for both Juno and Acuity to attack the markets together will give us great strength. Markets where neither one of us really participated as well as we could. I look at the residential market where we both have the strength, but now together, it really gives us an opportunity do participate in what I believe will be a decade-plus long growth in overall residential construction. It's interesting to me that when we look at residential construction on an inflation-adjusted basis, though U.S. residential construction market is still up 50% from its peak in 2006. So when you think about population growth over the last decade of probably 2% plus per annum, there is a whole lot of inventory that needs to be built to handle these changing trends. And so we are just very bullish around the whole opportunity of what Juno will bring. And you'll start to see those benefits manifest themselves over the next 12 to 18 months."

On the surprise side, you always see ebbing and flowing in certain geographies and things of that nature. There is some dislocation that's going on that's caused by the changes in oil price. But for the most part, Acuity is extremely diversified. Our renovation capabilities are pretty robust so we continue to see opportunities both in new construction and renovation. And it's that diversification that has given us the ability to, if you will, ride out small little geographical nuances or issues and overall, deliver growth that is really quite robust. The lighting market and the nonresidential construction market for awards and construction put in place, as I mentioned earlier, do have a lag. So to the extent that we actually see this uptick as was described earlier I think the person from Goldman Sachs, that's just additional opportunity for Acuity to continue to outperform the growth rates in the markets we serve.

But I would say that renovation continues to be a huge opportunity. Based on some of the data that we've seen, this may be a little bit old now, but if you look at outdoor lighting, the market is only 10% converted. If you look at indoor lighting, it's only 3% converted. So we see the renovation opportunity to continue to be very interesting to us given our access to market, our ability to create products that fit the needs of these markets. And as those prices come down in fixtures and solutions sets, the ability to sell those products in the markets where they have lower energy costs, now you can get the payback. So you'll -- we just believe that, that conversion over the next decade is going to be a robust opportunity, particularly for us. And so then when you add new construction on top of that, it's just -- it's like getting 2 scoops of ice cream. What were our mixed [indiscernible]? I don't have a good crystal ball around that.

To say overall, this is the direction of pricing and how does it compare 1 to the other, it just depends absolutely on the project. It depends on the vertical, it depends on the size of the capability, it depends on what someone's trying to do. If a big box retailer is converting a store from conventional lighting technology to digital lighting, it's a -- the fixtures are primarily the same. They're very ubiquitous. So pricing is very, very aggressive. If someone is converting their law office and it's a very high add from conventional, usually they're choosing luminaires and solution sets that are very sophisticated, do many things and are generally more expensive. The margin dynamics for Acuity are very exciting for both because the cost structure just happens to be different, the cost of service very different. So if you look at the expansion of our margins, I believe that's because of 2 things: one, we're growing our top line in areas that are very important both new construction and as well as renovation. But we continue to drive great deal of of productivity cost out with the types of engineering capabilities and we're bringing new solution sets that add value. So I think you'll continue to see us improve our margins. And from a pricing perspective, it's really about how we bring value-add pricing in the marketplace has been consistent and how it approaches it for a long time. So we don't see any meaningful changes in how the market competes, if you will."

And so the notion of material cost and how we engineere products to cost out things and how we improve our productivity, FX to a degree, the mix change, I would say that the market it -- has been fairly benign in a cost basis. We've seen some significant improvements in some areas only to see increases in cost, not necessarily commodity or material-based costs or component costs in other areas. So I think you'll continue to see us improve our margin. But mix obviously, has a big influence on that. Sales volume has a big influence. We're not expecting any significant changes in material cost. We do think that health care costs will continue to rise. So we're always looking for ways to use our internal ABS process, our ability to improve productivity as ways to help offset some of those things. Because again, as you all know, we operate in a big business kind of environment. So I would say that as you think about margins going forward, it really is more about our ability to drive volume, our ability to continue to drive productivity than it would be on any 1 given commodity costs component."

The primary sales that they sell through is the system integrator. The system integrator, you're absolutely right they are very good at both new construction as well as renovation.

Bringing these things together so that they are extremely smart and extremely simple to use and simple to install, we believe is a powerful, powerful value proposition for customers. So the ability to begin targeting specification for whether it's new construction or renovation together, we think is a huge opportunity. And just to tell you where we are on this, I mean, if you use the baseball analogy, the managers are walking up the home plate to exchange their line of cards. So we are just now getting after this. But the enthusiasm in certain markets between both agents and system integrators is really very, very interesting.

So if you start to think about Acuity bringing in that holistic total building solution and you now add on top of that the ability to drive and collect business analytics. Because again, we believe that between Distech and Acuity's lighting control systems, that combination, we can collect north of 85% of all the data that's being created in a building.

That had expired a year plus ago and they reinstated that and then reinstating and making permanent the R&D tax credit, which is now as we're continuing to do more and more in the technology space is a positive plus for us.

The competitive dynamics were again, consistent with what we've seen. We didn't -- there's nothing that, I would say, that would be noteworthy in terms of the pricing dynamics that would be outside the norm, if you will.",514,"So I answered the last part first. The competitive dynamics were again, consistent with what we've seen. We didn't -- there's nothing that, I would say, that would be noteworthy in terms of the pricing dynamics that would be outside the norm, if you will. That doesn't mean that we don't experience -- big business that we don't experience some competitive pressures. So I wouldn't call that out. The variable contribution, folks, what you have to understand is that we are making investments in our business. We've done this for a long time. And it depends on the timing of some of these things. So this quarter, we -- the hiring that we did, we've added some tremendous capability that will drive revenues. And so those revenues will flow through without us having to add additional capabilities to garner those. And so you'll see this ebbing and flowing in our variable contribution margin. That's why we said mid- to upper single -- mid to upper 20s as a -- as sort of a target. But ultimately, as the investment that we make and the investment base becomes pretty solid, we expect that the growth rates on our top line will meaningfully impact those variable contributions because we have the core competencies in place and we're now driving great revenues over that, if you will, new fixed base. Having said that, I think over the course of the year, you'll continue to see very favorable variable contribution margins. This quarter was smacked that consistent to what we expected. And the things that are happening that represent huge growth opportunities, we're starting to see the benefits of those. We're starting to see the revenues rolling through. Our Tier 3 solutions, which again are off a very small bays, the growth rate there is robust. And our margins, while we're trying to make sure we understand them, their contributory, they're accretive to what we're doing overall. And again, just a final comment, the reason Ricky is now trying to give you a base to understand what our real margins are is because we do expect to continue to be acquisitive in driving our business. And the purchase accounting adjustments that we have to make off of the businesses that we've acquired. So for example, just take Distech. Their margins were very consistent with ours. But once you do purchase accounting, all of a sudden, those margins changed rather dramatically. Well, the way we look at the business and the way you look at the business is without some of those, if you will, U.S. GAAP purchase adjustments for these noncash items. The cash was already spent and so through the purchase price. So we're trying to give everyone a real apples-to-apples picture. And it's positive. I mean, when you compare our 17-plus percent adjusted -- further adjusted OP percentage number to our competitors on that same basis, it's a wow. And that's why we want to make sure that you -- all of you be these kinds of things because it's a -- really a positive picture."

First off, our results for the first quarter of 2016 were outstanding. Our net sales grew 14% while our adjusted earnings per share grew 25%. On an adjusted basis, we achieved quarterly records for operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share. In fact, this was as our 11th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America. These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient, lighting and building automation solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity. 
Our adjusted profitability for the quarter was a record for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth and in areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solutions. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter. 
Net sales for the first quarter were $737 million, first quarter record representing an increase of 14% compared with the year-ago period and the second highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the first quarter of 2016 was $112.4 million compared with reported operating profit of $86.7 million in the year-ago period. We recorded special pretax charges of $400,000 this quarter and $10 million in the year-ago quarter associated with certain streamlining actions to lower our cost structure in certain areas, so we can accelerate investment in new opportunities with greater potential for profitable growth. Also, our reported operating profit included expenses associated with the acquisition of Juno and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including among others, increased amortization expense for intangibles associated with the acquisition of Distech controls, which was completed on September 1 of this quarter. I find it helpful to adjust both quarter's results by adding back these items to make them comparable. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $117.1 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $96.7 million in the year-ago period. 
Adjusted operating profit margin for this quarter was a record 15.9%, up 100 basis points from adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a quarterly record of $1.65 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.32 in the year-ago period, up 25%. Strong quarterly results indeed. 
In addition, we generated a robust $51 million in net cash provided by operating activities this quarter. We closed the quarter with $560 million with cash on hand after investing $239 million for the acquisition of Distech Controls and $23 million for capital expenditures. As you know, we completed the acquisition of the Juno Lighting Group on December 10 for approximately $380 million, leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our strategy. Our results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. 
While net sales for the first quarter grew 14% compared with the year-ago period, we estimate our sales volume grew by the same 14%. The addition of Distech added 3 points of growth, which was offset by 2 points of foreign currency fluctuation, primarily for the weakening Canadian dollar and 1 point for changes in price mix. While it's not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing and like-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs, and to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products grew by 41% this quarter compared with the year-ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for more than half of our total sales, which, as you know, also includes nonfixture-related products as well. We believe our rate of growth for LED luminaires continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market-leading prowess. 
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter. 
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted first quarter operating profit was $117 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit for the quarter was a record 15.9%, up 100 basis points from the adjusted margin on the year-ago period. Our gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 43.4%, up 120 basis points compared with a year-ago quarter. The expansion of our gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales, somewhat offset by price mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Productivity improvements and lower material costs also had a favorable impact on our gross profit margin this quarter. 
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter, were up $26.6 million or 15%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.5% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of Distech and to a lesser degree, higher compensation cost. The increase in compensation cost was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our first quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin or adjusted operating profit on the increase in net sales excluding the acquired performance of Distech. Our variable contribution margin was 24% consistent with our expectations. All in all, we had another great quarter. 
From the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, pending the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. 
From a product and lighting solutions development perspective, we continued our rapid pace of new introductions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and Lighting Controls solutions. As we have noted in the past, we offer customers more than 1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. 
Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT applications. The addition of Juno and its very talented associates will meaningfully enhance our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. We continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tier levels. The purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device, which we identify as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated building automation and lighting solution, which we refer to as Tier 3 for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a huge competitive advantage for Acuity. While sales information for our tiered solutions is still in precise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were again up more than 40% this quarter over the year-ago period. Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to provide data collection and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional revenue streams which we identify us Tier 4. To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including the acquisitions of Distech Controls, the Juno Lighting Group, and Geometri as well as increasing our salaried headcount to support the growth in our tiered solutions strategy. 
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best -- how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve. At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Today, we have converted over 10 million square feet of space for customers, utilizing over 150,000 beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with actionable information. We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. The addition of Geometri will only add to this industry-leading solution from Acuity. 
At Acuity Brands, we continue to build on our legacy of excellence, innovation and profitable growth. We are focused on rapidly developing new technologies and aggressively expanding our industry-leading portfolio with intelligent solutions that represent significant advancements over traditional technologies and easily network with other systems, creating lightning and building automation solutions that deliver superior quality, energy efficiency and performance, including a robust enabler for the Internet of Things. 
As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during eras of technology disruption and that is even more true today. As part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. We are very pleased that Distech Controls and its very talented team officially joined the Acuity family on September 1. Distech Controls as well as our other strategic partnerships will help drive our tiered solution strategy, particularly as it relates to our holistic approach towards the advancement of smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect the combination of Acuity with our broad industry-leading, solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy to offering true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building, including enhanced occupant experience, quality visual environment, seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as an increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data to better enable the Internet of Things for building owners. We expect strategic opportunities such as these, coupled with our internal efforts, to allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further service a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. 
With the addition of Juno, we will now be almost 9,000 associates strong. I will talk more about Juno and our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2016 and beyond. Ricky?"

Vern covered the primary drivers for our first quarter sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items. I will provide a bit more color on our record first quarter results and our financial position as well as our acquisitions of Distech Controls, Juno Lighting Group and Geometri.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be more comparable. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we added back various items that are a consequence of applying purchase accounting to the Distech results. These acquisition-related adjustments include pretax $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS for the acquired profit and inventory, pretax $1.1 million or $0.02 per diluted EPS for acquisition-related professional fees associated with the Distech and the Juno acquisitions, pretax $2.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the amortization of the acquired intangible assets of Distech and $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS for the stock-based expense related to initial restricted stock unit grants to certain key employees of Distech. 
In addition to the acquisition-related items, we also adjusted our GAAP results for the special charge in the first quarter of 2016, $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS. We also adjusted the prior year results for the special charge of $10 million or $0.15 per diluted EPS. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.65 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 25% increase compared with $1.32 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. These adjusted results should provide a proper comparison to our expected results. 
As a consequence of the recent acquisitions of Distech, Juno and Geometri, along with our intent to make additional strategic acquisitions, we will have a fair bit of noise in our GAAP numbers in the future, primarily due to U.S. GAAP purchase accounting requirements and the expected increase in stock-based compensation, largely as a result of our strategy to further align the interest of the senior leadership of acquired businesses as well as our associates with our shareholders as we drive and enhance our entrepreneurial culture. 
Therefore, beginning this quarter, we intend to further adjust our GAAP financial results for each quarter and full year by adding back the full impact of these items to our results in order for them to be comparable between periods and we encourage you to adjust your financial models for Acuity to reflect these adjustments. We typically adjust for these items in our internal reviews of the performance and use these non-GAAP measures for baseline comparative operational analysis, decision-making and other activities. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operation. You -- we think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. 
In addition, many of our peer companies make these same adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. 
In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provided a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. We also provided in the Form 8-K filed today, the quarterly historical amounts for acquisition-related amortization and stock-based compensation, so you can revise previous periods GAAP results to reflect these adjustments, which you can then compare with the adjusted results we will use going forward. 
Since Vern's previous discussion and analysis was primarily on the adjusted results, excluding the add-back of all the amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation, I will provide a few key performance items for the first quarter of 2016 with these additional adjustments. These as further adjusted results will provide a baseline as we continue reporting this information in the future.
As further adjusted, operating profit for the first quarter of 2016, including these additional adjustments, was $125.9 million compared with $103.7 million in the prior year. As further adjusted operating profit margin was 17.1% in this quarter, an increase of 110 basis points compared with the prior year. As further adjusted diluted EPS with these additional items added back for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $1.77, the comparable prior year amount was $1.43, which is an increase of 24%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 35% compared with 34 -- 5.9% in the first quarter of last year. The prior year effective tax rate was impacted by unfavorable discrete items which did not recur in the current year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year. 
Cash flow generated from operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $51.1 million, an increase of $4.4 million compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job of managing our operating working capital, defined as receivable, plus inventory, less payables, this quarter as our operating working capital days decreased by 4 days compared with last year to 32 days, which we believe is industry-leading. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we spent $23.1 million on capital expenditures compared with $18.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics capacity and the build out of our innovation and technology center in Metro Atlanta, which we moved into last month. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016. 
At November 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalent balance of $560.2 million, a decrease of $196.6 million since August 31. We spent almost $240 million on acquisitions in the first quarter. Our total debt was $352.4 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. 
At November 30, 2015, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. So even though we have spent over $618 million net of cash acquired in the last 4 months on acquisitions, we clearly still have significant financial strength and flexibility and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
I will conclude with some additional comments on the Distech Controls, Juno Lighting Group and Geometri acquisitions. On September 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Distech Controls for approximately $300 million -- CAD 318 million, net of cash acquired, or approximately USD 240 million, which we use cash on hand. 
Distech Controls generated net sales in excess of CAD 80 million during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, and enjoyed a 5-year annual growth rate of over 25%. The operating profit margin of Distech Controls is similar to Acuity, excluding U.S. GAAP required purchase accounting adjustments. We expect Distech Controls will be modestly accretive to our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial results. 
The Juno Lighting Group acquisition closed on December 10, 2015, subsequent to quarter end. We acquired all of the equity interest in Juno using cash on hand for approximately $380 million. Juno was a leading provider of down lighting and track lighting fixtures for both residential and commercial applications. Their annual sales was approximately $250 million for the last 12 months, with EBITDA margins in the low teens. We are very excited to add Juno to our portfolio and expect them to be accretive to our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial results. 
The Geometri acquisition closed on December 9, 2015, subsequent to the quarter end. Geometri is a provider of software and a service platform for mapping navigation and analytics. While financially this acquisition is currently immaterial to our results, it is very important strategically as it adds advanced indoor mapping, navigation and analytics capability to our indoor positioning technology solutions. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,318917513,916615,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 08, 2016",2016-01-08,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for us. Our growth expectations for the North American lighting industry, primari",1036,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for us. Our growth expectations for the North American lighting industry, primarily North America, has not really changed much over the last several quarters in spite of the noise to the contrary. We remain very positive. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate our observations for fiscal 2016. 
First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest but increasing pace. While forecasts for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is expected to grow mid- to upper single-digit range for our fiscal 2016, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the continued favorable trend in our December order rate seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American market, such as architectural building index, vacancy rates, office absorption and lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost over the next 12 months. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increase -- increases in associated headcount, wage inflation and a negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are impossible to predict. Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume, price, product, and sales channel mix and innovation, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which would also benefit our mix and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies. Our record gross profit margin in the first quarter was a good example of our potential, but we prefer to look at our margin improvement over a 12-month period to remove quarterly anomalies like last year's second quarter due to weather or the seasonality of the second quarter in general to discern proper trends. You should do the same. It is a positive picture. 
Additionally, while we always experienced some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation. 
Lastly, and most importantly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by our many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and Tier 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that, for example, connects smart lighting with smartphones for retailers as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. 
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, while our strategies to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and had much greater opportunities to offer customers, even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities. 
Further, as you know, we completed the acquisitions of the Juno Lighting Group and Geometri in December. We expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. As we noted in our press release, Juno had revenues of approximately $250 million in the trailing 12 months. We are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group. However, we do anticipate some modest short-term impact on their revenue growth rate as we integrate certain overlapping sales forces. This is a common phenomenon in our industry when acquisitions occur due to the nature of the specification construction cycle for commercial projects. 
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our growing business analytics capabilities as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering. 
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. 
Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our growth -- our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront, along with emerging opportunities with digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. 
As the North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting and growing industries. 
Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have."

Again, today with the 8-K we filed will give you a 3-year trend of by quarter of what those amounts are, so you can get the trend in this recent quarter. Now we will have a little bit more restricted stock that we'll be issuing with these new acquisitions that would increase that a little bit. The reason we went to this is a variety of reasons. One, as we've indicated, we've made 3 acquisitions in the last 4 months, 2 of which are fairly sizable. The purchase accounting required by U.S. GAAP increases noncash amortization pretty significantly around trade names, around customers, around technology and so forth, that can really distort the historical and underlying performance of the business, we believe, if someone is really looking at how the business is performing versus these noncash items that you have to allocate the purchase price to that increased the amortization. And we're acquisitive and think we'll continue to do this. And then on the stock compensation, similarly, we issue stock many times to the key executives when we acquire a business to get their interest aligned with ours. Since they're our employees, you have to expense that. You can't put that as part of the purchase price. And so that's caused an increase. And then as we become more entrepreneurial and technology-focused internally, we're using that as a mechanism to incentivize and align employees interest with shareholders. Lastly, I'd say when we looked at most of our public peer companies, they were making those same type of adjustments. And so we figured as we are comparing our results to now what Philips will spend out as their lighting business or OSRAM or go on down the list, they were adding back these items, so we thought it would be helpful to have us have an adjusted number on a comparable basis to what many of the other people in our industry are doing."

The areas where they have strengths, we actually have a need. And so when you think about our broad down lighting capability, they only enhance it. If you think about our track capability, we do track. But what they do and track is really -- it adds a better best capability to our good capability. So we view, from a product/solution perspective, a perfect combination. There is very little in the way of duplicity or an overlap. When it comes to our presence in channels, they are very strong in the residential channel. This gives us really an opportunity to be the market leader in that channel now. When you look at how they handle corporate accounts, they bring a unique capability. In fact, when we looked at the customer base, there's very, very little overlap. So both of us are now going to be able to take the other one's product solutions portfolio to the customers that we call on. So it's really a very opportunistic situation. And then when you look at the commercial markets, the ability to now have these portfolios be available through superior selling forces we think gives us a real opportunity. The Juno acquisition, yes, there will be certainly cost synergies. Purchasing, for example, may be some duplicate warehousing, whatever. But this is really about growth synergies. The opportunity for both Juno and Acuity to attack the markets together will give us great strength. Markets where neither one of us really participated as well as we could. I look at the residential market where we both have strength, but now together, it really gives us an opportunity to participate in what I believe will be a decade-plus long growth in overall residential construction. It's interesting to me that when we look at residential construction on an inflation-adjusted basis, though U.S. residential construction market is still up almost 50% from its peak in 2006. So when you think about population growth over that last decade of probably 2% plus per annum, there is a whole lot of inventory that needs to be built to handle these changing trends. And so we are just very bullish around the whole opportunity of what Juno will bring. And you'll start to see those benefits manifest themselves over the next 12 to 18 months."

But for the most part, Acuity is extremely diversified. Our renovation capabilities are pretty robust so we continue to see opportunities both in new construction and renovation. And it's that diversification that has given us the ability to, if you will, ride out small little geographical nuances or issues and overall, deliver growth that is really quite robust. The lighting market and the nonresidential construction market for awards and construction put in place, as I mentioned earlier, do have a lag. So to the extent that we actually see this uptick as was described earlier on my -- I think the person from Goldman Sachs, that's just additional opportunity for Acuity to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve.

But I would say that renovation continues to be a huge opportunity. Based on some of the data that we've seen, this may be a little bit old now, but if you look at outdoor lighting, the market is only 10% converted. If you look at indoor lighting, it's only 3% converted. So we see the renovation opportunity to continue to be very interesting to us given our access to market, our ability to create products that fit the needs of these markets. And as those prices come down in fixtures and solutions sets, the ability to sell those products in the markets where they have lower energy costs, now you can get the payback. So you'll -- we just believe that, that conversion over the next decade is going to be a robust opportunity, particularly for us. And so then when you add new construction on top of that, it's just -- it's like getting 2 scoops of ice cream. What were our mixed feeds? I don't have a good crystal ball around that. We're marching to a $5 billion business over the next handful of years and we can see the opportunities of serving both of those markets in an aggressive way.

To say overall, this is the direction of pricing and how does it compare one to the other, it just depends absolutely on the project. It depends on the vertical, it depends on the size of the capability. It depends on what someone's trying to do. If a big box retailer is converting a store from conventional lighting technology to digital lighting, it's -- the fixtures are primarily the same. They're very ubiquitous. So pricing is very, very aggressive. If someone is converting their law office and it's a very high end for conventional, usually they're choosing luminaires and solution sets that are very sophisticated, do many things and are generally more expensive. The margin dynamics for Acuity are very exciting for both because the cost structure just happens to be different, the cost of service is different. So when you look at the expansion of our margins, I believe it's because of 2 things: one, we're growing our top line in areas that are very important, both new construction as well as renovation. But we continue to drive great deal of productivity, cost out with the types of engineering capabilities and we're bringing new solution sets that add value. So I think you'll continue to see us improve our margins. And from a pricing perspective, it's really about how we bring value-add -- pricing in the marketplace has been consistent and how it approaches it for a long time.

We've seen some significant improvements in some areas only to see increases in cost, not necessarily commodity or material-based costs or component costs in other areas.

We're not expecting any significant changes in material cost. We do think that health care costs will continue to rise.

We attributed most of that price mix to as Ricky pointed out, just change in component costs primarily for LED. We didn't see a lot of shifting going on that was different, if you will, between the channels and the verticals that we sell to. Our ability to drive an improvement in margin was again due to volume growth. But also, we are -- we're good at improving productivity within our facilities. We are good at looking to improve cost out of products that we have introduced because we have excellent engineering talent. So you're seeing Acuity at its best doing what it does best and that it's growing its top line and continuing to look at every area of its business to improve its productivity while investing. We just opened up a new facility down in Mexico because we ran out of space. So we're absorbing that. And we're driving productivity there. We are just [indiscernible] pleased, as Ricky pointed out. We moved into our new technology and innovation center indicator, where we repurposed an old factory that we had. And it's just an outstanding facility that will help us to not only retain our top talent, but to attract new talent as we continue to drive things. So this quarter, from a mix perspective and all that, I think, it was fairly consistent. There was no new news there. But what you saw is Acuity just executing well."

And then just on my follow-up, maybe sticking with sales channel but a little bit of a different question. As we look at the Distech solutions that they offer, it seems to be more on the building management. And historically, you've been very strong with that agent side of the business in the lighting. And the sales can -- if you compare sort of a building management solution and lighting solution, can come at different points in the process on the commercial build in dealing with different people. What have you seen so far in terms of the cross-pollinization of lighting products to the Distech agents and the building automation to your lighting agents?"
1413208,318917513,916615,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 08, 2016",2016-01-08,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","So it's a great question. Distech brings to us about a handful of new sales channels. The primary sales that they sell-through is the system integrator.

The primary sales that they sell-through is the system integrator. The system integrator, you're absolutely right, they are very good at both new construction as well as renovation. We see a very, very complimentary opportunity going forward to have our local agents in that local system integrator working ways to create a very strong specification for the combined capability of building automation systems of which lighting and lighting controls are a part. Bringing these things together so that they are extremely smart and extremely simple to use and simple to install, we believe is a powerful, powerful value proposition for customers. So the ability to begin targeting specification for whether it's new construction or renovation together we think is a huge opportunity. And just to tell you where we are on this, I mean, you can use a baseball analogy, the managers are walking up the home plate to exchange their line of cards. So we are just now getting after this. But the enthusiasm in certain markets between both agents and system integrators is really very, very interesting. And by the way, Geometri brings a sales channel to us that we have not participated in the past; and that's these value-added resellers. Their connectivity into large projects is quite robust. And so when you start to think about Acuity bringing in that holistic total building solution and you now add on top of that the ability to drive and collect business analytics, because again, we believe between Distech and Acuity's lighting control systems, that combination, we can collect north of 85% of all the data that's being created in a building. And now when you start to put the analytics behind it, both what we have today and we'll be at the Retail Federation show here in mid-January demonstrating again the robustness of our ByteLight, Visible Light Communication System, which is that indoor positioning; it's a robust combination. And now when you put on top of that Geometri's ability to derive analytics off of that, I'll tell you, Jed, it's a powerful combination. And we're just, obviously, starting this afresh."

The competitive dynamics were again, consistent with what we've seen. We didn't -- there's nothing that I would say would be noteworthy in terms of the pricing dynamics that would be outside the norm, if you will. That",519,"So I'll answer the last part first. The competitive dynamics were again, consistent with what we've seen. We didn't -- there's nothing that I would say would be noteworthy in terms of the pricing dynamics that would be outside the norm, if you will. That doesn't mean that we don't experience -- we are at bid [indiscernible] business that we don't experience some competitive pressures, but I wouldn't call that out. On the variable contribution, folks, what you have to understand is that we are making investments in our business. We've done this for a long time. And it depends on the timing of some of these things. So this quarter, we -- the hiring that we did, we've added some tremendous capability that will drive revenues. And so those revenues will flow through without us having to add additional capabilities to garner those. And so you'll see this ebbing and flowing in our variable contribution margin. That's why we said mid- to upper single or mid- to upper 20s as a -- sort of a target. But ultimately, as the investment that we make and the investment base becomes pretty solid, we expect that the growth rates and our top line will meaningfully impact those variable contributions because we have the core competencies in place and we're now driving great revenues over that, if you will, new fixed base. Having said that, I think over the course of the year, you'll continue to see very favorable variable contribution margins. This quarter was smacked out consistent to what we expected. And the things that are happening that represent huge growth opportunities. We're starting to see the benefits of those. We're starting to see the revenues rolling through. Our Tier 3 solutions, which again are off of very small base, the growth rate there is robust. And our margins, while we're trying to make sure we understand them, their contributory, they're accretive to what we're doing overall. And again, just a final comment, the reason Ricky is now trying to give you a base to understand what our real margins are is because we do expect to continue to be acquisitive in driving our business. And the purchase accounting adjustments that we have to make off of the businesses that we've acquired, so for example, just take Distech, their margins were very consistent with ours. But once you do purchase accounting, all of a sudden, those margins changed rather dramatically. Well, the way we look at the business and the way you look at the business is without some of those, if you will, U.S. GAAP purchase adjustments for these noncash items. The cash was already spent and so through the purchase price. So we're trying to give everyone a real apples-to-apples picture. And it's positive. I mean, when you compare our 17-plus percent adjusted -- further adjusted OP percentage number to our competitors on that same basis, it's a wow. And that's why we want to make sure that you -- all of you to be these kinds of things because it's a -- really a positive picture."

First off, our results for the first quarter of 2016 were outstanding. Our net sales grew 14% while our adjusted earnings per share grew 25%. On an adjusted basis, we achieved quarterly records for operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share. In fact, this was our 11th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America. These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient, lighting and building automation solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity. 
Our adjusted profitability for the quarter was a record for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth and in areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solutions. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter. 
Net sales for the first quarter were $737 million, a first quarter record representing an increase of 14% compared with the year-ago period and the second highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the first quarter of 2016 was $112.4 million compared with reported operating profit of $86.7 million in the year-ago period. We recorded special pretax charges of $400,000 this quarter and $10 million in the year-ago quarter associated with certain streamlining actions to lower our cost structure in certain areas, so we can accelerate investment in new opportunities with greater potential for profitable growth. Also, our reported operating profit included expenses associated with the acquisition of Juno and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including among others, increased amortization expense for intangibles associated with the acquisition of Distech Controls, which was completed on September 1 of this quarter. I find it helpful to adjust both quarter's results by adding back these items to make them comparable. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $117.1 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $96.7 million in the year-ago period. 
Adjusted operating profit margin for this quarter was a record 15.9%, up 100 basis points from adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a quarterly record of $1.65 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.32 in the year-ago period, up 25%. Strong quarterly results indeed. 
In addition, we generated a robust $51 million in net cash provided by operating activities this quarter. We closed the quarter with $560 million of cash on hand after investing $239 million for the acquisition of Distech Controls and $23 million for capital expenditures. As you know, we completed the acquisition of the Juno Lighting Group on December 10 for approximately $380 million, leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our strategy. Our results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. 
While net sales for the first quarter grew 14% compared with the year-ago period, we estimate our sales volume grew by the same 14%. The addition of Distech added 3 points of growth, which was offset by 2 points of foreign currency fluctuation, primarily for the weakening Canadian dollar, and 1 point for changes in price mix. While it's not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing and like-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs, and to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products grew by 41% this quarter compared with the year-ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for more than half of our total sales, which, as you know, also includes nonfixture-related products as well. We believe our rate of growth for LED luminaires continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market-leading prowess. 
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter. 
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted first quarter operating profit was $117 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit for the quarter was a record 15.9%, up 100 basis points from the adjusted margin on the year-ago period. Our gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 43.4%, up 120 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter. The expansion of our gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales, somewhat offset by price mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Productivity improvements and lower material costs also had a favorable impact on our gross profit margin this quarter. 
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter, were up $26.6 million or 15%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.5% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of Distech and to a lesser degree, higher compensation cost. The increase in compensation cost was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our first quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin or adjusted operating profit on the increase in net sales excluding the acquired performance of Distech. Our variable contribution margin was 24%, consistent with our expectations. All in all, we had another great quarter. 
From the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. 
From a product and lighting solutions development perspective, we continued our rapid pace of new introductions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and Lighting Controls solutions. As we have noted in the past, we offer customers more than 1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. 
Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT applications. The addition of Juno and its very talented associates will meaningfully enhance our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. We continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tier levels. The purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device, which we identify as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated building automation and lighting solution, which we refer to as Tier 3 for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a huge competitive advantage for Acuity. While sales information for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were again up more than 40% this quarter over the year-ago period. Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to provide data collection and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional revenue streams which we identify as Tier 4. To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including the acquisitions of Distech Controls, the Juno Lighting Group, and Geometri as well as increasing our salaried headcount to support the growth in our tiered solutions strategy. 
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best -- how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve. At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Today, we have converted over 10 million square feet of space for customers, utilizing over 150,000 beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with actionable information. We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. The addition of Geometri will only add to this industry-leading solution from Acuity. 
At Acuity Brands, we continue to build on our legacy of excellence, innovation and profitable growth. We are focused on rapidly developing new technologies and aggressively expanding our industry-leading portfolio with intelligent solutions that represent significant advancements over traditional technologies and easily network with other systems, creating lightning and building automation solutions that deliver superior quality, energy efficiency and performance, including a robust enabler for the Internet of Things. 
As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during eras of technology disruption and that is even more true today. As part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. We are very pleased that Distech Controls and its very talented team officially joined the Acuity family on September 1. Distech Controls as well as our other strategic partnerships will help drive our tiered solution strategy, particularly as it relates to our holistic approach towards the advancement of smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect the combination of Acuity with our broad industry-leading, solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy of offering true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building, including enhanced occupant experience, quality visual environment, seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as an increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data to better enable the Internet of Things for building owners. We expect strategic opportunities such as these, coupled with our internal efforts, to allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. 
With the addition of Juno, we will now be almost 9,000 associates strong. I will talk more about Juno and our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2016 and beyond. Ricky?"
1413208,318917513,916625,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 08, 2016",2016-01-08,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. Vern covered the primary drivers for our first quarter sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items.

Vern covered the primary drivers for our first quarter sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items. I will provide a bit more color on our record first quarter results and our financial position as well as our acquisitions of Distech Controls, Juno Lighting Group and Geometri.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be more comparable. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we added back various items that are a consequence of applying purchase accounting to the Distech results. These acquisition-related adjustments include pretax $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS for the acquired profit and inventory, pretax $1.1 million or $0.02 per diluted EPS for acquisition-related professional fees associated with the Distech and the Juno acquisitions, pretax $2.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the amortization of the acquired intangible assets of Distech and $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS for the stock-based expense related to initial restricted stock unit grants to certain key employees of Distech. 
In addition to the acquisition-related items, we also adjusted our GAAP results for the special charge in the first quarter of 2016 of $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS. We also adjusted the prior year results for the special charge of $10 million or $0.15 per diluted EPS. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.65 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 25% increase compared with $1.32 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. These adjusted results should provide a proper comparison to our expected results. 
As a consequence of the recent acquisitions of Distech, Juno and Geometri, along with our intent to make additional strategic acquisitions, we will have a fair bit of noise in our GAAP numbers in the future, primarily due to U.S. GAAP purchase accounting requirements and the expected increase in stock-based compensation, largely as a result of our strategy to further align the interest of the senior leadership of acquired businesses as well as our associates with our shareholders as we drive and enhance our entrepreneurial culture. 
Therefore, beginning this quarter, we intend to further adjust our GAAP financial results for each quarter and full year by adding back the full impact of these items to our results in order for them to be comparable between periods and we encourage you to adjust your financial models for Acuity to reflect these adjustments. We typically adjust for these items in our internal reviews of the performance and use these non-GAAP measures for baseline comparative operational analysis, decision-making and other activities. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operation. You -- we think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. 
In addition, many of our peer companies make these same adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. 
In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provided a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. We also provided in the Form 8-K filed today, the quarterly historical amounts for acquisition-related amortization and stock-based compensation, so you can revise previous periods' GAAP results to reflect these adjustments, which you can then compare with the adjusted results we will use going forward. 
Since Vern's previous discussion and analysis was primarily on the adjusted results, excluding the add-back of all the amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation, I will provide a few key performance items for the first quarter of 2016 with these additional adjustments. These as further adjusted results will provide a baseline as we continue reporting this information in the future.
As further adjusted, operating profit for the first quarter of 2016, including these additional adjustments, was $125.9 million compared with $103.7 million in the prior year. As further adjusted operating profit margin was 17.1% in this quarter, an increase of 110 basis points compared with the prior year. As further adjusted diluted EPS with these additional items added back for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $1.77, the comparable prior year amount was $1.43, which is an increase of 24%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 35% compared with 34 -- 5.9% in the first quarter of last year. The prior year effective tax rate was impacted by unfavorable discrete items which did not recur in the current year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year. 
Cash flow generated from operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $51.1 million, an increase of $4.4 million compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job of managing our operating working capital, defined as receivables, plus inventory, less payables, this quarter as our operating working capital days decreased by 4 days compared with last year to 32 days, which we believe is industry-leading. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we spent $23.1 million on capital expenditures compared with $18.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics capacity and the buildout of our innovation and technology center in Metro Atlanta, which we moved into last month. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016. 
At November 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalent balance of $560.2 million, a decrease of $196.6 million since August 31. We spent almost $240 million on acquisitions in the first quarter. Our total debt was $352.4 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. 
At November 30, 2015, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. So even though we have spent over $618 million net of cash acquired in the last 4 months on acquisitions, we clearly still have significant financial strength and flexibility and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
I will conclude with some additional comments on the Distech Controls, Juno Lighting Group and Geometri acquisitions. On September 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Distech Controls for approximately $300 million -- CAD 318 million, net of cash acquired, or approximately USD 240 million, which we use cash on hand. 
Distech Controls generated net sales in excess of CAD 80 million during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, and enjoyed a 5-year annual growth rate of over 25%. The operating profit margin of Distech Controls is similar to Acuity, excluding U.S. GAAP required purchase accounting adjustments. We expect Distech Controls will be modestly accretive to our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial results. 
The Juno Lighting Group acquisition closed on December 10, 2015, subsequent to quarter end. We acquired all of the equity interest in Juno using cash on hand for approximately $380 million. Juno was a leading provider of down lighting and track lighting fixtures for both residential and commercial applications. Their annual sales was approximately $250 million for the last 12 months, with EBITDA margins in the low teens. We are very excited to add Juno to our portfolio and expect them to be accretive to our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial results. 
The Geometri acquisition closed on December 9, 2015, subsequent to the quarter end. Geometri is a provider of software and a service platform for mapping navigation and analytics. While financially this acquisition is currently immaterial to our results, it is very important strategically as it adds advanced indoor mapping, navigation and analytics capability to our indoor positioning technology solutions. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,318917513,916625,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 08, 2016",2016-01-08,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for us. Our growth expectations for the North American lighting industry, primari",1036,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for us. Our growth expectations for the North American lighting industry, primarily North American, has not really changed much over the last several quarters in spite of the noise to the contrary. We remain very positive. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate our observations for fiscal 2016. 
First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest but increasing pace. While forecasts for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is expected to grow mid- to upper single-digit range for our fiscal 2016, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the continued favorable trend in our December order rate seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American market, such as architectural building index, vacancy rates, office absorption and lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost over the next 12 months. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increase -- increases in associated headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are impossible to predict. Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume, price, product, and sales channel mix and innovation, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which would also benefit our mix and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies. Our record gross profit margin in the first quarter was a good example of our potential, but we prefer to look at our margin improvement over a 12-month period to remove quarterly anomalies like last year's second quarter due to weather or the seasonality of the second quarter in general to discern proper trends. You should do the same. It is a positive picture. 
Additionally, while we always experienced some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation. 
Lastly, and most importantly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by our many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and Tier 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that, for example, connects smart lighting with smartphones for retailers as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. 
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, while our strategies to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities. 
Further, as you know, we completed the acquisitions of the Juno Lighting Group and Geometri in December. We expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting, as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. As we noted in our press release, Juno had revenues of approximately $250 million in the trailing 12 months. We are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group. However, we do anticipate some modest short-term impact on their revenue growth rate as we integrate certain overlapping sales forces. This is a common phenomenon in our industry when acquisitions occur due to the nature of the specification construction cycle for commercial projects. 
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our growing business analytics capabilities as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users' need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering. 
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. 
Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our growth -- our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront, along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. 
As the North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries. 
Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have."

Again, today with the 8-K we filed will give you a 3-year trend of by quarter of what those amounts are, so you can get the trend in this recent quarter. Now we will have a little bit more restricted stock that we'll be issuing with these new acquisitions that would increase that a little bit. The reason we went to this is a variety of reasons. One, as we've indicated, we've made 3 acquisitions in the last 4 months, 2 of which are fairly sizable. The purchase accounting required by U.S. GAAP increases noncash amortization pretty significantly around trade names, around customers, around technology and so forth, that can really distort the historical and underlying performance of the business, we believe, if someone is really looking at how the business is performing versus these noncash items that you have to allocate the purchase price to that increased the amortization. And we're acquisitive and think we'll continue to do this. And then on the stock compensation, similarly, we issue stock many times to the key executives when we acquire a business to get their interest aligned with ours. Since they're our employees, you have to expense that. You can't put that as part of the purchase price. And so that's caused an increase. And then as we become more entrepreneurial and technology-focused internally, we're using that as a mechanism to incentivize and align employees' interest with shareholders. Lastly, I'd say when we looked at most of our public peer companies, they were making those same type of adjustments. And so we figured as we are comparing our results to now what Philips will spend out as their lighting business or OSRAM or go on down the list, they were adding back these items, so we thought it would be helpful to have us have an adjusted number on a comparable basis to what many of the other people in our industry are doing."

So we comment on mid- to upper single-digit. We're looking at the broad overall market.

But then there are other areas which tend to bring that down a little bit. So listen, we are responding to the marketplace in a very aggressive way. And we believe that our growth rates continue to outpace the overall growth rates in the market. You are absolutely correct. Given the specification cycle, the time frame, we tend to be -- we tend to lag what we -- what the, say, orders put in place or awards by anywhere from 6 to 9 months.

The overlap is like -- almost like a jigsaw puzzle coming together perfectly. The areas where they have strength, we actually have a need. And so when you think about our broad down lighting capability, they only enhance it. If you think about our track capability, we do track. But what they do with track is really -- it adds a better best capability to our good capability. So we view, from a product/solution perspective, a perfect combination. There is very little in the way of duplicity or an overlap. When it comes to our presence in channels, they are very strong in the residential channel. This gives us really an opportunity to be the market leader in that channel now. When you look at how they handle corporate accounts, they bring a unique capability. In fact, when we looked at the customer base, there's very, very little overlap. So both of us are now going to be able to take the other one's product solutions portfolio to the customers that we call on. So it's really a very opportunistic situation. And then when you look at the commercial markets, the ability to now have these portfolios be available through superior selling forces we think gives us a real opportunity. The Juno acquisition, yes, there will be certainly cost synergies. Purchasing, for example, maybe some duplicate warehousing, whatever. But this is really about growth synergies. The opportunity for both Juno and Acuity to attack some markets together will give us great strength. Markets where neither one of us really participated as well as we could. I look at the residential market where we both have strength, but now together, it really gives us an opportunity to participate in what I believe will be a decade-plus long growth in overall residential construction. It's interesting to me that when we look at residential construction on an inflation-adjusted basis, though U.S. residential construction market is still up almost 50% from its peak in 2006. So when you think about population growth over that last decade of probably 2% plus per annum, there is a whole lot of inventory that needs to be built to handle these changing trends. And so we are just very bullish around the whole opportunity of what Juno will bring. And you'll start to see those benefits manifest themselves over the next 12 to 18 months."

But for the most part, Acuity is extremely diversified. Our renovation capabilities are pretty robust so we continue to see opportunities both in new construction and renovation. And it's that diversification that has given us the ability to, if you will, ride out small little geographical nuances or issues and overall, deliver growth that is really quite robust. The lighting market and the nonresidential construction market for awards and construction put in place, as I mentioned earlier, do have a lag.

We have great access to market. But I would say that renovation continues to be a huge opportunity. Based on some of the data that we've seen, this may be a little bit old now, but if you look at outdoor lighting, the market is only 10% converted. If you look at indoor lighting, it's only 3% converted. So we see the renovation opportunity to continue to be very interesting to us given our access to market, our ability to create products that fit the needs of these markets. And as those prices come down in fixtures and solutions sets, the ability to sell those products in the markets where they have lower energy costs, now you can get the payback. So you'll -- we just believe that, that conversion over the next decade is going to be a robust opportunity, particularly for us. And so then when you add new construction on top of that, it's just -- it's like getting 2 scoops of ice cream. What will our mixed be? I don't have a good crystal ball around that. We're marching to a $5 billion business over the next handful of years and we can see the opportunities of serving both of those markets in an aggressive way.

To say overall, this is the direction of pricing and how does it compare one to the other, it just depends absolutely on the project. It depends on the vertical, it depends on the size of the capability. It depends on what someone's trying to do. If a big box retailer is converting a store from conventional lighting technology to digital lighting, it's -- the fixtures are primarily the same. They're very ubiquitous. So pricing is very, very aggressive. If someone is converting their law office and it's a very high end for conventional, usually they're choosing luminaires and solution sets that are very sophisticated, do many things and are generally more expensive. The margin dynamics for Acuity are very exciting for both because the cost structure just happens to be different, the cost to serve is different. So when you look at the expansion of our margins, I believe it's because of 2 things: one, we're growing our top line in areas that are very important, both new construction as well as renovation. But we continue to drive a great deal of productivity, cost out with the types of engineering capabilities and we're bringing new solution sets that add value. So I think you'll continue to see us improve our margins. And from a pricing perspective, it's really about how we bring value-add -- pricing in the marketplace has been consistent in how it approaches it for a long time. So we don't see any meaningful changes in how the market competes, if you will."

And so the notion of material cost and how we engineer products to cost out things and how we improve our productivity effects to a degree, the mix change, I would say that the market -- it has been fairly benign on a cost basis. We've seen some significant improvements in some areas only to see increases in cost, not necessarily commodity or material-based costs or component costs in other areas. So I think you'll continue to see us improve our margin. But mix, obviously, has a big influence on that. Sales volume has a big influence. We're not expecting any significant changes in material cost. We do think that health care costs will continue to rise. So we're always looking for ways to use our internal ABS process, our ability to improve productivity as ways to help offset some of those things. Because again, as you all know, we operate in a bid [ph] business kind of environment. So I would say that as you think about margins going forward, it really is more about our ability to drive volume, our ability to continue to drive productivity than it would be on any 1 given commodity cost component."

Because of the commentary that we've heard on this call. You all are starting to see the uptick in some of these areas, uncertain verticals and Acuity is well positioned to participate in that. So we are bullish about the long-term growth rates of our market. There is a lag for any type of what we'll call larger type medium to larger-type projects, simply because of the specification cycle to the construction cycle. There is a lot of opportunity to further renovate large spaces with digital lighting, particularly our digital lighting. Particularly our digital lighting that has the ability to really act as a digital pipe to enhance the notion of data collection and participation in the Internet of Things.

Our ability to drive an improvement in margin was again unit volume growth. But also, we are -- we're good at improving productivity within our facilities. We are good at looking to improve costouts of products that we have introduced because we have excellent engineering talent. So you're seeing Acuity at its best doing what it does best and that is growing its top line and continuing to look at every area of its business to improve its productivity while investing. We just opened up a new facility down in Mexico because we ran out of space. So we're absorbing that. And we're driving productivity there. We are just darnedably pleased, as Ricky pointed out. We moved into our new technology and innovation center in Decatur, where we repurposed an old factory that we had. And it's just an outstanding facility that will help us to not only retain our top talent, but to attract new talent as we continue to drive things. So this quarter, from a mix perspective and all that, I think, was fairly consistent. There was no new news there. But what you saw is Acuity just executing well."

The primary sales channel that they sell-through is the system integrator. The system integrator, you're absolutely right, they are very good at both new construction as well as renovation. We see a very, very complimentary opportunity going forward to have our local agents in that local system integrator work in ways to create a very strong specification for the combined capability of building automation systems of which lighting and lighting controls are a part. Bringing these things together so that they are extremely smart and extremely simple to use and simple to install, we believe is a powerful, powerful value proposition for customers. So the ability to begin targeting specification for whether it's new construction or renovation together we think is a huge opportunity. And just to tell you where we are on this, I mean, to use a baseball analogy, the managers are walking up to home plate to exchange their lineup cards. So we are just now getting after this. But the enthusiasm in certain markets between both agents and system integrators is really very, very interesting. And by the way, Geometri brings a sales channel to us that we have not participated in the past; and that's these value-added resellers. Their connectivity into large projects is quite robust. And so when you start to think about Acuity bringing in that holistic total building solution and you now add on top of that the ability to drive and collect business analytics, because again, we believe between Distech and Acuity's lighting control systems, that combination, we can collect north of 85% of all the data that's being created in a building. And now when you start to put the analytics behind it, both what we have today and we'll be at the Retail Federation show here in mid-January demonstrating again the robustness of our ByteLight, Visible Light Communication System, which is that indoor positioning; it's a robust combination. And now when you put on top of that Geometri's ability to derive analytics off of that, I'll tell you, Jed, it's a powerful combination. And we're just, obviously, starting this afresh."

We didn't -- there's nothing that I would say would be noteworthy in terms of the pricing dynamics that would be outside the norm, if you will. That",517,"So I'll answer the last part first. The competitive dynamics were again, consistent with what we've seen. We didn't -- there's nothing that I would say would be noteworthy in terms of the pricing dynamics that would be outside the norm, if you will. That doesn't mean that we don't experience -- we are at bid business, that we don't experience some competitive pressures, but I wouldn't call that out. On the variable contribution, folks, what you have to understand is that we are making investments in our business. We've done this for a long time. And it depends on the timing of some of these things. So this quarter, we -- the hiring that we did, we've added some tremendous capability that will drive revenues. And so those revenues will flow through without us having to add additional capabilities to garner those. And so you'll see this ebbing and flowing in our variable contribution margin. That's why we said mid- to upper single or mid- to upper 20s as a -- sort of a target. But ultimately, as the investment that we make and the investment base becomes pretty solid, we expect that the growth rates and our top line will meaningfully impact those variable contributions because we have the core competencies in place and we're now driving great revenues over that, if you will, new fixed base. Having said that, I think over the course of the year, you'll continue to see very favorable variable contribution margins. This quarter was smack-dab consistent to what we expected. And the things that are happening that represent huge growth opportunities. We're starting to see the benefit of those. We're starting to see the revenues rolling through. Our Tier 3 solutions, which again are off a very small base, the growth rate there is robust. And our margins, while we're trying to make sure we understand them, they're contributory, they're accretive to what we're doing overall. And again, just a final comment, the reason Ricky is now trying to give you a base to understand what our real margins are is because we do expect to continue to be acquisitive in driving our business. And the purchase accounting adjustments that we have to make off of the businesses that we've acquired, so for example, just take Distech, their margins were very consistent with ours. But once you do purchase accounting, all of a sudden, those margins change rather dramatically. Well, the way we look at the business and the way you look at the business is without some of those, if you will, U.S. GAAP purchase adjustments for these noncash items. The cash was already spent and so -- through the purchase price. So we're trying to give everyone a real apples-to-apples picture. And it's positive. I mean, when you compare our 17-plus percent adjusted -- further adjusted OP percentage number to our competitors on that same basis, it's a wow. And that's why we want to make sure that you -- all of you be these kinds of things because it's a -- really a positive picture."

With me today to discuss our fiscal 2016 second quarter results is Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dan Smith, our SVP, who is usually on the call with us is serving jury duty this week and probably won't be back until Monday. We are webcasting today's conference call at our website at www.acuitybrands.com.
I would like to remind everyone that during the call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which will identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.
First off, our results for the second quarter of 2016 were simply outstanding. There's no other way to describe them. Our net sales grew 26% while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 53%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics, including net sales and on an adjusted basis, gross profit margin, operating profit and diluted earnings per share. In fact, this was our 12th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, remarkable achievement. We believe these results yet again are strong evidence our strategies to provide customers with differentiated value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding allowing us to extend our leadership position.
These strategies include accretive acquisition, introduction of innovative, energy-efficient, lighting and building automation solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.
Also, in the quarter, we completed the acquisitions of Juno and Geometri. These are 2 great companies with extraordinarily talented associates that will meaningfully contribute to the growth of our tiered solution strategy.
Our results for the second quarter set records for Acuity even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth and areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solutions.
I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter. Net sales for the second quarter were $778 million, an increase of 26% compared with the year-ago period and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $106.7 million compared with reported operating profit of $78.6 million in the year-ago period. There was some minor adjustments in both quarters for certain special charges, which Ricky will describe later in the call.
Also, our reported operating profit included such items such as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with the acquisition of Juno, the cost of early termination of certain contracts at Juno, which were no longer necessary due to the acquisition and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit and inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles.
In order to make our quarterly results comparable between periods, we find it helpful to adjust both quarter's results by adding back these items. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $127.4 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $85.8 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 49%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.4%, up 250 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $1.80 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.18 in the year-ago period, up 53%. This is very compelling performance.
We closed the quarter with $224 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million for acquisition, leaving -- for acquisitions this year, leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further, we generated $120 million of net cash provided by operations in the first half of 2016, up $44 million from the year-ago period.
Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. Net sales for the second quarter grew 26% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales value grew by an impressive 17%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 11% -- 11 points, I should say. While foreign currency fluctuation primarily for the weakening Canadian dollar and changes in price mix each reduced net sales by 1 point.
While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing and like kind LED luminaires between periods reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs and to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels.
Sales of LED products grew over 40% this quarter compared with the year-ago period. An extraordinary achievement when one considers that LED -- that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for 55% of our total net sales, which as you know, includes non-fixture related products as well. We believe our rate of growth for LED solutions continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market-leading prowess.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to, yet again, achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted second quarter operating profit was $127.4 million, the most in our history and adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a second quarter record of 16.4%, up 250 basis points from the adjusted margin the year-ago period. Again, this is very robust performance as historically our lowest quarter due to seasonality.
Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 43.5%, up 200 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout the supply chain, and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past had lower gross profit margins than Acuity.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustment item noted earlier for each quarter were up $41 million or 24%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.1% in the current quarter, a decrease of 50 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to the higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisitions and to a lesser degree, higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation cost is, primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy.
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our second quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisition. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin was in mid-30s as a percentage of sales, well above our current target of mid- to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
On the strategic front, we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continue our rapid pace of introducing new products and solution, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solution. With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT applications.
We continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tier levels. The purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customer solutions that best meet their needs whether it be a single device, which we categorize as Tier 1 or a complete holistic integrated building automation and lighting solution, which we refer to as Tier 3 for their innovative or for their indoor -- for the indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise of security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri and Juno will meaningfully enhance our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio.
While sales data for our tiered solution is still imprecise and expanding off of a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solution were up more than 40% through the first half of this year over the year-ago period. Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4.
Before we execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers creating the best solutions for our customers applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increasing our salary and headcount to support the growth as part of our tiered solutions strategy.
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Today, we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers utilizing almost 200,000 Beacon enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with useful, actionable information. We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. The addition of Geometri will add -- will only add to our industry-leading capabilities.
Integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a stand-alone company, is moving along very well, particularly among the engineering, marketing and sales teams where we are adding new capabilities to create and market enhanced unified building and lighting systems as well as expand our access to customers in additional channels. We expect the combination of Acuity with its broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solution strategies -- strategy by offering a holistic unified solution that delivers true end-to-end optimization at all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment, and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
Through the execution of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. We expect these recent acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further service a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We've been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now 9,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.
We'd like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2016. Ricky?"

As Vern noted, we had a very strong second quarter performance on virtually all metrics including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will provide a bit more color on our second quarter results and our financial position.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find unusual to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we added back pretax $8 million or $0.12 per diluted share for various acquisition-related items. Pretax $6 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. $6.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share were share-based compensation expense and $0.1 million for special charges related to previously announced tree mining activities.
We adjusted prior year results for amortization of acquired intangible assets of $2.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, share-based compensation expense of $4.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share, acquisition-related fees of $7.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share and reversal of a special charge of $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.80 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 53% increase compared with the $1.18 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.
In addition, many of our peer companies makes these same adjustments. So what will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.
In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.2%, essentially flat with the 34.4% in the second quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and at the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
Cash flow generated from operations for the first half of fiscal year 2016 was an impressive $119.5 million, an increase of $44 million compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job this past quarter of managing operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory, less payable. As our working capital -- operating working capital net of the effects of acquisitions decreased by 6 days compared with last year to 35 days, which we believe is industry-leading.
In the first half of fiscal year 2016, we spent $43.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $27 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronic capacity and the build out of our innovation and technology center in Metro Atlanta, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenue in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016.
At February 29, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $224.3 million, a decrease of $532.5 million since August 31, 2015. Decrease was due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $613.7 million and capital expenditures of $43.8 million as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $11.4 million. Our total debt outstanding was $353.7 million at February 29, 2016. The ratio of debt, net of cash, the total capitalization net of cash was 8% at February 29, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at February 29, 2016 under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial streak and flexibility and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."

As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction particularly for Acuity.Our growth expectations for the lighting industry, primarily in North",1077,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction particularly for Acuity.
Our growth expectations for the lighting industry, primarily in North America has not really changed much over the last several quarters in spite of noise to the contrary. We remain very positive. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate our observations for fiscal 2016.
First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest but increasing pace. While forecasts for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is still expected to grow in the mid- to upper single-digit range for our fiscal 2016 reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the continued favorable trend in our March order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve and our business. Leading indicators for the North American market such as Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces by residential construction continues to grow nicely. 
Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input costs over the next 12 months. Further we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs.
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign-currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are impossible to predict.
Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix as well as the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.
Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the first half of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential, a positive picture. Additionally, while we always experienced some isolated pricing pressures at various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on our pricing. As we have said before many times, we will be -- we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.
Lastly, and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that for example, connect smart lighting with smartphones for retailers as well as our growing electronic and software capabilities.
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnective world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and they had much greater opportunities to offer our customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facility. While we are very early in this gain, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3 and the implementation of our IoT solution. Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as to enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we anticipated some modest short-term impact on their net sales as we integrated certain overlapping sales forces.
We are pleased to report a large portion of the integration of those sales forces has been completed and early indicators such as quote rates for Juno products are up significantly over the year-ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us.
Additionally, I would note, we are ahead of our internal schedule for the integration of Juno, which includes unifying our design and engineering teams as well as enhancing our expanded supply chain and streamlining our support activities.
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our expanding business analytics capabilities as part of our software solutions portfolio for retailers and other building users need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity.
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength we capitalized on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see a great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our growth supports this view.
As I've said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building automation system load experience significant growth over the next decade particularly as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years will provide us with significant growth potential. As the North American leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have."

Obviously, we have higher expectations that we'll be a large contributor as we continue to differentiate those capabilities in the market. From a Tier 4 perspective, we are generating revenues from business analytics and other capabilities within our Tier 4 service offering. But again, that is really small compared to the overall core business. And we're investing in that capability by adding additional software capability headcount, if you will, in that area as well as the Geometri acquisition. So profitability as we looked at it on a gross profit level will be quite high together for a very small base but we'll be talking about this over the next -- well, forever actually because this will be an integral part of the solutions capability that Acuity will provide its customers going forward."

But I've been with customers pretty aggressively over the last 90 days as we typically do and I would say that generally speaking, you hear little pockets of softness. But I think those are typically, driven by a local geography and potentially local issues. So if you imagine with the oil patch being soft, you might expect in some of those areas where folks are being served that if you're serving that type of capability, sure you'll see a little bit of softness. But in those markets, as we talk to our various customers and talk to our various selling forces, they see opportunities in other areas. So I would say that generally speaking, while folks were maybe a bit cautious in terms of their outlook, I believe that business activities still continue. Acuity is blessed because not only in the legacy business that we sell through 14 different channels touching the various markets in a very aggressive way. But with the additions of our recent acquisitions, including Distech, Geometri they added more capabilities, more channels for us to now touch customers in a way that they want to be touched. So I tend not to get too tied up in what 1 person or 2 people or someone says about something because of again, the opportunity that Acuity has to continue to touch those markets. Our order rate was strong and our shipments were strong as witnessed by our top line volume and it was broad-based throughout virtually all of the various end applications or end markets that we serve and virtually all of our channels or all of our channels in all of our geographies showed growth. So I can't really comment on what others may have said."

So you're just seeing what that delta difference, the operating profit off of the incremental sales. But just know that, that's not precisely how we would look at it. So you don't have that period-over-period. When we look at the legacy business where we did actually have sales in the year-ago period, let's pretend that this is a same-store sales kind of concept. That variable contribution margin came in, in the mid-30s. And again, we've tried to give guidance where our current target is kind of mid- to upper-20s because we are investing in capabilities to really drive our tiered solutions strategy. So I -- you're right. Our variable contribution margins were impressive and it had to deal with the fact that our gross profit margins improved, our company continues to do an excellent job in driving productivity throughout the organization. So you're really starting to see not only improvements in margin given the supply chain and other things that we're doing there but also the leverage on the SD&A. As these acquisitions come into fall and we have year-over-year comparability with them, I still see very positive variable contribution margins. So I still -- we would still like to see folks think about that mid to upper 20s because it's a little bit lumpy in terms of how we're investing in the great talent that we're being able to attract that is helping to drive our growth rates. As I pointed out, our Tier 3 solutions set, the growth rate there again off of a small base to the first 6 months for up 40%. And those are very telling signs of future opportunity."

Our expectation as we continue to expand our offerings in Tiers 3 and 4, which we expect will deliver higher gross profit margins but also as we continue to develop and hone our capabilities with the legacy Acuity, Distech and Juno in Tiers 1 and 2, we see that is also being a very powerful driver over the next 12 to 18 months. They obviously, for different reasons, expand our access to markets but also expand our capabilities in those various end markets and are growing. If you look at residential for the last couple of quarters -- last several quarters actually, residential continues to grow in sort of that low teens area. And Juno, combined with our Lithonia and other brand gives us a pretty robust offering there. So we're pretty excited about that. If we think about Distech and what it's doing, it has a very strong gross profit margin. So we want to continue to invest and we are investing to expand the portfolio that Distech and Acuity can offer in terms of the unified system but that would be a Tier 3. And we believe that, that overall system from a building management perspective gives building owners the opportunity to really drive the Internet of Things, which will allow us to develop a recurring revenue stream in the Tier 4 area for us. So the answer is yes. We would expect our variable contribution margins to expand over time. But right now, we're in a bit of an investing mode. If you look at our salary headcount, it has increased. So it's a bit difficult to precisely answer your question around the fixed variable piece. We prefer to target more as a percentage of sales. You saw us leverage this quarter. Our SD&A, we picked up about 50 basis points. So that was really helpful. It's interesting as we manage our business and I think our team was doing that very, very well. If you look at our salary and our wages as a percentage of our total revenues, it continues to show productivity there. So these investments are paying off and giving us more capability to drive more variable contribution margin as we differentiate our solution set. So I think the way we would ask folks to look at our SD&A is more as a percentage of sales and then hone in based on the last couple of questions, hone in on the variable contribution margin as we go forward. I think that, that picture will allow folks to test their models, create their models and measure our ability to execute against those in a very favorable way."

You're right. The acquisitions -- primarily the acquisition of Juno. Juno historically does have more operating working capital than we traditionally have as a percentage of revenue or in our turns and the way you look at it and it's really pretty much all 3 of the components or a bit opportunistic for us. The receivable days are higher. Their inventory is quite a bit higher and their payable days are shorter. So we do see opportunity as we continue to work with them and look at ways to integrate their back-office functions as well as some of the transactional areas to improve on that. So I do think you're going to continue to see us generating strong cash flow. The opportunity for the legacy business I think is still there on inventory. I feel pretty good where we are in receivable and payable days, they're industry-leading we believe not necessarily world-class. They're still opportunity for improvement but certainly, industry-leading in our industry. But we still see some opportunities to continue to work through working capital. The other variable beyond operating working capital is CapEx. You have seen a bit of a tick up in the last couple of years as we needed to expand our footprint, if you will, on office space for engineers primarily as well as a little bit of manufacturing. We're expanding some manufacturing capability as well. But I now also see some opportunity with the acquisitions to see how we can better get efficiencies out of that. So CapEx at the 2.5% I think is a good number for now. That's a low higher than we've historically run but I do see strong cash flow going forward as we continue to see opportunities to manage working capital particularly with the acquirer, businesses as well as inventory."

Our team has done just an outstanding job through the first half of generating cash flow from operations. I mean, if you look at $120 million up $44 million over the year-ago period and yet we paid out in the first quarter probably an extra $20 million of bonus over the year-ago period. So when you think about that, that cash flow performance is very robust. And as Ricky points out, this year is probably -- last year and this year, we've spent a little bit more as a percentage of sales than we typically have. My guess is that as we look out into '17 and '18, that number starts to come back to a little bit more closer to our historical number. But again, as we've pointed out earlier, Acuity is really a human capital business, and so adding the kind of skill sets and capabilities that are required to really drive our total solution set is what we're doing. And what we're seeing from a return of those investments are pretty robust."

Look, I -- we, the only way we're able to determine market share is through the imminent data. We only see ours compared to the total pie. We know we're continuing to drive share. But I believe that the bulk of that share gain, well, it's impossible to say precisely where it's coming from but I think that the world of renovation for Acuity is a strong contributor. And so I -- as we continue to drive those sorts of things, it's very favorable. The weather conditions this year seem to be a little bit more mild compared to said year-ago period. So potentially there's something there. When we look at our utility business, that's an outdoor business -- continue to have strong traction, but we've had strong traction period-over-period, sequential or year-over-year growth in those areas. So I just feel like our sales forces were executing well maybe weather gave us a little bit of a break, but we expect to continue to build on that. Tier 3 solutions, again, for the bulk of what we have, those are indoor activities, and so I don't know what those would've been we saw a nice growth there, but it's off of a pretty small base. So it's hard to precisely say why sequentially this year over that -- or excuse me, this quarter over the previous quarter. But I do really like what our selling forces are doing and how we're expanding our access and capabilities in the market. And I'm certain that, that had a contributing factor to the kind of performance that we had in this Q2."

If you look at what's happened over the last 3 years, I mean, it's 12 quarters in a row now of double-digit growth over a market that has typically grown between mid- to upper single digits. I think we have demonstrated a pretty good track record so far of meaningfully outperforming the growth rates of the markets that we serve. We are excited by the fact that nonresidential construction came in at very high single digits. I think it was almost 10% for the last couple of quarters. So as you know, lighting for new construction tends to lag. So that new construction opportunity we think is robust. And we continue to drive renovation opportunities in our business. So Chris, I would say absolutely that the historical trends is nothing that we can't see right now that would suggest that those things should be different."

And so -- in fact, we expect the growth to be robustly positive. What we did was we transitioned they're C&I sales for us to Acuity C&I Salesforce so that was a huge undertaking for which the Juno associate did just absolutely marvelous job, and so we believe that virtually every instance it was an upgrade to their C&I Salesforce. And so when you do that, you have disruption. And when you have a disruption, it usually creates problems within the specification cycle, which as you all know could be 60 to 180 days. So you tend to see a lag. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, you made the conversion very quickly. The teams did an outstanding job. That is virtually behind us. And so the quote activity that we're now seeing for Juno through the new selling forces in that C&I world are robustly up. And so we're pretty excited about what that would mean in the future. Is it going to translate into a superior growth next quarter? I would say that's probably a bit premature but it will translate into growth both on projects as well as new stock and flow as well as through various end verticals like residential, corporate accounts. So we're expecting the Juno team and the Acuity teams to really make hay in their end markets as we combine the businesses. And understand that there was overlap of product. Some of our products will be rebranded Juno and some of Juno's products will be rebranded into some of the Acuity Brands. So that we can really optimize how we are selling those products to end customers. That process still is ongoing but as I pointed out earlier, we are much further ahead than even our own aggressive internal integration plan. So we're pretty excited about what the entire Juno team now being part of the Acuity team means for our customers and our shareholder."

And so the math around that, if we are able to maintain our overall profitability on the declining price improves our margin. So our view is that there's no -- there's been no real change in the trend. There's been no real change in how competitors out there. It's a big business for most of what we do. And so we're competing everyday. And I don't know that we've seen any meaningful change in how our competitors compete. So I would say that it's still kind of more of the same at this point."

We're able to handle the incremental value without having to meaningfully increase our supply chain spending. So the variable contribution that comes off of that is quite favorable. I would say that as we priced product into the marketplace, that hasn't materially changed in terms of the trend that you've seen over the last several quarters. We continue to introduce new product and new solutions specs not too similar from Tier 3, which has the influence and the positive influence of maintaining and/or improving our margin. So you're seeing a little bit of that. But again, it's off a small base.

We tried to provide insight because we know that whenever you make acquisitions that are meaningful, it can distort historical comparison. So we tried to provide with the legacy business what that variable contribution margin looked like and contrast that with kind of what our target is. Our near-term target. Ultimately, we want our variable contribution margins to be much higher than what they are, right? That's what we get paid to do, deliver very high variable contribution margin but we're in an investing mode here in the near term and have been for a while so that's why trying to get people to understand why mid- to upper 20s for the legacy business is important. When you add the acquisitions on, right? There's nothing in the prior period. So you're seeing essentially that P&L down to operating profit flow through as the variable contribution. There's nothing to leverage it. Having said all of that, our feeling is that we will continue to drive the efficiencies, productivity throughout not only our core business but the acquisitions. It's going to be very difficult as we get into probably the fourth quarter than into 2017. We won't really talk about what's the legacy business versus the other businesses because Juno will be just part of the whole team. And we're doing lots of different things, as I've mentioned earlier, products that Juno sold under the Juno brand probably will fit in other brands that are within the current Acuity portfolio or the legacy portfolio. And a number of the products that were in the legacy portfolio are going to fit much better under the Juno brand. So our ability to sort of track and provide what variable contributions going to be by the separate entities, I think will become clouded. And so we'll do the best we can in the short-term. And so therefore, that pushes you to look at the overall consolidated here is what the sales growth was, here is what the operating profit contribution and not try to break it out by well, was it Distech, was it Juno, was it Acuity. Because they're all one. We're investing heavily to create these Tier 3 solutions that bring all of the capabilities of the acquisitions that we brought together. So if you do that this quarter, I believe that you see about a 25% variable contribution margin. And that's probably a better way to look at it because we will drive productivity improvements throughout the entire business and that includes all of the businesses that we've recently acquired. And those teams are excited about it because they want to take some of that variable contribution and reinvest it back in the business for superior growth. But I'd like the notion of saying, let's look at the whole thing. And then therefore, as you think about our volume going forward and our abilities to continue to outperform the markets we've grown, I think it gives you a pretty good opportunity to test your models and test how well, we're performing."

With me today to discuss our fiscal 2016 second quarter results is Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dan Smith, our SVP, who is usually on the call with us, is serving jury duty this week and probably won't be back until Monday. We are webcasting today's conference call at our website at www.acuitybrands.com.
I would like to remind everyone that during the call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which will identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.
First off, our results for the second quarter of 2016 were simply outstanding. There's no other way to describe them. Our net sales grew 26%, while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 53%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics, including net sales, and on an adjusted basis, gross profit margin, operating profit and diluted earnings per share. In fact, this was our 12th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement. We believe these results yet again are strong evidence of our strategies to provide customers with differentiated, value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position.  These strategies include accretive acquisition, introduction of innovative, energy-efficient, lighting and building automation solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity gain. 
Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisitions of Juno and Geometri. These are 2 great companies with extraordinarily talented associates that will meaningfully contribute to the growth of our tiered solution strategy.
Our results for the second quarter set records for Acuity even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth and areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio, as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solutions.
I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter. 
Net sales for the second quarter were $778 million, an increase of 26% compared with the year-ago period and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $106.7 million compared with reported operating profit of $78.6 million in the year-ago period. There was some minor adjustments in both quarters for certain special charges, which Ricky will describe later in the call.
Also, our reported operating profit included such items as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with the acquisition of Juno, the cost of early termination of certain contracts at Juno which were no longer necessary due to the acquisition and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit and inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles.
In order to make our quarterly results comparable between periods, we find it helpful to adjust both quarter's results by adding back these items. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $127.4 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $85.8 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 49%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.4%, up 250 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $1.80 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.18 in the year-ago period, up 53%. This is very compelling performance.
We closed the quarter with $224 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million for acquisition, leaving -- for acquisitions this year, leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further, we generated $120 million of net cash provided by operations in the first half of 2016, up $44 million from the year-ago period.
Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. 
Net sales for the second quarter grew 26% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew by an impressive 17%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 11% -- 11 points, I should say, while foreign currency fluctuation, primarily for the weakening Canadian dollar and changes in price mix, each reduced net sales by 1 point.
While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on like kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain LED component cost, and to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels.
Sales of LED products grew over 40% this quarter compared with the year-ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for 55% of our total net sales, which as you know, includes non-fixture related products as well. We believe our rate of growth for LED solutions continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market-leading prowess.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to, yet again, achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted second quarter operating profit was $127.4 million, the most in our history, and adjusted rate -- adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a second quarter record of 16.4%, up 250 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Again, this is very robust performance and historically our lowest quarter due to seasonality.
Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 43.5%, up 200 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout the supply chain, and lower input cost, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past has had lower gross profit margins than Acuity.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustment item noted earlier for each quarter, were up $41 million or 24%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.1% in the current quarter, a decrease of 50 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to the higher freight and commission cost to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisitions, and to a lesser degree, higher compensation cost. The increase in compensation cost is primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy.
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our second quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisition. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin was in mid-30s as a percentage of sales, well above our current target of mid- to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
On the strategic front, we continued to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solution. With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls, and now, building automation systems and IoT applications.
We continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tier levels. The purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device, which we categorize as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated building automation and lighting solution, which we refer to as Tier 3, for their innovative -- or for their indoor and -- for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise of security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri and Juno will meaningfully enhance our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio.
While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales at our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up more than 40% through the first half of this year over the year-ago period. Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4.
Before we execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' application. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions, as well as increasing our salaried headcount to support the growth as part of our tiered solutions strategy.
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart, connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Today, we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, utilizing almost 200,000 beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with useful, actionable information. We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. The addition of Geometri will add -- will only add to our industry-leading capabilities.
The integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a stand-alone company, is moving along very well, particularly among the engineering, marketing and sales teams where we are adding new capabilities to create and market enhanced unified building and lighting systems, as well as expand our access to customers in additional channels. We expect the combination of Acuity, with its broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering a holistic unified solution that delivers true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment, and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions, as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.  Through the execution of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect these recent acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further service a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now 9,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.
We'd like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2016. Ricky?"

As Vern noted, we had a very strong second quarter performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow.

As Vern noted, we had a very strong second quarter performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will provide a bit more color on our second quarter results and our financial position.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find usual to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we added back pretax $8 million or $0.12 per diluted share for various acquisition-related items; pretax $6 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets; $6.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share for share-based compensation expense; and $0.1 million for special charges related to previously announced streamlining activities.
We adjusted prior year results for amortization of acquired intangible assets of $2.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, share-based compensation expense of $4.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share, acquisition-related fees of $7.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share, and reversal of a special charge of $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.80 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 53% increase compared with the $1.18 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.  In addition, many of our peer companies makes these same adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.
In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.2%, essentially flat with the 34.4% in the second quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
Cash flow generated from operations for the first half of fiscal year 2016 was an impressive $119.5 million, an increase of $44 million compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job this past quarter of managing operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory, less payable. As our working capital -- operating working capital net of the effects of acquisitions decreased by 6 days compared with last year to 35 days, which we believe is industry-leading.
In the first half of fiscal year 2016, we spent $43.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $27 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronic capacity and the build out of our innovation and technology center in Metro Atlanta, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenue in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016.
At February 29, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $224.3 million, a decrease of $532.5 million since August 31, 2015. Decrease was due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $613.7 million and capital expenditures of $43.8 million, as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $11.4 million. Our total debt outstanding was $353.7 million at February 29, 2016. The ratio of debt net of cash to total capitalization net of cash was 8% at February 29, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at February 29, 2016 under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. 
We clearly enjoy significant financial stream and flexibility, and will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,327809170,957637,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for Acuity.Our growth expectations for the lighting industry, primarily in Nort",1076,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for Acuity.
Our growth expectations for the lighting industry, primarily in North America has not really changed much over the last several quarters in spite of noise to the contrary. We remain very positive. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate our observations for fiscal 2016.
First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest but increasing pace. While forecasts for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is still expected to grow in the mid- to upper single-digit range throughout fiscal 2016 reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the continued favorable trend in our March order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve and our business. Leading indicators for the North American market, such as Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. 
Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost over the next 12 months. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care cost. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are impossible to predict.
Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix, as well as the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix, and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.
Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the first half of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential, a positive picture. Additionally, while we always experienced some isolated pricing pressures at various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before many times, we will be -- we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.
Lastly, and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that, for example, connects smart lighting with smartphones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic and software capabilities.
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnective world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer our customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facility. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3 and the implementation of our IoT solution. 
Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting, as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we anticipated some modest short-term impact on their net sales as we integrated certain overlapping sales forces.
We are pleased to report a large portion of the integration of those sales forces has been completed and early indicators, such as quote rates for Juno products, are up significantly over the year-ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us.
Additionally, I would note we are ahead of our internal schedule for the integration of Juno, which includes unifying our design and engineering teams, as well as enhancing our expanded supply chain and streamlining our support activities.
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our expanding business analytics capabilities as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users' need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity.
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward --  expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see a great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our growth supports this view.
As I've said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry, as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront, along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the North American leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have."

But I've been with customers pretty aggressively here over the last 90 days, as we typically do. And I would say that generally speaking, you hear little pockets of softness, but I think that those are typically driven by a local geography and, potentially, local issues. So if you imagine, with the oil patch being soft, you might expect, in some of those areas where folks are being served, that if you're serving that type of capability, sure, you'll see a little bit of softness. But in those markets, as we talk to our various customers and talk to our various selling forces, they see opportunities in other areas. So I would say that, generally speaking, while folks were maybe a bit cautious in terms of their outlook, I believe that business activity still continued. Acuity is blessed because not only in the legacy business that we sell through 14 different channels touching the various markets in a very aggressive way, but with the additions of our recent acquisitions, including Distech, Geometri, they added more capabilities, more channels for us to now touch customers in a way that they want to be touched. So I tend not to get too tied up in what 1 person or 2 people or someone says about something because of, again, the opportunity that Acuity has to continue to touch those markets. Our order rate was strong and our shipments were strong, as witnessed by our top line volume and it was broad-based throughout virtually all of the various end applications or end markets that we serve and virtually all of our channels, or all of our channels in all of our geographies showed growth. So I can't really comment on what others may have said."

So you're just seeing what that delta difference, the operating profit off of the incremental sales. But just know that, that's not precisely how we would look at it. So you don't have that period-over-period. When we look at the legacy business, where we did actually have sales in the year-ago period -- let's pretend that this is a same-store sales kind of concept. That variable contribution margin came in, in the mid-30s. And again, we've tried to give guidance where our current target is kind of mid- to upper-20s because we are investing in capabilities to really drive our tiered solutions strategy. So I -- you're right. Our variable contribution margins were impressive and it had to do with the fact that our gross profit margins improved, our company continues to do an excellent job in driving productivity throughout the organization. So you're really starting to see not only improvements in margin due to supply chain and other things that we're doing there, but also the leverage on the SD&A. As these acquisitions come into full and we have year-over-year comparability with them, you'll still see very positive variable contribution margins. So I still -- we would still like to see folks think about that mid- to upper-20s because it's a little bit lumpy in terms of how we're investing in the great talent that we're being able to attract that is helping to drive our growth rates.

If you look at residential for the last couple of quarters -- last several quarters, actually, residential continues to grow in sort of that low-teens area. And Juno, combined with our Lithonia and other brand, gives us a pretty robust offering there. So we're pretty excited about that. If we think about Distech and what it's doing, it has a very strong gross profit margin, so we want to continue to invest and we are investing to expand the portfolio that Distech and Acuity can offer in terms of the unified system. That would be a Tier 3. And we believe that, that overall system, from a building management perspective, gives building owners the opportunity to really drive the Internet of Things, which will allow us to develop a recurring revenue stream in the Tier 4 area for us. So the answer is yes. We would expect our variable contribution margins to expand over time. But right now, we're in a bit of an investing mode. If you look at our salaried headcount, it has increased, so it's a bit difficult to precisely answer your question around the fixed variable piece. We prefer to target more as a percentage of sales. You saw us leverage this quarter our SD&A. We picked up about 50 basis points. So that was really helpful. It's interesting as we manage our business, and I think our team was doing that very, very well. If you look at our salary and our wages as a percentage of our total revenues, it continues to show productivity there. So these investments are paying off and giving us more capability to drive more variable contribution margin as we differentiate our solution set. So I think the way we would ask folks to look at our SD&A is more as a percentage of sales, and then hone in on -- based on the last couple of questions, hone in on the variable contribution margin as we go forward. I think that, that picture will allow folks to test their models, create their models and measure our ability to execute against those in a very favorable way."

You're right. The acquisitions -- primarily, the acquisition of Juno. Juno, historically, does have more operating working capital than we traditionally have as a percentage of revenue or on returns, either way you look at it. And it's really pretty much all 3 of the components are a bit opportunistic for us. The receivable days are higher, their inventory is quite a bit higher and their payable days are shorter. So we do see opportunity as we continue to work with them and look at ways to integrate their back-office functions, as well as some of the transactional areas to improve on that. So I do think you're going to continue to see us generating strong cash flow. The opportunity for the legacy business, I think, is still there on inventory. I feel pretty good where we are in receivable and payable days. They're industry-leading, we believe. Not necessarily world-class. There's still opportunity for improvement, but certainly, industry-leading in our industry. But we still see some opportunities to continue to work through working capital. The other variable beyond operating working capital is CapEx. You have seen a bit of a tick up in the last couple of years as we needed to expand our footprint, if you will, on office space for engineers primarily, as well as a little bit of manufacturing. We're expanding some manufacturing capability as well. But I now also see some opportunity with the acquisitions to see how we can better get efficiencies out of that. So CapEx at the 2.5% I think is a good number for now. That's a little higher than we've historically run. But I do see strong cash flow going forward as we continue to see opportunities to manage working capital, particularly with the acquired businesses as well as inventory."

Our team has done just an outstanding job through the first half of generating cash flow from operations.

So when you think about that, that cash flow performance is very robust. And as Ricky points out, this year is probably -- last year and this year, we've spent a little bit more as a percentage of sales than we typically have. My guess is that as we look out into '17 and '18, that number starts to come back to a little bit more closer to our historical number. But again, as we've pointed out earlier, Acuity is really a human capital business, and so adding the kind of skill sets and capabilities that are required to really drive our total solution set is what we're doing.

But I believe that, that -- the bulk of that share gain -- well, it's impossible to say precisely where it's coming from, but I think that the world of renovation for Acuity is a strong contributor. And so I -- as we continue to drive those sorts of things, it's very favorable. The weather conditions this year seemed to be a little bit more mild compared to, say, the year-ago period, so, potentially, there's something there. When we look at our utility business, that's an outdoor business, continue to have strong traction, but we've had strong traction period-over-period, sequential or year-over-year growth in those areas. So I just feel like our sales forces were executing well. Maybe weather gave us a little bit of a break. But we expect to continue to build on that. Tier 3 solutions, again, for the bulk of what we have, those are indoor activities, and so I don't know that those would've been -- again, we saw a nice growth there, but it's off of a pretty small base. So it's hard to precisely say why sequentially this year over that -- or excuse me, this quarter over the previous quarter. But I do really like what our selling forces are doing and how we're expanding our access and capabilities to market, and I'm certain that, that had a contributing factor to the kinds of performance that we had in this Q2."

We are excited by the fact that nonresidential construction came in at very high single digits. I think it was almost 10% for the last couple of quarters.

What we did, as we transitioned their C&I sales force to the Acuity C&I sales force, so that was a huge undertaking for which the Juno associates did just an absolutely marvelous job. And so, we believe that virtually every instance, it was an upgrade to their C&i sales force. And so when you do that, you have a disruption. And when you have a disruption, it usually creates problems within the specification cycle, which as you all know, can be 60 to 180 days. And so you tend to see a lag. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, you made the conversion very quickly. The teams did an outstanding job. That is virtually behind us. And so the quote activity that we're now seeing for Juno through the new selling forces in that C&I world are robustly up. And so we're pretty excited about what that will mean in the future. Is it going to translate into a superior growth next quarter? I would say that's probably a bit premature. But it will translate into growth both on projects, as well as through stock and flow, as well as through various end verticals like residential, corporate accounts. So we're expecting the Juno team and the Acuity teams to really make hay in their end markets as we combine the businesses. And understand that there was overlap of product. Some of our products will be re-branded Juno and some of Juno's products will be re-branded into some of the Acuity Brands so that we can really optimize how we are selling those products to end customers. That process still is ongoing, but as I pointed out earlier, we are much further ahead than even our own aggressive internal integration plans.

And to a degree, you have sometimes FX that influences that. But I think that overall, we continue to manage our overall supply chain well. We're able to handle the incremental volume without having to meaningfully increase our supply chain spending, so the variable contribution that comes off of that is quite favorable. I would say that as we priced product into the marketplace, that hasn't materially changed in terms of the trend that you've seen over the last several quarters. We continue to introduce new product and new solutions specs not too similar from Tier 3, which has the influence and the positive influence of maintaining and/or improving on our margins, so you're seeing a little bit of that. But again, it's off a small base. So I would say that the predominant reason for margin improvement is our supply chain's capability to handle increasing volume without adding a lot of cost, our ability to manage our input cost, and then to a lesser degree, [indiscernible]."

We tried to provide insight because we know that whenever you make acquisitions that are meaningful, it can distort historical comparison. So we tried to provide with the legacy business what that variable contribution margin looked like and contrast that with kind of what our target is, our near-term target. Ultimately, we want our variable contribution margins to be much higher than what they are, right? That's what we get paid to do, deliver very high variable contribution margin. But we're in an investing mode here in the near term and have been for a while, so that's why trying to get people to understand why mid- to upper-20s for the legacy business is important. When you add the acquisitions on, right, there's nothing in the prior period. So you're seeing essentially that P&L down to operating profit flow through as the variable contribution. There's nothing to leverage it. Having said all of that, our feeling is that we will continue to drive efficiencies, productivity throughout not only our core business, but the acquisitions. It's going to be very difficult as we get into probably the fourth quarter than into 2017. We won't really talk about what's the legacy business versus the other businesses because Juno will be just part of the whole team. And we're doing lots of different things, as I mentioned earlier, products that Juno sold under the Juno brand probably will fit in other brands better within the current Acuity portfolio or the legacy portfolio. And a number of the products that were in the legacy portfolio are going to fit much better under the Juno brand. So our ability to sort of track and provide what variable contributions going to be by these separate entities, I think, will become clouded. And so we'll do the best we can in the shorter term. So and then therefore, that pushes you to look at the overall consolidated. Here is what the sales growth was, here is what the operating profit contribution, and not trying to break it out by, was it Distech, was it Juno, was it Acuity, because they're all one. We're investing heavily to create these Tier 3 solutions that bring all of the capabilities of the acquisitions that we brought together. So if you do that this quarter, I believe that you'll see about a 25% variable contribution margin. And that's probably a better way to look at it because we will drive productivity improvements throughout the entire business, and that includes all of the businesses that we've recently acquired. And those teams are excited about it because they want to take some of that variable contribution and reinvest it back in the business for superior growth. So I like the notion of saying, let's look at the whole thing. And then therefore, as you think about our volume going forward and our abilities to continue to outperform the markets we grow, I think it gives you a pretty good opportunity to test your own models and test how well we're performing."

With me today to discuss our fiscal 2016 second quarter results is Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

With me today to discuss our fiscal 2016 second quarter results is Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dan Smith, our SVP, who is usually on the call with us, is serving jury duty this week and probably won't be back until Monday. We are webcasting today's conference call at our website at www.acuitybrands.com.
I would like to remind everyone that during the call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which will identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.
First off, our results for the second quarter of 2016 were simply outstanding. There's no other way to describe them. Our net sales grew 26%, while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 53%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics, including net sales, and on an adjusted basis, gross profit margin, operating profit and diluted earnings per share. In fact, this was our 12th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement. We believe these results, yet again, are strong evidence our strategies to provide customers with differentiated, value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position.  These strategies include accretive acquisition, introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting and building automation solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity gain. 
Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisitions of Juno and Geometri. These are 2 great companies with extraordinarily talented associates that will meaningfully contribute to the growth of our tiered solution strategy. Our results for the second quarter set records for Acuity even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth and areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio, as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solution.
I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.  Net sales for the second quarter were $778 million, an increase of 26% compared with the year-ago period and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $106.7 million compared with reported operating profit of $78.6 million in the year-ago period. There was some minor adjustments in both quarters for certain special charges, which Ricky will describe later in the call. Also, our reported operating profit included such items as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with the acquisition of Juno, the cost of early termination of certain contracts at Juno which were no longer necessary due to the acquisition and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit and inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles.
In order to make our quarterly results comparable between periods, we find it helpful to adjust both quarters' results by adding back these items. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $127.4 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $85.8 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 49%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.4%, up 250 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $1.80 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.18 in the year-ago period, up 53%. This is very compelling performance. We closed the quarter with $224 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million for acquisition, leaving -- for acquisitions this year, leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further, we generated $120 million of net cash provided by operations in the first half of 2016, up $44 million from the year-ago period.
Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. Net sales for the second quarter grew 26% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew by an impressive 17%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 11% -- 11 points, I should say, while foreign currency fluctuation, primarily for the weakening Canadian dollar and changes in price mix, each reduced net sales by 1 point.
While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on like kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain LED component cost, and to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products grew over 40% this quarter compared with the year-ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for 55% of our total net sales, which as you know, includes non-fixture related products as well. We believe our rate of growth for LED solutions continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market-leading prowess. Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to, yet again, achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted second quarter operating profit was $127.4 million, the most in our history, and adjusted rate -- adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a second quarter record of 16.4%, up 250 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Again, this is very robust performance in historically our lowest quarter due to seasonality.
Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 43.5%, up 200 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout the supply chain, and lower input cost, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past has had lower gross profit margins than Acuity.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustment items noted earlier for each quarter, were up $41 million or 24%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.1% in the current quarter, a decrease of 50 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to the higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisitions, and to a lesser degree, higher compensation cost. The increase in compensation cost is primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy. This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our second quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisition. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin was in mid-30s as a percentage of sales, well above our current target of mid- to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
On the strategic front, we continued to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solution. With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls, and now, building automation systems and IoT applications.
We continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tier levels. The purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device, which we categorize as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated building automation and lighting solution, which we refer to as Tier 3, for their innovative -- or for their indoor and -- for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise of security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri and Juno will meaningfully enhance our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio.
While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up more than 40% through the first half of this year over the year-ago period. Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4.
To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' application. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions, as well as increasing our salaried headcount to support the growth as part of our tiered solutions strategy.
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart, connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve. At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Today, we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, utilizing almost 200,000 beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with useful, actionable information. We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. The addition of Geometri will add -- will only add to our industry-leading capabilities.
The integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a stand-alone company, is moving along very well, particularly among the engineering, marketing and sales teams where we are adding new capabilities to create and market enhanced unified building and lighting systems, as well as expand our access to customers in additional channels. We expect the combination of Acuity, with its broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering a holistic unified solution that delivers true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment, and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions, as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.  Through the execution of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect these recent acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now 9,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.
We'd like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2016. Ricky?"
1413208,327809170,957667,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone.

As Vern noted, we had a very strong second quarter performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will provide a bit more color on our second quarter results and our financial position.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we added back pretax $8 million or $0.12 per diluted share for various acquisition-related items; pretax $6 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets; $6.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share for share-based compensation expense; and $0.1 million for special charges related to previously announced streamlining activities.
We adjusted prior year results for amortization of acquired intangible assets of $2.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, share-based compensation expense of $4.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share, acquisition-related fees of $7.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share, and reversal of a special charge of $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.80 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 53% increase compared with the $1.18 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.  In addition, many of our peer companies makes these same adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.
In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.2%, essentially flat with the 34.4% in the second quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
Cash flow generated from operations for the first half of fiscal year 2016 was an impressive $119.5 million, an increase of $44 million compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job this past quarter of managing operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory, less payable. As our working capital -- operating working capital net of the effects of acquisitions decreased by 6 days compared with last year to 35 days, which we believe is industry-leading.
In the first half of fiscal year 2016, we spent $43.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $27 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronic capacity and the build out of our innovation and technology center in Metro Atlanta, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenue in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016.
At February 29, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $224.3 million, a decrease of $532.5 million since August 31, 2015. Decrease was due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $613.7 million and capital expenditures of $43.8 million, as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $11.4 million. Our total debt outstanding was $353.7 million at February 29, 2016. The ratio of debt net of cash to total capitalization net of cash was 8% at February 29, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at February 29, 2016 under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019.  We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."

As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for Acuity. Our growth expectations for the lighting industry, primarily in North",1075,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for Acuity. Our growth expectations for the lighting industry, primarily in North America has not really changed much over the last several quarters in spite of noise to the contrary. We remain very positive. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate our observations for fiscal 2016.
First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest but increasing pace. While forecasts for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is still expected to grow in the mid- to upper single-digit range throughout fiscal 2016 reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the continued favorable trend in our March order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve and our business. Leading indicators for the North American market, such as Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely.  Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost over the next 12 months. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care cost. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are impossible to predict. Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix, as well as the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix, and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.
Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the first half of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential, a positive picture. Additionally, while we always experienced some isolated pricing pressures at various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before many times, we will be -- we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.
Lastly, and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that, for example, connect smart lighting with smartphones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic and software capabilities.
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnective world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer our customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facility. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3 and the implementation of our IoT solution. 
Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting, as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we anticipated some modest short-term impact on their net sales as we integrated certain overlapping sales forces. We are pleased to report a large portion of the integration of those sales forces has been completed and early indicators, such as quote rates for Juno products, are up significantly over the year-ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us. Additionally, I would note we are ahead of our internal schedule for the integration of Juno, which includes unifying our design and engineering teams, as well as enhancing our expanded supply chain and streamlining our support activities.
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our expanding business analytics capabilities as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users' need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity.
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: Expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see a great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our growth supports this view.
As I've said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry, as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront, along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the North American leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have."

Acuity is blessed because not only in the legacy business did we sell through 14 different channels touching the various markets in a very aggressive way, but with the additions of our recent acquisitions, including Distech, Geometri, they added more capabilities, more channels for us to now touch customers in a way that they want to be touched. So I tend not to get too tied up in what 1 person or 2 people or someone says about something because of, again, the opportunity that Acuity has to continue to touch those markets. Our order rate was strong and our shipments were strong, as witnessed by our top line volume. And it was broad-based throughout virtually all of the various end applications or end markets that we serve and virtually all of our channels, or all of our channels in all of our geographies showed growth. So I can't really comment on what others may have said."

So you're just seeing what that delta difference, the operating profit off of the incremental sales. But just know that, that's not precisely how we would look at it. So you don't have that period-over-period. When we look at the legacy business, where we did actually have sales in the year-ago period, let's pretend that this is a same-store sales kind of concept. That variable contribution margin came in, in the mid-30s. And again, we've tried to give guidance where our current target is kind of mid- to upper-20s because we are investing in capabilities to really drive our tiered solutions strategy. So I -- you're right. Our variable contribution margins were impressive and it had to do with the fact that our gross profit margins improved, our company continues to do an excellent job in driving productivity throughout the organization. So you're really starting to see not only improvements in margin due to supply chain and other things that we're doing there, but also the leverage on the SD&A. As these acquisitions come into full and we have year-over-year comparability with them, you'll still see very positive variable contribution margins. So I still -- we would still like to see folks think about that mid- to upper-20s because it's a little bit lumpy in terms of how we're investing in the great talent that we're being able to attract that is helping to drive our growth rates. As I pointed out, our Tier 3 solution set, the growth rates there, again, off of a small base through the first 6 months were up 40%. And those are very telling signs of future opportunity."

Our expectation, as we continue to expand our offerings in Tiers 3 and 4, which we expect will deliver higher gross profit margins, but also as we continue to develop and hone our capabilities with the legacy Acuity, Distech and Juno in Tiers 1 a",444,"It does. Our expectation, as we continue to expand our offerings in Tiers 3 and 4, which we expect will deliver higher gross profit margins, but also as we continue to develop and hone our capabilities with the legacy Acuity, Distech and Juno in Tiers 1 and 2, we see that as also being a very powerful driver over the next 12 to 18 months. They obviously, for different reasons, expand our access to market, but also expand our capabilities in those various end markets that are growing. If you look at residential for the last couple of quarters -- last several quarters, actually, residential continues to grow in sort of that low-teens area. And Juno, combined with our Lithonia and other brand, gives us a pretty robust offering there. So we're pretty excited about that. If we think about Distech and what it's doing, it has a very strong gross profit margin, so we want to continue to invest and we are investing to expand the portfolio that Distech and Acuity can offer in terms of a unified system. That would be a Tier 3. And we believe that, that overall system, from a building management perspective, gives building owners the opportunity to really drive the Internet of Things, which will allow us to develop a recurring revenue stream in the Tier 4 area for us. So the answer is yes, we would expect our variable contribution margins to expand over time. But right now, we're in a bit of an investing mode. If you look at our salaried headcount, it has increased, so it's a bit difficult to precisely answer your question around the fixed variable piece. We prefer to target more as a percentage of sales. You saw us leverage this quarter our SD&A. We picked up about 50 basis points. So that was really helpful. It's interesting as we manage our business, and I think our team was doing that very, very well. If you look at our salary and our wages as a percentage of our total revenues, continues to show productivity there. So these investments are paying off and giving us more capability to drive more variable contribution margin as we differentiate our solution set. So I think the way we would ask folks to look at our SD&A is more as a percentage of sales, and then hone in on -- based on the last couple of questions, hone in on the variable contribution margin as we go forward. I think that, that picture will allow folks to test their models, create their models and measure our ability to execute against those in a very favorable way."

You're right. The acquisitions -- primarily, the acquisition of Juno. Juno, historically, does have more operating working capital than we traditionally have as a percentage of revenue or on returns, either way you look at it. And it's really pretty much all 3 of the components are a bit opportunistic for us. Their receivable days are higher, their inventory is quite a bit higher and their payable days are shorter. So we do see opportunity as we continue to work with them and look at ways to integrate their back-office functions, as well as some of the transactional areas to improve on that. So I do think you're going to continue to see us generating strong cash flow. The opportunity for the legacy business, I think, is still there on inventory. I feel pretty good where we are in receivable and payable days. They're industry-leading, we believe. Not necessarily world-class. There's still opportunity for improvement, but certainly, industry-leading in our industry. But we still see some opportunities to continue to work through working capital. The other variable beyond operating working capital is CapEx. You have seen a bit of a tick up in the last couple of years as we needed to expand our footprint, if you will, on office space for engineers primarily, as well as a little bit in manufacturing. We're expanding some manufacturing capability as well. But I now also see some opportunity with the acquisitions to see how we can better get efficiencies out of that. So CapEx at the 2.5% I think is a good number for now. That's a little higher than we've historically run. But I do see strong cash flow going forward as we continue to see opportunities to manage working capital, particularly with the acquired businesses as well as inventory."

And so I -- as we continue to drive those sorts of things, it's very favorable. The weather conditions this year seemed to be a little bit more mild compared to, say, the year-ago period, so, potentially, there's something there. When we look at our utility business, that's an outdoor business, continue to have strong traction, but we've had strong traction period-over-period, sequential or year-over-year growth in those areas. So I just feel like our sales forces were executing well. Maybe weather gave us a little bit of a break. But we expect to continue to build on that. Tier 3 solutions, again, for the bulk of what we have, those are indoor activities, and so I don't know that those would have been -- again, we saw a nice growth there, but it's off of a pretty small base. So it's hard to precisely say why sequentially this year over that -- or excuse me, this quarter over the previous quarter. But I do really like what our selling forces are doing and how we're expanding our access and capabilities to market, and I'm certain that, that had a contributing factor to the kinds of performance that we had in this Q2."

And when you have a disruption, it usually creates problems within the specification cycle, which as you all know, can be 60 to 180 days. And so you tend to see a lag. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we made the conversion very quickly. The teams did an outstanding job. That is virtually behind us. And so the quote activity that we're now seeing for Juno through the new selling forces in that C&I world are robustly up. And so we're pretty excited about what that will mean in the future. Is it going to translate into a superior growth next quarter? I would say that's probably a bit premature. But it will translate into growth both on projects, as well as through stock and flow, as well as through various end verticals like residential, corporate accounts. So we're expecting the Juno team and the Acuity teams to really make hay in their end markets as we combine the businesses. And understand that there was overlap of product. Some of our products will be re-branded Juno and some of Juno's products will be re-branded into some of the Acuity Brands so that we can really optimize how we are selling those products to end customers.

We're able to handle the incremental volume without having to meaningfully increase our supply chain spending, so the variable contribution that comes off of that is quite favorable. I would say that as we priced product into the marketplace, that hasn't materially changed in terms of the trend that you've seen over the last several quarters. We continue to introduce new product and new solutions specs, not dissimilar from Tier 3, which has the influence and the positive influence of maintaining and/or improving on our margins, so you're seeing a little bit of that.

We tried to provide insight because we know that whenever you make acquisitions that are meaningful, it can distort historical comparison. So we tried to provide with the legacy business what that variable contribution margin looked like and contrast that with kind of what our target is, our near-term target. Ultimately, we want our variable contribution margins to be much higher than what they are, right? That's what we get paid to do, deliver very high variable contribution margin. But we're in an investing mode here in the near term and have been for a while, so that's why trying to get people to understand why mid- to upper-20s for the legacy business is important. When you add the acquisitions on, right, there's nothing in the prior period. So you're seeing essentially that P&L down to operating profit flow through as the variable contribution. There's nothing to leverage it. Having said all of that, our feeling is, is that we will continue to drive efficiencies, productivity throughout not only our core business, but the acquisitions. It's going to be very difficult as we get into probably the fourth quarter than into 2017. We won't really talk about what's the legacy business versus the other businesses because Juno will be just part of the whole team. And we're doing lots of different things, as I mentioned earlier, products that Juno sold under the Juno brand probably will fit in other brands better within the current Acuity portfolio or the legacy portfolio. And a number of the products that were in the legacy portfolio are going to fit much better under the Juno brand. So our ability to sort of track and provide what variable contributions going to be by these separate entities, I think, will become clouded. And so we'll do the best we can in the shorter term. So and then therefore, that pushes you to look at the overall consolidated, here is what the sales growth was, here is what the operating profit contribution, and not trying to break it out by, was it Distech, was it Juno, was it Acuity, because they're all one. We're investing heavily to create these Tier 3 solutions that bring all of the capabilities of the acquisitions that we brought together. So if you do that this quarter, I believe that you'll see about a 25% variable contribution margin. And that's probably a better way to look at it because we will drive productivity improvements throughout the entire business, and that includes all of the businesses that we've recently acquired. And those teams are excited about it because they want to take some of that variable contribution and reinvest it back in the business for superior growth. So I like the notion of saying, let's look at the whole thing. And then therefore, as you think about our volume going forward and our abilities to continue to outperform the markets we grow, I think it gives you a pretty good opportunity to test your own models and test how well we're performing."

The installed base of buildings for building management systems, for lighting systems and to create that unified capability is just huge. And people will invest if they can get paybacks around energy and/or get more value out of their space, a la the Internet of Things. So we see, just on a longer-term basis, a lot of growth. And the variable contribution margins off that growth in the future, we think, will be meaningfully higher than what we're guiding to in the shorter term."

First off, our results for the third quarter of 2016 were outstanding. Our net sales grew 25% while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 40%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics, including net sales and gross profit margin and on an adjusted basis, operating profit and diluted earnings per share. In fact, this was our 13th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit value growth, a remarkable achievement. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence, our strategies to provide customers with differentiated and value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position. 
These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting and building automation solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity gain. Our results for the third quarter set records for Acuity even as we continued to invest in our strong sales growth and areas with significant growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio, as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solution. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call. But I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.
Net sales for the third quarter were $852 million, an increase of 25% compared with the year-ago period and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $121 million compared with reported operating profit of $99.2 million in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special charges, which Ricky will describe later in the call. Also, our reported operating profit included such as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit and inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles.
In order to make our results comparable between periods, we find it helpful to add back these items to our reported results. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $146.1 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $108.1 million in the year ago period, an increase of 35%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 17.2%, up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.06 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.47 in the year-ago period, up 40%. This is compelling performance. 
We closed the quarter with $337 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million of acquisitions this year, leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further, we generated a record of $244 million from net cash provided by operations in the first 3 quarters of 2016, up $86 million or 54% from the year-ago period. Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find the results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. 
Net sales for the third quarter grew 25% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales value grew by an impressive 16%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points while changes in price mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on light kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline of certain component costs and to a lesser degree changes in mix and products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along those product lines and sales channels. 
Sales of LED products of Acuity now account for approximately 60% of our total net sales which, as you know, includes the sale of nonfixture-related products and solutions as well. Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again, achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter. 
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted third quarter operating profit was $146.1 million, the most in our history and adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a quarterly record of 17.2%, up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 44.5%, up 130 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout the supply chain, and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in the recent past has had a lower gross profit than Acuity. 
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses excluding the adjustment items noted earlier for each quarter were up $45.2 million or 24%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.3% in the current quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expenses was primarily due to higher freight in commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisition and to a lesser degree, higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our third quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisition. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 30%, well above our current target of mid to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter. On the strategic front, we continued to make great strides, starting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth to profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls as well as our building automation platform. 
With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT application. 
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy. For example, our innovative LED solutions are in multiple awards from the industry's most prestigious programs during LIGHTFAIR international, including the 2016 Innovation Awards and the next generation luminaires solid-state lighting design indoor competition. Additionally, we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solution strategy, which consists of 4 tiers. The purpose of this strategy is to lever our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs whether it be a single device, which we categorize as Tier 1 or a complete holistic, integrated lighting and building automation solutions, which we refer to as Tier 3 for the indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We delivered this comprehensive portfolio all with the premise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for our customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri and Juno has meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales data for our tiered solutions are still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales of our Tier 3 category, encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up approximately 40% through the first 3 quarters of this year over the year-ago period and now represent almost 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solutions. Fully executing our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers application. 
We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salary hand out to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solution strategy. Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart, connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, and with the addition of Distech controls, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve. 
At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Over the last 12 months, we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including Target and 2 other global leading retailers in smart lighting solutions. As part of their smart lighting solution, we currently have almost 200,000 maintenance-free, Beacon-enabled LED lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provides users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful, actionable information. We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. Importantly, we expect this installed base to quadruple by the end of 2016. Further, target selected Acuity as its exclusive smart lighting solutions provider. 
The integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets is more of a stand-alone company, is moving along very well. We expect the combination of Acuity with its broad industry-leading, solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic and unified solutions, that deliver true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupants experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and to provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building others. 
In fact, we just introduced end light eclipse, a powerful cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart buildings solution that unified lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution sets streamlines building programming, facilitates our smart multi-zone daylight harvesting and colored tuning capabilities and enhances IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease of installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like this as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is driving the evolution of smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect this recent strategic acquisition, coupled with our aggressive but internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation as we further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and result of our now 10,000 associates. We are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call. 
I would like to now turn over the call to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2016. Ricky?"

As Vern noted, we had a strong third quarter performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll provide a bit more color on our record third quarter results and our financial contribution. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable. 
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we added back $1 million or $0.02 per diluted share for various acquisition-related items, $11.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets, $6.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share for share-based compensation expense and $9.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share for special charges related to streamlining activities, including integration of recent acquisitions and consolidation of certain production activities. 
We adjusted prior year results for amortizations of acquired intangible assets of $2.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, share-based compensation expense of $4.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share, acquisition-related items of $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share, and special charge of $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share. In addition, we adjusted prior year results for the gain on financial instruments used to hedge the Distech Canadian dollar purchase price of $10.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.06 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 40% increase compared with $1.47 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. 
We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of the performance. In addition, many of our peer companies make the same adjustments so it will help you as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $9.7 million for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities include the consolidations of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. We expect to achieve net annual savings of at least twice the amount of the special charge commencing at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with these and potential future integration and streamlining activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared with 36% in the third quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year. Cash flow generations from operations for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2016 was an impressive $243.9 million, an increase of $85.7 million or 54% compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job this quarter of managing operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventories, less payables. As our operating working capital, net of the effective acquisitions decreased by 1 day compared with last year to 41 days, which we believe is industry-leading. 
In the first 9 months of fiscal year 2016, we spent $61.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $42.3 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronic capacity and building out of our innovation and technologies in Metro Atlanta, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016. 
At May 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalent balance of $337 million, a decrease of $419.8 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily for cash used to fund acquisitions of $613.7 million and capital expenditures of $61.8 million, as well as the pay dividends to shareholders of $17.1 million. Our total debt outstanding was $354.4 million at May 31, 2016. The ratio of debt net of cash to total capitalization net of cash was 1.1% at May 31, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at May 31, 2016, under our credit facility which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,347040280,1003231,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 29, 2016",2016-06-29,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Last week's U.K. referendum about the European Union has created a great deal of uncertainty an",1129,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Last week's U.K. referendum about the European Union has created a great deal of uncertainty and generated significant volatility in the global financial markets over concerns regarding the potential impact, if any, on the global economy. This uncertainty and volatility have the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which could negatively impact global economic activity. This notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observations. 
First, the consensus estimate for independent third-party forecasters calls for the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales to grow to mid to upper single-digit range through fiscal 2016, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the favorable trend in our June order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve and our business. Leading indicators for the North American markets such as architectural building index, vacancy rates, office, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces while residential construction continues to grow nicely. 
Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline and steel costs, which have risen recently, we do not anticipate significant changes in most input cost over the next 12 months. We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be weary of foreign exchange rate fluctuation, particularly during this period of uncertainty caused by the U.K. announcement last week. Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation, price product and sales channel mix as well as current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as volumes grow and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to the integration of recent acquisitions. Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a positive picture. 
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation. Lastly, and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that for example, connects smart lighting with smartphones for retailers as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our key customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base by the end of 2016. 
As we have noted in the last several conference call, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world, is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3 and the implementation of our IoT solutions. Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. 
As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we experienced some modest short-term impact on their net sales as we integrated certain overlapping sales force. We are pleased to report the integration of those sales forces has been substantially completed and early indicators such as quote rates for Juno products are up significantly over the year-ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us. 
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company will enhance our outstanding business analytics capability as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity. Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: Expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength, and capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholder with superior return. While it takes focus and resources, we are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. 
Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and the lighting-related industry as well as building automation solutions market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued and more importantly the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size to more efficient solutions particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years will provide us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries. 
Thank you. And with that, we'll entertain any questions that you have."

We have a very strong brand in both industrial and roadway as well as other types of indoor capabilities. So we will continue to drive our productivity, our focus in those markets with those products. We focus on the U.K., we focus on Germany and Northern Europe. We have a capability in Spain. And my sense is while there is a great deal of uncertainty going on right now, which could have some impact on our order rate, we still think it's a bullish opportunity because of what certain markets and certain countries are doing in terms of their industrial output. So while Europe represents our sales outside of North America represent really only 3% of our total, we continue to like the strategy that we have in Europe and that is to focus on key customers sets, key channels with key products that we have and maintain our capability there. If there are opportunities that come up, we'll look at them. But they have to be very consistent with our strategy. In terms of acquisitions overall, we continue to see a very interesting pipeline.

Obviously, Juno is a great example of bolt-on tuck-in type acquisitions, it fills gaps that we have. They will more likely look to acquire as opposed to invest in, but we do see a robust pipeline and we think it's likely in both of those areas to continue to see us be active where it supports our strategic focus and create value at a reasonable price."

In my prepared remarks, I said that Tier 3 solutions through the first 3 months and again, it's coming off of a smaller base and our measuring capabilities in the prior periods weren't as robust as they were today, but we guesstimate that Tier 3 portion of our business, which now represents almost 10% of our business grew at approximately 40% growth rate. When we think about how we have invested in our tiered solutions strategy, I mean, our headcount, including acquisitions this year is probably up in the salary headcount area close to 30%. And while we don't specifically allocate all capabilities by tiers because of the way products can work and migrate through the tiers and supports the tiers, it's not really an effective use to allocate. But what I can say is that when we look at things specific to our tiered solutions strategy, like our ability to develop software whether it be firmware that makes our entire Tier 3 solution work well between various control components, Distech of course, and our lighting business, that group has expanded by a factor of 4. We probably had 18 months ago, less than 20 folks in this group. Today, we have over, while we're approaching 80 folks by the end of the year, we'll probably have close to 100 on our way, probably 250 [ph] people and it's really because of the opportunities that we see in supporting the Tier 3, Tier 4 solution set. We are very pleased to announce that Target selected us as their exclusive smart lighting solutions provider. The opportunity to provide them not only with lightning solutions that enhance energy efficiency but provide them with other opportunities to do things is really an example of how we're moving, but investing in and growing our Tier 3 solution strategy. So more to come.

I think what's more interesting than trying to put a numerical number around it and it's not just Target, it's the whole notion of how the installed base not just in retail but when you think about other very large buildings orders, whether it's campuses or universities or research centers, these large installed base is the opportunity to convert them from traditional lighting to smart lighting solutions really is not only for energy savings, but daylight harvesting, the ability to make the visual space better more effective. The opportunity to participate in the Internet of Things as data collection points, that's what we find really fascinating. So our relationship with Target is a decades old long relationship. They're a great customer. And we dedicate significant resources to making sure that we are meeting their needs at every step. So it's an example of our access to market and then bringing these solutions fast to the market that are allowing us to drive Tier 3. So when I think about the total market, DOE says that there's 100 million square feet of building space that is in the U.S. 70% of which was put in place before 1990. A few years ago, we estimated that the -- to convert that installed base, might've been about $3 a square foot for lighting and controls. Today, we believe that number is much higher because of the true value add that can be brought through smart lighting. And the target situation is just an example and there are many, many many more. So without focusing too much on Target, we are focusing more on what Target represents as a leader in the retail space and taking a leadership position to make the conversion to smart lighting, I think that's what's really interesting. And then how that expands and extends to other folks that are different subsets of the retail market which, as you know, is huge so that they can take advantage of smart lighting. That's the potential. I think that the market that's out there, the installed base is enormous in size and represents an enormous opportunity for Acuity as we go forward."

Today, you still have technologies that are out there that are using battery-powered beacons. And somehow, they are trying to say that, that is the equivalent. It's really a shame because those -- that old technology, that old solutions that people are saying, while I have that too, it's really not the same. And as people become more comfortable and I understand the solution set, what Acuity offers is really huge. The introduction of end light eclipse for example, is just another example of the Tier 3 solutions set that allows us to get after building owners, not just retailers but all building owners in a way that allows us to optimize their lighting while driving great unification between HVAC systems, submetering, security and lighting, and allowing us to do this in a very, very clever and simple way.

We will continue to direct investment and continue to drive productivity in our business and consider this a productivity opportunity where we can continue to invest. This quarter, we delivered on the legacy business about 30% variable contribution. So it's higher than what we kind of have been targeting into that mid to upper 20s. So we're always looking to optimize in the short-term, what we're doing in terms of variable contribution margin so we can drive our results. But we're doing that against the backdrop of long-term investment opportunities. And for us, mostly that's human capital. We're spending right now in CapEx about 2.5% of sales, a little bit higher than what we normally do, but we're still investing at a very rapid pace in our human talent. As I mentioned earlier, including acquisition, our salary headcount is up about 30%. But interestingly, our SD&A as a percentage of total sales, we picked up about 10 bps. So we're looking to leverage our base while investing, so to say precisely that all of those savings are going to enhance variable contribution, we're looking at balancing off both investing for the short-term as well as driving -- investing for the longer-term while investing our delivery shorter term as well."

Overall, we believe that our mix of business is tilted to -- we guesstimated 50% renovation, 50% new construction. It's probably tilting a little bit more towards renovation, and I would see that over time, it may even tilt more because the installed base is so enormous. And the opportunity there is to provide value solutions sets to end customers where there is no alternative. They're not building something they're not renovating, we call that unplanned renovation, but it's because the payback and the opportunity of the new solutions set is so compelling that they'd want to make that unplanned renovation. I would say new construction, it continues to move along at a solid, but yet somewhat of a -- almost a schizophrenic pace. We see spurts and then we see declines. We see spurts and decline. And that has to do with the entire geography because we serve so many different markets. It's difficult to discern an absolute trend. There is no doubt that we went through here over the last 18 months, changes in oil prices that some of the activities in those oil patch areas slow down a little. But yet in other areas around technology, we see all those markets continue to expand. So I feel generally speaking that as employment continues to improve, we're seeing broad-based improvement in commercial office buildings. We're seeing improvements in health care as budgets of states continue to improve. We're seeing spending in education both K-12 as well as higher education. The industrial segment continues to move along nicely. Roadway seems to be moving along quite nicely. So I think all in all, we're continuing to see improvement on a gradual basis, but it's the renovation market that allows us to continue to drive our growth in a solid way. Europe, we'll wait and see what happens there. And obviously, that uncertainty is out there. But I don't feel like the contagion of anything that may go on in that will spill over here. Just to reiterate 97% of our revenues are generated here. We have a great business in the U.K. and in Spain. Obviously, U.K.'s products just got a heck of a lot cheaper for people to now acquire them and mainland Europe. So we continue to be bullish on the overall opportunities for Acuity."

It took a lot of time to develop, a lot of hard work. But the end light eclipse system will be the backbone in terms of creating a very, very simple, single piece of glass for users to now manage the face of their building in a much more simple and effective way. So we're very excited about the possibilities and the opportunities of that. Because its applicability again, think of education, campuses of any type, commercial office buildings, health care facility and you can just keep going on, buildings of any type are really good opportunities here. And given the connectivity that we have through contractors, engineers, lighting designers and system integrators and then their own form of contractors, this will allow us to sell those value propositions and the ease of installation, the ease of programming is really going to be a point of key differentiation and then the end user has very, very simple tools or simple to use, but massive tools that are available to help drive the effectiveness of their building."

Now as many of you know, steel has taken a quick V turn, not even a U turn, a V turn, based on the tariffs that have been imposed on steel to where we see steel rise 35-something-percent here in the last few months. So I -- it'll be interesting to see how quick the market reacts to passing that on, historically where the industry has passed that on.

And we don't have specific dates. But my two cents is based on the question that we had earlier, the activity and the interest level is increasing at a very high rate. And our ability to position ourselves and have dialogue with these very same customers is robust. And retailers are very, very focused on the quality of life in their store. They're very focused on energy savings. They're very focus on these types of things, so the transition from conventional fluorescent lighting into LED, while it's very interesting, they're doing it because they see multiple opportunities around it. I mentioned Target only by way of example, and when you think about the installed base, I want to keep bringing us back to that. It is so enormous in terms of the potential for conversion that this is where our excitement is. It's not -- for the investing public, you guys have said they'll give us some evidence that Tier 3 solutions that our strategy could work. Our growth there has been quite significant as a percentage of our sales. It's now becoming significant. This was a customer that made a move. It's just a continuation of the margin towards the huge opportunity that's out there. So you're right, I'm not going to mention other names. But what I want to make sure investors understand is that the opportunity to all of these verticals is quite enormous. And so we're looking at all of those verticals. And we're attacking them as we have with bigger, and we're selling the solution sets because we believe that we have great sales forces that know how to sell these type of solution sets. So it gives us a leg up and making sure that we're first. And I would expect us to continue to expect the growth rates of the markets that we serve because of these types of opportunities. Again, the installed base is enormous. It's much larger, it could be substantially larger than what new construction represents for a long time to come because of its size and scale. So that's where I would like to direct your attention and your focus. If you look at what our growth rates have been over the last 13 quarters, double-digit growth rates have outperformed the growth rate of the markets we serve. We're doing a good job bringing the margin to bear. People have asked us about margins, you have into Tier 3. Just a quick comment. If I look back over the last 3 years where we've been implementing this tiered strategy approach, we've picked up close to 400 basis points on our gross profit margin and almost 500 basis points on our operating profit margin during that time period. So while lots of things are happening to improve our business as we migrate and as we expand, it's probably a better word in Tier 3 solutions strategy, you're seeing how it's influencing in a favorable way, our margin impact and while we're investing. I mean, this has been a continuous comment that we've made. We're investing today because we see the opportunity tomorrow. We started that a while back and you're seeing the return and the benefit off, of that. Our cash flow return on investment is still is in the low 30 percentile, which is -- puts us in the 90 bp [ph] percentile in terms of performance capabilities there. But I think we're doing all of this right."

We -- just simply because pricing of componentry comes down. As Ricky pointed out earlier, it can find its way back into the market. We deal in a bid world, but we're all trying to differentiate or -- at least Acuity is trying to differentiate its features and benefits relative to the price. And I think we have been successful in convincing our customers of the true value of the solution set that we bring. Again, while we're up against competitors that are bringing battery-powered beacons to the marketplace, that's old news. People who are installing that type of technology are making a huge mistake. It's almost irresponsible of them to do that. The fact of the matter is that Acuity continues to drive that productivity, drive the change in its value propositions so that it can continue to extract the value of our gross profit margin, if you will, for that value. I expect that the trend to continue. We tend to look at gross profit over annual periods, it's not quarterly periods. I know that you all have to look at everything on a quarterly basis. But I think if you look at that type of thing over an annual basis, you will see that continuous improvement in our businesses is allowing us to improve margins. Volume, as that increases we're able to extract that variable contribution. Mix, as we continue to grow Tier 3, but let's be clear. Tier 1 and Tier 2 are critically important and we do well there as well in terms of margin profile. But there's no doubt that Tier 3 and Tier 4 have gross profit margin dynamics that are accretive to what we're doing today. So we would expect to see that trend continue. In the pricing, as Ricky pointed out earlier, on component cost, it's an ebbing and flowing. That's something that we've always had to manage. What's more important about it, is if you can continue to have improvements even incremental improvements in technology. And that goes back into the fluorescent world. Just imagine where it went from T-12 to T-8 to T-5. Same scenario. So simply because it's an LED light source, it hasn't really changed how we think about the internal workings of our business and how we see the marketplace. We're always trying to sell value, new technology. LED is an enabler for us to selling more value, i.e. Internet of Things, combined solutions sets for energy savings. That's how we're driving the value. And I expect the trend to continue."

So just wondering how did those trends compared to what you're seeing in your business? And then on outdoor specifically, I know there's been a lot to talk on the retail channel and building automation.

Our growth rates are exceeding the overall growth rates of the market. The reason for the penetration and outdoor is the total cost and ownership type of thing, the whole notion of whether it's industrial outdoor or whether it's a street or roadway, these luminaires are very expensive to have to change light bulbs and maintain. So LED is a perfect opportunity to act great value there. So the penetration rate of outdoor makes complete sense to me and i expect that to continue. But let me remind everyone, it's still only 20%. There's another 80% that's out there and that 80% market that continues to by itself, just an outdoor to be in an enormous market by itself. In other areas of the business, we are very excited about the introduction of end light eclipse and other components off of that, the ability to -- we'll have some more comments later, the ability to separate meter, we believe it's going to allow Acuity with this lighting solution, building automation solutions that after that commercial office market, the installed base, which is converted very, very slowly primarily because most of the commercial buildings are socialized utilities. So it's hard to actually get down to what you are consuming in terms of energy, you just pay it based on square footage. So we're very excited about the potential of converting that type of market as we go forward. Ricky, other end markets, I would say, we would see again, continued opportunities for further penetration. I think that the notion of what retail is doing, retail is looking at max energy savings, but what more can occur there, that's a big space."

We're very well penetrated in that indoor space and would expect to fully participate as that conversion accelerates where it's been the fastest today, as more where you've had energy sources that were less energy efficient incandescent high pressure sodium, H.I.D. that had issues not just with energy, but slow would come on hard to control, those types of things that are driving this conversion."

So we don't sell bulbs, but we obviously, create kits that are very cost-effective and very, very efficient. That portion of our business continues to grow very nicely.

First off, our results for the third quarter of 2016 were outstanding. Our net sales grew 25% while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 40%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics, including net sales and gross profit margin; and on an adjusted basis, operating profit and diluted earnings per share. In fact, this was our 13th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit value growth, a remarkable achievement. We believe these results are yet again a strong evidence our strategies to provide customers with differentiated, value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position.
These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting and building automation solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity gains. Our results for the third quarter set records for Acuity even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth in areas with significant growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solution. I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call. But I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.
Net sales for the third quarter were $852 million, an increase of 25% compared with a year-ago period and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $121 million compared with reported operating profit of $99.2 million in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special charges, which Ricky will describe later in the call. Also, our reported operating profit included items such as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles.
In order to make our results comparable between periods, we find it helpful to add back these items to our reported results. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $146.1 million compared with an adjusted operating profit of $108.1 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 35%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 17.2%, up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.06 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.47 in the year-ago period, up 40%. This is compelling performance.
We closed the quarter with $337 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million for acquisitions this year, leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further, we generated a record of $244 million from net cash provided by operations in the first 3 quarters of 2016, up $86 million or 54% from the year-ago period. Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis.
Net sales for the third quarter grew 25% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales value grew by an impressive 16%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points while changes in price/mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on light-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain component costs and, to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels.
Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for approximately 60% of our total net sales which, as you know, includes the sale of nonfixture-related products and solutions as well.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted third quarter operating profit was $146.1 million, the most in our history; and adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a quarterly record of 17.2%, up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 44.5%, up 130 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past has had a lower gross profit margin than Acuity.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustment items noted earlier for each quarter, were up $45.2 million or 24%. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.3% in the current quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisitions and, to a lesser degree, higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy.
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our third quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisition. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 30%, well above our current target of mid to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
On the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our Lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls as well as our building automation platform.
With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT application.
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy. For example, our innovative LED solutions earned multiple awards from the industry's most prestigious programs during LIGHTFAIR International, including the 2016 LFI Innovation Awards and the Next Generation Luminaires Solid-State Lighting Design indoor competition.
Additionally, we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tiers. The purpose of this strategy is to lever our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device, which we categorize as Tier 1; or a complete holistic, integrated lighting and building automation solutions, which we refer to as Tier 3 for the indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with a promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for our customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri and Juno have meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales data for our tiered solutions are still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales of our Tier 3 category, encompassing our holistic integrated solutions, were up approximately 40% through the first 3 quarters of this year over the year-ago period and now represent almost 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solution. To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' application.
We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salary headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy. Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings, and the opportunity to have a smart, connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application and with the addition of Distech controls, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Over the last 12 months, we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including Target and 2 other global leading retailers, to smart lighting solution. As part of their smart lighting solution, we currently have almost 200,000 maintenance-free, beacon-enabled LED lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful, actionable information. We believe this level of capability in deployment is unmatched in our industry. Importantly, we expect this installed base to quadruple by the end of 2016. Further, Target selected Acuity as its exclusive smart lighting solutions provider. 
The integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a stand-alone company, is moving along very well. We expect the combination of Acuity with its broad industry-leading, solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solution and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic, unified solutions that deliver true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
In fact, we just introduced nLight eclipse, a powerful, cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solution that unifies lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines building programming, facilitates our smart multi-zone daylight harvesting and color-tuning capabilities and enhances IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease of installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is driving the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect these recent strategic acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation as we further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because we -- of the dedication and resolve of our now 10,000 associates. We are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.
I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2016. Ricky?"

As Vern noted, we had a strong third quarter performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll provide a bit more color on our record third quarter results and our financial position. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we added back $1 million or $0.02 per diluted share for various acquisition-related items, $7.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets, $6.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share for share-based compensation expense and $9.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share for special charges related to streamlining activities, including integration of recent acquisitions and consolidation of certain production activities.
We adjusted prior year results for amortizations of acquired intangible assets of $2.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, share-based compensation expense of $4.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share, acquisition-related items of $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share and special charge of $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share. In addition, we adjusted prior year results for the gain on financial instruments used to hedge the Distech Canadian dollar purchase price of $10.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.06 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 40% increase compared with $1.47 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations.
We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. In addition, many of our peer companies make these same adjustments so it will help you as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $9.7 million for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities include the consolidations of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. We expect to achieve net annual savings of at least twice the amount of the special charge commencing at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with these and potential future integration and streamlining activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared with 36% in the third quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
Cash flow generated from operations for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2016 was an impressive $243.9 million, an increase of $85.7 million or 54% compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job this quarter of managing operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital, net of the effect of acquisitions decreased by 1 day compared with last year to 41 days, which we believe is industry leading.
In the first 9 months of fiscal year 2016, we spent $61.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $42.3 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronic capacity and building out of our innovation and technology center in metro Atlanta, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016.
At May 31, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $337 million, a decrease of $419.8 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily for cash used to fund acquisitions of $613.7 million and capital expenditures of $61.8 million as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $17.1 million. Our total debt outstanding was $354.4 million at May 31, 2016. The ratio of debt net of cash to total capitalization net of cash was 1.1% at May 31, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at May 31, 2016, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.

As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity.

As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Last week's U.K. referendum vote to exit [ph] the European Union has created a great deal of uncertainty and generated significant volatility in the global financial markets over concerns regarding the potential impact, if any, on the global economy. This uncertainty and volatility have the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which could negatively impact global economic activity. This notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observation.
First, the consensus estimate from independent third-party forecasters calls for the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales, to grow to mid to upper single-digit range through fiscal 2016, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the favorable trend in our June order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve and our business. Leading indicators for the North American markets such as Architectural Billings Index, vacancy rates, office, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely.
Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline and steel costs, which have risen recently, we do not anticipate significant changes in most input costs over the next 12 months. We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs.
Next, we continue to be weary of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly during this period of uncertainty caused by the U.K. announcement last week.
Another observation: While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation, price, product and sale channel mix as well as current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as volumes grow and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to the integration of recent acquisition. Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a positive picture.
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.
Lastly and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that, for example, connects smart lighting with smartphones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our key customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base by the end of 2016.
As we have noted in the last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3 and the implementation of our IoT solution.
Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels.
As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we experienced some modest short-term impact on their net sales as we integrated certain overlapping sales forces. We are pleased to report the integration of those sales forces has been substantially completed and early indicators, such as quote rates for Juno products, are up significantly over the year-ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us.
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our expanding business analytics capability as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users' need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity. Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength and capitalize on the market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior return. It all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity.
Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and, more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient solutions, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries. 
Thank you. And with that, we'll entertain any questions that you have."

We have a very strong brand in both industrial and roadway as well as other types of indoor capabilities. So we will continue to drive our productivity, our focus in those markets with those products. We focus on U.K., we focus on Germany and Northern Europe. We have a capability in Spain. And my sense is, is that while there's a great deal of uncertainty going on right now, which could have some impact on our order rate, we still think it's a bullish opportunity because of what certain markets and certain countries are doing in terms of their industrial output. So while Europe represents -- or sales outside of North America represent really only 3% of our total, we continue to like the strategy that we have in Europe, and that is to focus on key customer sets, key channels with key products that we have and maintain our capability there. If there are opportunities that come up, we'll look at them. But they have to be very consistent with our strategy. In terms of acquisitions overall, we continue to see a very interesting pipeline. And Ricky, why don't I ask you to comment on that?"

We continue, as Vern said, to see a very robust opportunity for acquisitions. Our focus is in 2 primary areas: technology. And there, we continue to see opportunities not only to acquire, but to make investments in, minority or larger investments in; or to partner; or lastly, to just have a commercial relationship to share technology on a licensing-type arrangement. So we do see a lot of opportunities there and continue to be very active in pursuing opportunities to expand our capability in technology. The other area is in bolt-on, tuck-in-type acquisitions both for our luminaire business as well as our control, building management business. There, too, we're seeing a robust pipeline. Obviously, Juno is a great example of bolt-on, tuck-in-type acquisitions that fills gaps that we have. There, we'll more likely, obviously, look to acquire as opposed to invest in. But we do see a robust pipeline, and I think it's likely in both of those areas to continue to see us be active where it supports our strategic focus and creates value at a reasonable price."

In my prepared remarks, I said that Tier 3 solutions through the first 3 months, and again, it's coming off of a smaller base and our measuring capabilities in the prior periods weren't as robust as they are today, but we guesstimate that Tier 3 portion of our business, which now represents almost 10% of our business, grew at approximately a 40% growth rate. When we think about how we have invested in our tiered solutions strategy, I mean, our headcount, including acquisitions this year, is probably up in the salary headcount area close to 30%. And while we don't specifically allocate all capabilities by tiers because of the way products can work and migrate through the tiers and support the tiers, it's not really an effective use to allocate. But what I can say is that when we look at things specific to our tiered solutions strategy, like our ability to develop software, whether it be firmware that makes our entire Tier 3 solution work well between various control components, Distech, of course, and our lighting business, that group has expanded by a factor of 4. We probably had 18 months ago less than 20 folks in this group. Today, we have over -- well, we're approaching 80 folks and by the end of the year we'll probably have close to 100 on our way, probably 250 people. And it's really because of the opportunities that we see in supporting the Tier 3, Tier 4 solution set. We are very pleased to announce that Target selected us as their exclusive smart lighting solutions provider. The opportunity to provide them not only with lighting solutions that enhance energy efficiency, but to provide them with other opportunities to do things is really an example of how we're moving -- not moving it but investing in and growing our Tier 3 solutions strategy. So more to come. We're in the very early innings of this game, and we're very excited about the potential of what this tiered solutions strategy will afford for you as shareholders and for our customers as a solution set."

I think what's more interesting than trying to put a numerical number around it -- and it's not just Target, it's the whole notion of how the installed base not just in retail but when you think about other very large building owners, whether it's campuses or universities or research centers, these large installed bases, the opportunity to convert them from traditional lighting to smart lighting solutions really is not only for energy savings, but daylight harvesting, the ability to make the visual space better, more effective, the opportunity to participate in the Internet of Things as data collection points, that's what we find really fascinating. So our relationship with Target is a decades-old long relationship. They're a great customer. And we dedicate significant resources to making sure that we are meeting their needs at every step. So it's an example of our access to market and then bringing these solution sets to the market that are allowing us to drive Tier 3. So when I think about the total market, DOE says that there's 100 billion square feet of building space that is in the U.S. 70% of which was put in place before 1990. A few years ago, we estimated that the -- to convert that installed base might have been about $3 a square foot for lighting and controls. Today, we believe that number is much higher because of the true value add that can be brought through smart lighting. And the Target situation is just an example, and there are many, many, many more. So without focusing too much on Target but focusing more on what Target represents as a leader in the retail space and taking a leadership position to make the conversion to smart lighting, I think that's what's really interesting. And then how that expands and extends to other folks that are different subsets of the retail market which, as you know, is huge, so that they can take advantage of smart lighting, that's the potential. I think that the market that's out there, that installed base is enormous in size and represents an enormous opportunity for Acuity as we go forward."

It's users of space that are looking to optimize how they use the space not just from an energy savings standpoint, but how can quality of light enhance what they're doing, how can these luminaires that -- can be enabled in a much more effective way. Today -- and you still have technologies that are out there that are using battery-powered beacons. And somehow, they are trying to say that, that is the equivalent. It's really a shame because those -- that old technology, those old solutions that people are saying, ""well, I have that too,"" it's really not the same. And as people become more comfortable and understand the solution set, what Acuity offers is really huge. The introduction of nLight eclipse, for example, is just another example of a Tier 3 solution set that allows us to get after building owners, not just retailers but all building owners, in a way that allows us to optimize their lighting, while driving great unification between the HVAC systems, submetering, security and lighting and allowing us to do this in a very, very clever and simple way. It doesn't exist in the marketplace. So we're excited about that whole approach to the installed base because of its size and scale."

And some of those are difficult decisions of what we're not going to do because there's still some market that we see so much potential in, again, Tier 3 and Tier 4 and what it can mean for that installed base. We will continue to direct investment and continue to drive productivity in our business, and I'll consider this a productivity opportunity, where we can continue to invest. This quarter, we delivered on the legacy business about 30% variable contribution. So it's higher than what we kind of have been targeting into that mid to upper 20s. So we're always looking to optimize in the short term what we're doing in terms of variable contribution margin so we can drive our result, but we're doing that against the backdrop of long-term investment opportunities. And for us, mostly that's human capital. We're spending right now in CapEx about 2.5% of sales, a little bit higher than what we normally do, but we're still investing at a very rapid pace in our human talent. As I mentioned earlier, including acquisitions, our salary headcount is up about 30%. But interestingly, our SDA as a percentage of total sales, we picked up about 10 bps. So we're looking to leverage our base while investing. So to say precisely that all of those savings are going to enhance variable contribution, we're looking at balancing off both investing for the short term as well as driving -- excuse me, investing for the longer term while investing or delivering shorter term as well."

And I would see that over time, it may even tilt more because the installed base is so enormous. And the opportunity there is to provide value and solution sets to end customers where there is no alternative. They're not building something. They're not renovating. So we call that unplanned renovation. But it's because the payback and the opportunity of the new solution set is so compelling that they want to make that unplanned renovation. I would say new construction, it continues to move along at a solid but yet somewhat of a -- almost a schizophrenic pace. We see spurts and then we see declines. We see spurts and decline. And that has to do with the entire geography. Because we serve so many different markets, it's difficult to discern an absolute trend. There is no doubt that when we went through here over the last 18 months changes in oil prices, that some of the activities in those oil patch areas slowed down a little. But yet in other areas, technology, we see those markets continuing to expand. So I feel, generally speaking, that as employment continues to improve, we're seeing broad-based improvement in commercial office buildings. We're seeing improvements in health care as budgets of states continue to improve. We're seeing spending in education both K-12 as well as higher education. The industrial segment continues to move along nicely. Roadway seems to be moving along quite nicely. So I think, all in all, we're continuing to see improvement on a gradual basis, but it's the renovation market that allows us to continue to drive our growth in a solid way. Europe, we'll wait and see what happens there. Obviously, that uncertainty is out there. But I don't feel like the contagion of anything that may go on there will spill over here. Just to reiterate, 97% of our revenues are generated here. We have a great business in the U.K. and in Spain. Obviously, U.K.'s products just got a heck of a lot cheaper for people to now acquire them in Mainland Europe. So we continue to be bullish on the overall opportunities for Acuity."

But the nLight eclipse system will be the backbone in terms of creating a very, very simple, single piece of glass for building users to now manage the affairs of their building in a much more simple and effective way. So we're very excited about the possibilities and the opportunities of that. Because its applicability -- again, think of education campuses of any type, commercial office buildings, health care facility, and you can just keep going on, buildings of any type are really the opportunity here. And given the connectivity that we have through contractors, engineers, lighting designers and they through system integrators and then their own form of contractors, this will allow us to sell those value propositions and the ease of installation, the ease of programming is really going to be a point of key differentiation. And then the end user has, again, very, very simple tools -- or simple to use but massive tools that are available to help drive the effectiveness of their building."

We have seen a kind of trough in not just LED component, which is the primary driver of that, but steel and other areas that kind of hit a trough. And there's a little bit of lag on when that gets in pricing that I think impacted that. Those kinds of cost reductions in commodities such as steel, aluminum, copper do get passed on pretty quickly in our industry. Now as many of you know, steel has taken a quick V turn, not even a U turn, a V turn based on the tariffs that have been imposed on steel to where we've seen steel rise 35-something percent here in the last few months. So I -- it'll be interesting to see how quick the market reacts to passing that on. Historically, they've been -- the industry has passed that on. But I would say it's still predominantly due to passing on reduction in our input costs, predominantly LED. But we have seen some reduction in others that have caused that number to round to 2% instead of the 1%."

And we don't have specific dates. But my two cents is that based on the question that we had earlier, the activity and the interest level is increasing at a very high rate. And our ability to position ourselves and have dialogue with these very same customers is robust. And retailers are very, very focused on the quality of light in their store. They're very focused on energy savings. They're very focused on these types of things. So the transition from conventional fluorescent lighting into LED, while it's very interesting, they're doing it because they see multiple opportunities around it. I mentioned Target only by way of example. And when you think about the installed base, I want to keep bringing us back to that, it is so enormous in terms of the potential for conversion that this is where our excitement is. It's not -- for the investing public, you guys have said, well, give us some evidence that the Tier 3 solution set or strategy could work. Our growth there has been quite significant as a percentage of our sales. It's now becoming significant. This was a customer that made a move. It's just -- it's a continuation of the march towards the huge opportunity that's out there. So you're right, I'm not going to mention other names. But what I want to make sure investors understand is that the opportunity through all of these verticals is quite enormous. And so we're looking at all those verticals. And we're attacking them as we have with vigor. And we're selling the solution sets, we believe, that we have great sales forces that know how to sell these types of solution sets. So it gives us a leg up in making sure that we're first. And I would expect us to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve because of these types of opportunities. Again, the installed base is enormous. It's much larger. It could be substantially larger than what new construction represents for a long time to come because of its size and its scale. So that's where I'd like to direct your attention and your focus. If you look at what our growth rates have been over the last 13 quarters, double-digit growth rates, we've outperformed the growth rates of the markets we serve. We're doing a good job bringing the margin to bear. People have asked us about margins you have in Tier 3. Just a quick comment, if I look back over the last 3 years where we've been implementing this tiered strategy approach, we've picked up close to 400 basis points on our gross profit margin and almost 500 basis points on our operating profit margin during that time period. So while lots of things are happening to improve our business, as we migrate and as we expand, that's probably a better word, in our Tier 3 solutions strategy, you're seeing how it's influencing in a favorable way our margin impact and while we're investing. I mean, this has been a continuous comment that we've made. We're investing today because we see the opportunity tomorrow. We started that a while back, and you're seeing the return and the benefit off of that. Our cash flow return on investment is still is in the low 30 percentile, which is -- puts us in the 90 bp percentile in terms of performance capabilities there. But I think we're doing all of this right."

We -- just simply because pricing of componentry comes down, as Ricky pointed out earlier, it can find its way back into the market. We deal on a bid world, but we're all trying to differentiate or at least Acuity is trying to differentiate its features and benefits relative to the price. And I think we have been successful in convincing our customers of the true value of the solution set that we bring. Again, when we're up against competitors that are bringing battery-powered beacons to the marketplace, that's old news. People who are installing that type of technology are making a huge mistake. It's almost irresponsible of them -- for them to do that. The fact of the matter is, is that Acuity continues to drive that productivity, drive the change in its value propositions so that it can continue to extract the value of our gross profit margin, if you will, for that value. I expect that the trend to continue. We tend to look at gross profit over annual periods, not quarterly periods. I know that you all have to look at everything on a quarterly basis. But I think if you look at that type of thing over an annual basis, you'll see that continuous improvement in our business is allowing us to improve margins. Volume, as that increases, we're able to extract that variable contribution; mix, as we continue to grow Tier 3. But let's be clear, Tier 1 and Tier 2 are critically important and we do well there as well in terms of margin profile. But there's no doubt that Tier 3 and Tier 4 have gross profit margin dynamics that are accretive to what we're doing today. So we would expect to see that trend continue. The pricing, as Ricky pointed out earlier, on component costs, it's an ebbing and flowing. It's something that we've always had to manage. What's more important about it is if you can continue to have improvements, even incremental improvements in technology. And that goes back into the fluorescent world. Just imagine when it went from T-12 to T-8 to T-5, same scenario. So simply because it's an LED light source, it hasn't really changed how we think about the internal workings of our business and how we compete in the marketplace. We're always trying to sell value, the new technology. LED is an enabler for us to selling more value, i.e. Internet of Things, combined solution sets for energy savings. That's how we're driving the value, and I expect the trend to continue."

So wondering, how do those trends compare to what you're seeing in your business? And then on outdoor specifically, I know there's been a lot of talk about the retail channel and building automation.

I can only comment on our outdoor business, and that continues to grow at a very nice pace. So we're actually gaining share nicely there. We're -- our growth rates are exceeding the overall growth rates of the market. The reason for the penetration in outdoor is it's a total cost of ownership-type thing, the whole notion of whether it's an industrial outdoor or whether it's a street or roadway, these luminaires are very expensive to have to change light bulbs and maintain. So LED is a perfect opportunity to effect great value there. So the penetration rate of outdoor makes complete sense to me, and I expect that to continue. But let me remind everyone, it's still only 20%. There's another 80% that's out there, and that 80% market continues to -- by itself, just in outdoor, to be an enormous market by itself. In other areas of the business, we are very excited about the introduction of nLight eclipse and other components off of that, the ability to -- we'll have some more comments on this later. The ability to separate meter, we believe, is going to allow Acuity with this lighting solution, this building automation solution set to get after that commercial office market, the installed base, which is converted very, very slowly, primarily because most commercial buildings are socialized utilities. So it's hard to actually get down to what are you consuming in terms of energy. You just pay it based on square footage. So we're very excited about the potential of converting that type of market as we go forward. Ricky, other end markets? I would say we see, again, continued opportunities for further penetration. I think that the notion of what retail is doing, retail is looking at not just energy savings, but what more can occur there, that's a big space."

If you've upgraded to high-output T-8 or T-5, that's still a very energy-efficient light source, so the conversion is slower. But you're now seeing LED pulling away from the lumens per watt in the capability of fluorescent, so I do think it will accelerate there. We're very well penetrated in that indoor space and would expect to fully participate as that conversion accelerates. About where it's been the fastest to date is more where you've had energy sources that were less energy efficient, incandescent, high pressure sodium HID that had issues not just energy, but slow to come on, hard to control, those type of things that are driving this conversion."

So we don't sell bulbs, but we obviously create kits that are very cost effective and very, very efficient. That portion of our business continues to grow very nicely.

First off, our results for the third quarter of 2016 were outstanding. Our net sales grew 25% while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 40%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics, including net sales and gross profit margin; and on an adjusted basis, operating profit and diluted earnings per share. In fact, this was our 13th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit value growth, a remarkable achievement. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence our strategies to provide customers with differentiated, value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position.
These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting and building automation solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity gain. Our results for the third quarter set records for Acuity even as we continued to invest in our strong sales growth in areas with significant growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solution. I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call. But I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.
Net sales for the third quarter were $852 million, an increase of 25% compared to the year-ago period and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $121 million compared with reported operating profit of $99.2 million in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special charges, which Ricky will describe later in the call. Also, our reported operating profit included items such as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles.
In order to make our results comparable between periods, we find it helpful to add back these items to our reported results. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $146.1 million compared with an adjusted operating profit of $108.1 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 35%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 17.2%, up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.06 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.47 in the year-ago period, up 40%. This is compelling performance.
We closed the quarter with $337 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million for acquisitions this year, leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further, we generated a record $244 million from net cash provided by operations in the first 3 quarters of 2016, up $86 million or 54% from the year-ago period. Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis.
Net sales for the third quarter grew 25% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales value grew by an impressive 16%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points while changes in price/mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on light-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain component costs and, to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels.
Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for approximately 60% of our total net sales which, as you know, includes the sale of nonfixture-related products and solutions as well.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted third quarter operating profit was $146.1 million, the most in our history; and adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a quarterly record of 17.2%, up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 44.5%, up 130 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past has had a lower gross profit margin than Acuity.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustment items noted earlier for each quarter, were up $45.2 million or 24%. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.3% in the current quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisitions and, to a lesser degree, higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy.
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our third quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisition. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 30%, well above our current target of mid to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
On the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our Lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls as well as our building automation platform.
With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT application.
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy. For example, our innovative LED solutions earned multiple awards from the industry's most prestigious programs during LIGHTFAIR International, including the 2016 LFI Innovation Awards and the Next Generation Luminaires Solid-State Lighting Design indoor competition.
Additionally, we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tiers. The purpose of this strategy is to lever our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device, which we categorize as Tier 1; or complete holistic, integrated lighting and building automation solutions, which we refer to as Tier 3 for the indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for our customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri and Juno have meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales dated for our tiered solutions are still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales of our Tier 3 category, encompassing our holistic integrated solutions, were up approximately 40% through the first 3 quarters of this year over the year-ago period and now represent almost 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solution. To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' application.
We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salary headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy. Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings, and the opportunity to have a smart, connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application and with the addition of Distech controls, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Over the last 12 months, we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including Target and 2 other global leading retailers, to smart lighting solution. As part of their smart lighting solution, we currently have almost 200,000 maintenance-free, beacon-enabled LED lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful, actionable information. We believe this level of capability in deployment is unmatched in our industry. Importantly, we expect this installed base to quadruple by the end of 2016. Further, Target selected Acuity as its exclusive smart lighting solutions provider. 
The integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a stand-alone company, is moving along very well. We expect the combination of Acuity with its broad industry-leading, solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solution and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic, unified solutions that deliver true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reduction as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
In fact, we just introduced nLight eclipse, a powerful, cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solution that unifies lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines building programming, facilitates our smart multi-zone daylight harvesting and color-tuning capabilities and enhances IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease of installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is driving the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect these recent strategic acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation as we further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because we -- of the dedication and resolve of our now 10,000 associates. We are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.

As Vern noted, we had a strong third quarter performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll provide a bit more color on our record third quarter results and our financial position. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we added back $1 million or $0.02 per diluted share for various acquisition-related items, $7.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets, $6.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share for share-based compensation expense and $9.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share for special charges related to streamlining activities, including integration of recent acquisitions and consolidation of certain production activities.
We adjusted prior year results for amortizations of acquired intangible assets of $2.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, share-based compensation expense of $4.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share, acquisition-related items of $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share and special charge of $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share. In addition, we adjusted prior year results for the gain on financial instruments used to hedge the Distech Canadian dollar purchase price of $10.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.06 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 40% increase compared with $1.47 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations.
We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. In addition, many of our peer companies make these same adjustments in order to help you as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $9.7 million for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities include the consolidations of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. We expect to achieve net annual savings of at least twice the amount of the special charge commencing at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with these and potential future integration and streamlining activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared with 36% in the third quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
Cash flow generated from operations for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2016 was an impressive $243.9 million, an increase of $85.7 million or 54% compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job this quarter of managing operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital, net of the effect of acquisitions, decreased by 1 day compared with last year to 41 days, which we believe is industry leading.
In the first 9 months of fiscal year 2016, we spent $61.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $42.3 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronic capacity and building out of our innovation and technology center in metro Atlanta, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016.
At May 31, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $337 million, a decrease of $419.8 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily for cash used to fund acquisitions of $613.7 million and capital expenditures of $61.8 million as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $17.1 million. Our total debt outstanding was $354.4 million at May 31, 2016. The ratio of debt net of cash to total capitalization net of cash was 1.1% at May 31, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at May 31, 2016, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,347040280,1003412,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 29, 2016",2016-06-29,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity.

As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Last week's U.K. referendum vote to exit [ph] the European Union has created a great deal of uncertainty and generated significant volatility in the global financial markets over concerns regarding the potential impact, if any, on the global economy. This uncertainty and volatility have the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which could negatively impact global economic activity. This notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observation.
First, the consensus estimate from independent third-party forecasters calls for the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales, to grow to mid- to upper single-digit range through fiscal 2016, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the favorable trend in our June order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve and our business. Leading indicators for the North American markets such as Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely.
Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, and steel costs, which have risen recently, we do not anticipate significant changes in most input costs over the next 12 months. We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs.
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly during this period of uncertainty caused by the U.K. announcement last week.
Another observation: While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation, price, product and sale channel mix as well as current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as volumes grow and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to the integration of recent acquisition. Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a positive picture.
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.
Lastly and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that, for example, connect smart lighting with smartphones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our key customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base by the end of 2016.
As we have noted in the last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3 and the implementation of our IoT solution.
Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels.
As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we experienced some modest short-term impact on their net sales as we integrated certain overlapping sales forces. We are pleased to report the integration of those sales forces has been substantially completed and early indicators, such as quote rates for Juno products, are up significantly over the year-ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us.
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our expanding business analytics capability as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users' need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity. Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength and capitalize on the market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior return. It all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity.
Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and, more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient solutions, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries. 
Thank you. And with that, we'll entertain any questions that you have."

We have a very strong brand in both industrial and roadway as well as other types of indoor capabilities. So we will continue to drive our productivity, our focus in those markets with those products. We focus on U.K., we focus on Germany and Northern Europe. We have a capability in Spain. And my sense is, is that while there's a great deal of uncertainty going on right now, which could have some impact on our order rate, we still think it's a bullish opportunity because of what certain markets in certain countries are doing in terms of their industrial output. So while Europe represents -- or sales outside of North America represent really only 3% of our total, we continue to like the strategy that we have in Europe, and that is to focus on key customer sets, key channels with key products that we have and maintain our capability there. If there are opportunities that come up, we'll look at them. But they have to be very consistent with our strategy. In terms of acquisitions overall, we continue to see a very interesting pipeline.

We continue, as Vern said, to see a very robust opportunity for acquisitions. Our focus is in 2 primary areas: technology. And there, we continue to see opportunities not only to acquire, but to make investments in, minority or larger investments in; or to partner; or lastly, to just have a commercial relationship to share technology on a licensing-type arrangement. So we do see a lot of opportunities there and continue to be very active in pursuing opportunities to expand our capability in technology. The other area is in bolt-on, tuck-in-type acquisitions both for our luminaire business as well as our control building management business. There, too, we're seeing a robust pipeline. Obviously, Juno is a great example of bolt-on, tuck-in-type acquisitions that fills gaps that we have. There, we'll more likely, obviously, look to acquire as opposed to invest in. But we do see a robust pipeline, and I think it's likely in both of those areas to continue to see us be active where it supports our strategic focus and creates value at a reasonable price."

In my prepared remarks, I said that Tier 3 solutions through the first 3 months, and again, it's coming off of a smaller base and our measuring capabilities in the prior periods weren't as robust as they are today, but we guesstimate that Tier 3 portion of our business, which now represents almost 10% of our business, grew at approximately a 40% growth rate. When we think about how we have invested in our tiered solutions strategy, I mean, our headcount, including acquisitions this year, is probably up in the salary headcount area close to 30%. And while we don't specifically allocate all capabilities by tiers because of the way products can work and migrate through the tiers and support the tiers, it's not really an effective use to allocate. But what I can say is that when we look at things specific to our tiered solutions strategy, like our ability to develop software, whether it be firmware that makes our entire Tier 3 solution work well between various control components, Distech, of course, and our lighting business, that group has expanded by a factor of 4. We probably had 18 months ago less than 20 folks in this group. Today, we have over -- well, we're approaching 80 folks and by the end of the year we'll probably have close to 100 on our way, probably 250 people. And it's really because of the opportunities that we see in supporting the Tier 3, Tier 4 solution set. We are very pleased to announce that Target selected us as their exclusive smart lighting solutions provider. The opportunity to provide them not only with lighting solutions that enhance energy efficiency, but to provide them with other opportunities to do things is really an example of how we're -- not moving but investing in and growing our Tier 3 solutions strategy. So more to come. We're in the very early innings of this game, and we're very excited about the potential of what this tiered solutions strategy will afford for you as shareholders and for our customers as a solution set."

I think what's more interesting than trying to put a numerical number around it -- and it's not just Target, it's the whole notion of how the installed base not just in retail but when you think about other very large building owners, whether it's campuses or universities or research centers, these large installed bases, the opportunity to convert them from traditional lighting to smart lighting solutions really is not only for energy savings, but daylight harvesting, the ability to make the visual space better, more effective, the opportunity to participate in the Internet of Things as data collection points, that's what we find really fascinating. So our relationship with Target is a decades-old long relationship. They're a great customer. And we dedicate significant resources to making sure that we are meeting their needs at every step. So it's an example of our access to market and then bringing these solution sets to the market that are allowing us to drive Tier 3. So when I think about the total market, DOE says that there's 100 billion square feet of building space that is in the U.S., 70% of which was put in place before 1990. So a few years ago, we estimated that the -- to convert that installed base might have been about $3 a square foot for lighting and controls. Today, we believe that number is much higher because of the true value add that can be brought through smart lighting. And the Target situation is just an example, and there are many, many, many more. So without focusing too much on Target but focusing more on what Target represents as a leader in the retail space and taking a leadership position to make the conversion to smart lighting, I think that's what's really interesting. And then how that expands and extends to other folks that are different subsets of the retail market which, as you know, is huge, so that they can take advantage of smart lighting, that's the potential. I think that the market that's out there, that installed base is enormous in size and represents an enormous opportunity for Acuity as we go forward."

It's really a shame because those -- that old technology, those old solutions that people are saying, ""well, I have that too,"" it's really not the same. And as people become more comfortable and understand the solution set, what Acuity offers is really huge. The introduction of nLight eclipse, for example, is just another example of a Tier 3 solution set that allows us to get after building owners, not just retailers but all building owners, in a way that allows us to optimize their lighting, while driving great unification between the HVAC systems, submetering, security and lighting and allowing us to do this in a very, very clever and simple way.

We will continue to direct investment and continue to drive productivity in our business, and I'll consider this a productivity opportunity, where we can continue to invest. This quarter, we delivered on the legacy business about 30% variable contribution. So it's higher than what we kind of have been targeting into that mid- to upper 20s. So we're always looking to optimize in the short term what we're doing in terms of variable contribution margin so we can drive our result, but we're doing that against the backdrop of long-term investment opportunities. And for us, mostly that's human capital. We're spending right now in CapEx about 2.5% of sales, a little bit higher than what we normally do, but we're still investing at a very rapid pace in our human talent. As I mentioned earlier, including acquisitions, our salary headcount is up about 30%. But interestingly, our SDA as a percentage of total sales, we picked up about 10 bps. So we're looking to leverage our base while investing. So to say precisely that all of those savings are going to enhance variable contribution, we're looking at balancing off both investing for the short term as well as driving -- excuse me, investing for the longer term while investing or delivering shorter term as well."

And I would see that over time, it may even tilt more because the installed base is so enormous. And the opportunity there is to provide value and solution sets to end customers where there is no alternative. They're not building something. They're not renovating. So we call that unplanned renovation. But it's because the payback and the opportunity of the new solution set is so compelling that they want to make that unplanned renovation. I would say new construction, it continues to move along at a solid but yet somewhat of a -- almost a schizophrenic pace. We see spurts and then we see declines. We see spurts and decline. And that has to do with the entire geography. Because we serve so many different markets, it's difficult to discern an absolute trend. There is no doubt that when we went through here over the last 18 months changes in oil prices, that some of the activities in those oil patch areas slowed down a little. But yet in other areas, technology, we see those markets continuing to expand. So I feel, generally speaking, that as employment continues to improve, we're seeing broad-based improvement in commercial office buildings. We're seeing improvements in health care as budgets of states continue to improve. We're seeing spending in education both K-12 as well as higher education. The industrial segment continues to move along nicely. Roadway seems to be moving along quite nicely. So I think, all in all, we're continuing to see improvement on a gradual basis, but it's the renovation market that allows us to continue to drive our growth in a solid way. Europe, we'll wait and see what happens there. Obviously, that uncertainty is out there. But I don't feel like the contagion of anything that may go on there will spill over here. Just to reiterate, 97% of our revenues are generated here. We have a great business in the U.K. and in Spain. Obviously, U.K.'s products just got a heck of a lot cheaper for people to now acquire them in Mainland Europe. So we continue to be bullish on the overall opportunities for Acuity."

So when you move -- or remove that and you look at people who are selling software control solutions, Distech has -- while it's a smaller business, it has a very strong reputation for being innovative, using technology and it has a reasonable market share. And so the opportunity for us to work with and have 2 channels, their traditional channel system integrators and our traditional channels of local agents work together to sell these solution sets that really provide a great deal of value for really all buildings of all types and really explain why using our now unified system, which we're very excited about -- and it's software, it took a lot of time to develop, a lot of hard work. But the nLight eclipse system will be the backbone in terms of creating a very, very simple, single piece of glass for building users to now manage the affairs of their building in a much more simple and effective way. So we're very excited about the possibilities and the opportunities of that. Because its applicability -- again, think of education campuses of any type, commercial office buildings, health care facility, and you can just keep going on, buildings of any type are really the opportunity here. And given the connectivity that we have through contractors, engineers, lighting designers and they through system integrators and then their own form of contractors, this will allow us to sell those value propositions and the ease of installation, the ease of programming is really going to be a point of key differentiation. And then the end user has, again, very, very simple tools -- or simple to use but massive tools that are available to help drive the effectiveness of their building."

And there's a little bit of lag on when that gets in pricing that I think impacted that. Those kinds of cost reductions in commodities such as steel, aluminum, copper do get passed on pretty quickly in our industry. Now as many of you know, steel has taken a quick V turn, not even a U turn, a V turn based on the tariffs that have been imposed on steel to where we've seen steel rise 35-something percent here in the last few months. So I -- it'll be interesting to see how quick the market reacts to passing that on. Historically, they've been -- the industry has passed that on. But I would say it's still predominantly due to passing on reduction in our input costs, predominantly LED. But we have seen some reduction in others that have caused that number to round to 2% instead of the 1%."

And we don't have specific dates. But my two cents is that based on the question that we had earlier, the activity and the interest level is increasing at a very high rate. And our ability to position ourselves and have dialogue with these very same customers is robust. And retailers are very, very focused on the quality of light in their store. They're very focused on energy savings. They're very focused on these types of things. So the transition from conventional fluorescent lighting into LED, while it's very interesting, they're doing it because they see multiple opportunities around it. I mentioned Target only by way of example. And when you think about the installed base, I want to keep bringing us back to that, it is so enormous in terms of the potential for conversion that this is where our excitement is. It's not -- for the investing public, you guys have said, well, give us some evidence that the Tier 3 solution set or strategy could work. Our growth there has been quite significant as a percentage of our sales. It's now becoming significant. This was a customer that made a move. It's just -- it's a continuation of the march towards the huge opportunity that's out there. So you're right, I'm not going to mention other names. But what I want to make sure investors understand is that the opportunity through all of these verticals is quite enormous. And so we're looking at all those verticals. And we're attacking them as we have with vigor. And we're selling the solution sets, we believe, that we have great sales forces that know how to sell these types of solution sets. So it gives us a leg up in making sure that we're first. And I would expect us to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve because of these types of opportunities. Again, the installed base is enormous. It's much larger. It could be substantially larger than what new construction represents for a long time to come because of its size and its scale. So that's where I'd like to direct your attention and your focus. If you look at what our growth rates have been over the last 13 quarters, double-digit growth rates, we've outperformed the growth rates of the markets we serve. We're doing a good job bringing the margin to bear. People have asked us about margins you have in Tier 3. Just a quick comment, if I look back over the last 3 years where we've been implementing this tiered strategy approach, we've picked up close to 400 basis points on our gross profit margin and almost 500 basis points on our operating profit margin during that time period. So while lots of things are happening to improve our business, as we migrate and as we expand, that's probably a better word, in our Tier 3 solutions strategy, you're seeing how it's influencing in a favorable way our margin impact and while we're investing. I mean, this has been a continuous comment that we've made. We're investing today because we see the opportunity tomorrow. We started that a while back, and you're seeing the return and the benefit off of that. Our cash flow return on investment is still is in the low 30 percentile, which is -- puts us in the 90 bp percentile in terms of performance capabilities there. But I think we're doing all of this right."

We -- just simply because pricing of componentry comes down, as Ricky pointed out earlier, it can find its way back into the market. We deal in a bid world, but we're all trying to differentiate or at least Acuity is trying to differentiate its features and benefits relative to the price. And I think we have been successful in convincing our customers of the true value of the solution set that we bring. Again, when we're up against competitors that are bringing battery-powered beacons to the marketplace, that's old news. People who are installing that type of technology are making a huge mistake. It's almost irresponsible of them -- for them to do that. The fact of the matter is, is that Acuity continues to drive that productivity, drive the change in its value propositions so that it can continue to extract the value of our gross profit margin, if you will, for that value. I expect that trend to continue. We tend to look at gross profit over annual periods, not quarterly periods. I know that you all have to look at everything on a quarterly basis. But I think if you look at that type of thing over an annual basis, you'll see that continuous improvement in our business is allowing us to improve margins. Volume, as that increases, we're able to extract that variable contribution; mix, as we continue to grow Tier 3. But let's be clear, Tier 1 and Tier 2 are critically important and we do well there as well in terms of margin profile. But there's no doubt that Tier 3 and Tier 4 have gross profit margin dynamics that are accretive to what we're doing today. So we would expect to see that trend continue. The pricing, as Ricky pointed out earlier, on component costs, it's ebbing and flowing. It's something that we've always had to manage. What's more important about it is if you can continue to have improvements, even incremental improvements in technology. And that goes back into the fluorescent world. Just imagine when it went from T-12 to T-8 to T-5, same scenario. So simply because it's an LED light source, it hasn't really changed how we think about the internal workings of our business and how we compete in the marketplace. We're always trying to sell value with new technology. LED is an enabler for us to selling more value, i.e. Internet of Things, combined solution sets for energy savings. That's how we're driving the value, and I expect the trend to continue."

I can only comment on our outdoor business, and that continues to grow at a very nice pace. So we're actually gaining share nicely there. We're -- our growth rates are exceeding the overall growth rates of the market. The reason for the penetration in outdoor is it's a total cost of ownership-type thing, the whole notion of whether it's an industrial outdoor or whether it's a street or roadway, these luminaires are very expensive to have to change light bulbs and maintain. So LED is a perfect opportunity to effect great value there. So the penetration rate of outdoor makes complete sense to me, and I expect that to continue. But let me remind everyone, it's still only 20%. There's another 80% that's out there, and that 80% market continues to -- by itself, just in outdoor, to be an enormous market by itself. In other areas of the business, we are very excited about the introduction of nLight eclipse and other components off of that, the ability to -- we'll have some more comments on this later. The ability to separate meter, we believe, is going to allow Acuity with this lighting solution, this building automation solution set to get after that commercial office market, the installed base, which is converted very, very slowly, primarily because most commercial buildings are socialized utilities. So it's hard to actually get down to what are you consuming in terms of energy. You just pay it based on square footage. So we're very excited about the potential of converting that type of market as we go forward. Ricky, other end markets? I would say we see, again, continued opportunities for further penetration. I think that the notion of what retail is doing, retail is looking at not just energy savings, but what more can occur there, that's a big space."

If you've upgraded to high-output T-8 or T-5, that's still a very energy-efficient light source, so the conversion is slower. But you're now seeing LED pulling away from the lumens per watt in the capability of fluorescent, so I do think it will accelerate there. We're very well penetrated in that indoor space and would expect to fully participate as that conversion accelerates. Where it's been the fastest to date is more where you've had energy sources that were less energy efficient, incandescent, high pressure sodium HID that had issues not just energy, but slow to come on, hard to control, those type of things that are driving this conversion."

First off, our results for the third quarter of 2016 were outstanding. Our net sales grew 25% while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 40%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics, including net sales and gross profit margin; and on an adjusted basis, operating profit and diluted earnings per share. In fact, this was our 13th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit value growth, a remarkable achievement. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence our strategies to provide customers with differentiated, value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position.
These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting and building automation solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity gain. Our results for the third quarter set records for Acuity even as we continued to invest in our strong sales growth in areas with significant growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solution. I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call. But I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.
Net sales for the third quarter were $852 million, an increase of 25% compared to the year-ago period and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $121 million compared with reported operating profit of $99.2 million in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special charges, which Ricky will describe later in the call. Also, our reported operating profit included items such as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles.
In order to make our results comparable between periods, we find it helpful to add back these items to our reported results. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $146.1 million compared with an adjusted operating profit of $108.1 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 35%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 17.2%, up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.06 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.47 in the year-ago period, up 40%. This is compelling performance.
We closed the quarter with $337 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million for acquisitions this year, leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further, we generated a record $244 million from net cash provided by operations in the first 3 quarters of 2016, up $86 million or 54% from the year-ago period. Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis.
Net sales for the third quarter grew 25% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales value grew by an impressive 16%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points while changes in price/mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on light-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain component costs and, to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels.
Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for approximately 60% of our total net sales which, as you know, includes the sale of nonfixture-related products and solutions as well.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted third quarter operating profit was $146.1 million, the most in our history; and adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a quarterly record of 17.2%, up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 44.5%, up 130 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past has had a lower gross profit margin than Acuity.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustment items noted earlier for each quarter, were up $45.2 million or 24%. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.3% in the current quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisitions and, to a lesser degree, higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy.
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our third quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisition. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 30%, well above our current target of mid to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
On the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our Lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls as well as our building automation platform.
With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT application.
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy. For example, our innovative LED solutions earned multiple awards from the industry's most prestigious programs during LIGHTFAIR International, including the 2016 LFI Innovation Awards and the Next Generation Luminaires Solid-State Lighting Design indoor competition.
Additionally, we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consists of 4 tiers. The purpose of this strategy is to lever our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device, which we categorize as Tier 1; or complete holistic, integrated lighting and building automation solutions, which we refer to as Tier 3 for the indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for our customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri and Juno have meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales dated for our tiered solutions are still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales of our Tier 3 category, encompassing our holistic integrated solutions, were up approximately 40% through the first 3 quarters of this year over the year-ago period and now represent almost 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solution. To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' application.
We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salary headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy. Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits, including energy savings, and the opportunity to have a smart, connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application and with the addition of Distech controls, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Over the last 12 months, we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including Target and 2 other global leading retailers, to smart lighting solution. As part of their smart lighting solution, we currently have almost 200,000 maintenance-free, beacon-enabled LED lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful, actionable information. We believe this level of capability in deployment is unmatched in our industry. Importantly, we expect this installed base to quadruple by the end of 2016. Further, Target selected Acuity as its exclusive smart lighting solutions provider. 
The integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a stand-alone company, is moving along very well. We expect the combination of Acuity with its broad industry-leading, solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solution and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic, unified solutions that deliver true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reduction as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
In fact, we just introduced nLight eclipse, a powerful, cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solution that unifies lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines building programming, facilitates our smart multi-zone daylight harvesting and color-tuning capabilities and enhances IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease of installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is driving the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. 
We expect these recent strategic acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation as we further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because we -- of the dedication and resolve of our now 10,000 associates. We are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.
I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2016. Ricky?"
1413208,347040280,1003503,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 29, 2016",2016-06-29,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone.

As Vern noted, we had a strong third quarter performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll provide a bit more color on our record third quarter results and our financial position. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we added back $1 million or $0.02 per diluted share for various acquisition-related items, $7.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets, $6.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share for share-based compensation expense and $9.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share for special charges related to streamlining activities, including integration of recent acquisitions and consolidation of certain production activities.
We adjusted prior year results for amortizations of acquired intangible assets of $2.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, share-based compensation expense of $4.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share, acquisition-related items of $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share and special charge of $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share. In addition, we adjusted prior year results for the gain on financial instruments used to hedge the Distech Canadian dollar purchase price of $10.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.06 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which is a 40% increase compared with $1.47 adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago period. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations.
We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. In addition, many of our peer companies make these same adjustments in order to help you as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $9.7 million for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities include the consolidations of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. We expect to achieve net annual savings of at least twice the amount of the special charge commencing at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with these and potential future integration and streamlining activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared with 36% in the third quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
Cash flow generated from operations for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2016 was an impressive $243.9 million, an increase of $85.7 million or 54% compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job this quarter of managing operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital, net of the effect of acquisitions, decreased by 1 day compared with last year to 41 days, which we believe is industry leading.
In the first 9 months of fiscal year 2016, we spent $61.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $42.3 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronic capacity and building out of our innovation and technology center in metro Atlanta, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016.
At May 31, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $337 million, a decrease of $419.8 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily for cash used to fund acquisitions of $613.7 million and capital expenditures of $61.8 million as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $17.1 million. Our total debt outstanding was $354.4 million at May 31, 2016. The ratio of debt net of cash to total capitalization net of cash was 1.1% at May 31, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at May 31, 2016, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,347040280,1003503,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 29, 2016",2016-06-29,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity.

As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Last week's U.K. referendum vote to exit [ph] the European Union has created a great deal of uncertainty and generated significant volatility in the global financial markets over concerns regarding the potential impact, if any, on the global economy. This uncertainty and volatility have the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which could negatively impact global economic activity. This notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observation.
First, the consensus estimate from independent third-party forecasters calls for the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales, to grow to mid- to upper single-digit range through fiscal 2016, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the favorable trend in our June order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve and our business. Leading indicators for the North American markets such as Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely.
Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, and steel costs, which have risen recently, we do not anticipate significant changes in most input costs over the next 12 months. We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs.
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly during this period of uncertainty caused by the U.K. announcement last week.
Another observation: While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation, price, product and sale channel mix as well as current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as volumes grow and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to the integration of recent acquisition. Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a positive picture.
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.
Lastly and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that, for example, connect smart lighting with smartphones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our key customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base by the end of 2016.
As we have noted in the last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3 and the implementation of our IoT solution.
Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels.
As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we experienced some modest short-term impact on their net sales as we integrated certain overlapping sales forces. We are pleased to report the integration of those sales forces has been substantially completed and early indicators, such as quote rates for Juno products, are up significantly over the year-ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us.
Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast-growing business intelligence company, will enhance our expanding business analytics capability as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users' need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity. Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength and capitalize on the market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior return. It all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity.
Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and, more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient solutions, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries. 
Thank you. And with that, we'll entertain any questions that you have."

We have a very strong brand in both industrial and roadway as well as other types of indoor capabilities. So we will continue to drive our productivity, our focus in those markets with those products. We focus on U.K., we focus on Germany and Northern Europe. We have a capability in Spain. And my sense is, is that while there's a great deal of uncertainty going on right now, which could have some impact on our order rate, we still think it's a bullish opportunity because of what certain markets in certain countries are doing in terms of their industrial output. So while Europe represents -- or sales outside of North America represent really only 3% of our total, we continue to like the strategy that we have in Europe, and that is to focus on key customer sets, key channels with key products that we have and maintain our capability there. If there are opportunities that come up, we'll look at them. But they have to be very consistent with our strategy. In terms of acquisitions overall, we continue to see a very interesting pipeline.

We continue, as Vern said, to see a very robust opportunity for acquisitions. Our focus is in 2 primary areas: technology. And there, we continue to see opportunities not only to acquire, but to make investments in, minority or larger investments in; or to partner; or lastly, to just have a commercial relationship to share technology on a licensing-type arrangement. So we do see a lot of opportunities there and continue to be very active in pursuing opportunities to expand our capability in technology. The other area is in bolt-on, tuck-in-type acquisitions both for our luminaire business as well as our control building management business. There, too, we're seeing a robust pipeline. Obviously, Juno is a great example of bolt-on, tuck-in-type acquisitions that fills gaps that we have. There, we'll more likely, obviously, look to acquire as opposed to invest in. But we do see a robust pipeline, and I think it's likely in both of those areas to continue to see us be active where it supports our strategic focus and creates value at a reasonable price."

When we think about how we have invested in our tiered solutions strategy, I mean, our headcount, including acquisitions this year, is probably up in the salary headcount area close to 30%. And while we don't specifically allocate all capabilities by tiers because of the way products can work and migrate through the tiers and support the tiers, it's not really an effective use to allocate. But what I can say is that when we look at things specific to our tiered solutions strategy, like our ability to develop software, whether it be firmware that makes our entire Tier 3 solution work well between various control components, Distech, of course, and our lighting business, that group has expanded by a factor of 4. We probably had 18 months ago less than 20 folks in this group. Today, we have over -- well, we're approaching 80 folks and by the end of the year we'll probably have close to 100 on our way, probably 250 people. And it's really because of the opportunities that we see in supporting the Tier 3, Tier 4 solution set. We are very pleased to announce that Target selected us as their exclusive smart lighting solutions provider. The opportunity to provide them not only with lighting solutions that enhance energy efficiency, but to provide them with other opportunities to do things is really an example of how we're -- not moving but investing in and growing our Tier 3 solutions strategy.

I think what's more interesting than trying to put a numerical number around it -- and it's not just Target, it's the whole notion of how the installed base not just in retail but when you think about other very large building owners, whether it's campuses or universities or research centers, these large installed bases, the opportunity to convert them from traditional lighting to smart lighting solutions really is not only for energy savings, but daylight harvesting, the ability to make the visual space better, more effective, the opportunity to participate in the Internet of Things as data collection points, that's what we find really fascinating. So our relationship with Target is a decades-old long relationship. They're a great customer. And we dedicate significant resources to making sure that we are meeting their needs at every step. So it's an example of our access to market and then bringing these solution sets to the market that are allowing us to drive Tier 3. So when I think about the total market, DOE says that there's 100 billion square feet of building space that is in the U.S., 70% of which was put in place before 1990. So a few years ago, we estimated that the -- to convert that installed base might have been about $3 a square foot for lighting and controls. Today, we believe that number is much higher because of the true value add that can be brought through smart lighting. And the Target situation is just an example, and there are many, many, many more. So without focusing too much on Target but focusing more on what Target represents as a leader in the retail space and taking a leadership position to make the conversion to smart lighting, I think that's what's really interesting. And then how that expands and extends to other folks that are different subsets of the retail market which, as you know, is huge, so that they can take advantage of smart lighting, that's the potential. I think that the market that's out there, that installed base is enormous in size and represents an enormous opportunity for Acuity as we go forward."

The introduction of nLight eclipse, for example, is just another example of a Tier 3 solution set that allows us to get after building owners, not just retailers but all building owners, in a way that allows us to optimize their lighting, while driving great unification between the HVAC systems, submetering, security and lighting and allowing us to do this in a very, very clever and simple way.

And some of those are difficult decisions of what we're not going to do because there's still some market that we see so much potential in, again, Tier 3 and Tier 4 and what it can mean for that installed base. We will continue to direct investment and continue to drive productivity in our business, and I'll consider this a productivity opportunity, where we can continue to invest. This quarter, we delivered on the legacy business about 30% variable contribution. So it's higher than what we kind of have been targeting into that mid- to upper 20s. So we're always looking to optimize in the short term what we're doing in terms of variable contribution margin so we can drive our result, but we're doing that against the backdrop of long-term investment opportunities. And for us, mostly that's human capital. We're spending right now in CapEx about 2.5% of sales, a little bit higher than what we normally do, but we're still investing at a very rapid pace in our human talent. As I mentioned earlier, including acquisitions, our salary headcount is up about 30%. But interestingly, our SDA as a percentage of total sales, we picked up about 10 bps. So we're looking to leverage our base while investing. So to say precisely that all of those savings are going to enhance variable contribution, we're looking at balancing off both investing for the short term as well as driving -- excuse me, investing for the longer term while investing or delivering shorter term as well."

Overall, we believe that our mix of business is tilted -- we guesstimate it's 50% renovation, 50% new construction. It's probably tilting a little bit more towards renovation. And I would see that over time, it may even tilt more because the installed base is so enormous. And the opportunity there is to provide value and solution sets to end customers where there is no alternative. They're not building something. They're not renovating. So we call that unplanned renovation. But it's because the payback and the opportunity of the new solution set is so compelling that they want to make that unplanned renovation. I would say new construction, it continues to move along at a solid but yet somewhat of a -- almost a schizophrenic pace. We see spurts and then we see declines. We see spurts and decline. And that has to do with the entire geography. Because we serve so many different markets, it's difficult to discern an absolute trend. There is no doubt that when we went through here over the last 18 months changes in oil prices, that some of the activities in those oil patch areas slowed down a little. But yet in other areas, technology, we see those markets continuing to expand. So I feel, generally speaking, that as employment continues to improve, we're seeing broad-based improvement in commercial office buildings. We're seeing improvements in health care as budgets of states continue to improve. We're seeing spending in education both K-12 as well as higher education. The industrial segment continues to move along nicely. Roadway seems to be moving along quite nicely. So I think, all in all, we're continuing to see improvement on a gradual basis, but it's the renovation market that allows us to continue to drive our growth in a solid way. Europe, we'll wait and see what happens there. Obviously, that uncertainty is out there. But I don't feel like the contagion of anything that may go on there will spill over here. Just to reiterate, 97% of our revenues are generated here. We have a great business in the U.K. and in Spain. Obviously, U.K.'s products just got a heck of a lot cheaper for people to now acquire them in Mainland Europe. So we continue to be bullish on the overall opportunities for Acuity."

So when you move -- or remove that and you look at people who are selling software control solutions, Distech has -- while it's a smaller business, it has a very strong reputation for being innovative, using technology and it has a reasonable market share. And so the opportunity for us to work with and have 2 channels, their traditional channel system integrators and our traditional channels of local agents work together to sell these solution sets that really provide a great deal of value for really all buildings of all types and really explain why using our now unified system, which we're very excited about -- and it's software, it took a lot of time to develop, a lot of hard work. But the nLight eclipse system will be the backbone in terms of creating a very, very simple, single piece of glass for building users to now manage the affairs of their building in a much more simple and effective way. So we're very excited about the possibilities and the opportunities of that. Because its applicability -- again, think of education campuses of any type, commercial office buildings, health care facility, and you can just keep going on, buildings of any type are really the opportunity here. And given the connectivity that we have through contractors, engineers, lighting designers and they through system integrators and then their own form of contractors, this will allow us to sell those value propositions and the ease of installation, the ease of programming is really going to be a point of key differentiation. And then the end user has, again, very, very simple tools -- or simple to use but massive tools that are available to help drive the effectiveness of their building."

And there's a little bit of lag on when that gets in pricing that I think impacted that. Those kinds of cost reductions in commodities such as steel, aluminum, copper do get passed on pretty quickly in our industry. Now as many of you know, steel has taken a quick V turn, not even a U turn, a V turn based on the tariffs that have been imposed on steel to where we've seen steel rise 35-something percent here in the last few months. So I -- it'll be interesting to see how quick the market reacts to passing that on. Historically, they've been -- the industry has passed that on. But I would say it's still predominantly due to passing on reduction in our input costs, predominantly LED. But we have seen some reduction in others that have caused that number to round to 2% instead of the 1%."

And we don't have specific dates. But my two cents is that based on the question that we had earlier, the activity and the interest level is increasing at a very high rate. And our ability to position ourselves and have dialogue with these very same customers is robust. And retailers are very, very focused on the quality of light in their store. They're very focused on energy savings. They're very focused on these types of things. So the transition from conventional fluorescent lighting into LED, while it's very interesting, they're doing it because they see multiple opportunities around it. I mentioned Target only by way of example. And when you think about the installed base, I want to keep bringing us back to that, it is so enormous in terms of the potential for conversion that this is where our excitement is. It's not -- for the investing public, you guys have said, well, give us some evidence that the Tier 3 solution set or strategy could work. Our growth there has been quite significant as a percentage of our sales. It's now becoming significant. This was a customer that made a move. It's just -- it's a continuation of the march towards the huge opportunity that's out there. So you're right, I'm not going to mention other names. But what I want to make sure investors understand is that the opportunity through all of these verticals is quite enormous. And so we're looking at all those verticals. And we're attacking them as we have with vigor. And we're selling the solution sets, we believe, that we have great sales forces that know how to sell these types of solution sets. So it gives us a leg up in making sure that we're first. And I would expect us to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve because of these types of opportunities. Again, the installed base is enormous. It's much larger. It could be substantially larger than what new construction represents for a long time to come because of its size and its scale. So that's where I'd like to direct your attention and your focus. If you look at what our growth rates have been over the last 13 quarters, double-digit growth rates, we've outperformed the growth rates of the markets we serve. We're doing a good job bringing the margin to bear. People have asked us about margins you have in Tier 3. Just a quick comment, if I look back over the last 3 years where we've been implementing this tiered strategy approach, we've picked up close to 400 basis points on our gross profit margin and almost 500 basis points on our operating profit margin during that time period. So while lots of things are happening to improve our business, as we migrate and as we expand, that's probably a better word, in our Tier 3 solutions strategy, you're seeing how it's influencing in a favorable way our margin impact and while we're investing. I mean, this has been a continuous comment that we've made. We're investing today because we see the opportunity tomorrow. We started that a while back, and you're seeing the return and the benefit off of that. Our cash flow return on investment is still is in the low 30 percentile, which is -- puts us in the 90 bp percentile in terms of performance capabilities there. But I think we're doing all of this right."

We -- just simply because pricing of componentry comes down, as Ricky pointed out earlier, it can find its way back into the market. We deal in a bid world, but we're all trying to differentiate or at least Acuity is trying to differentiate its features and benefits relative to the price. And I think we have been successful in convincing our customers of the true value of the solution set that we bring. Again, when we're up against competitors that are bringing battery-powered beacons to the marketplace, that's old news. People who are installing that type of technology are making a huge mistake. It's almost irresponsible of them -- for them to do that. The fact of the matter is, is that Acuity continues to drive that productivity, drive the change in its value propositions so that it can continue to extract the value of our gross profit margin, if you will, for that value. I expect that trend to continue. We tend to look at gross profit over annual periods, not quarterly periods. I know that you all have to look at everything on a quarterly basis. But I think if you look at that type of thing over an annual basis, you'll see that continuous improvement in our business is allowing us to improve margins. Volume, as that increases, we're able to extract that variable contribution; mix, as we continue to grow Tier 3. But let's be clear, Tier 1 and Tier 2 are critically important and we do well there as well in terms of margin profile. But there's no doubt that Tier 3 and Tier 4 have gross profit margin dynamics that are accretive to what we're doing today. So we would expect to see that trend continue. The pricing, as Ricky pointed out earlier, on component costs, it's ebbing and flowing. It's something that we've always had to manage. What's more important about it is if you can continue to have improvements, even incremental improvements in technology. And that goes back into the fluorescent world. Just imagine when it went from T-12 to T-8 to T-5, same scenario. So simply because it's an LED light source, it hasn't really changed how we think about the internal workings of our business and how we compete in the marketplace. We're always trying to sell value with new technology. LED is an enabler for us to selling more value, i.e. Internet of Things, combined solution sets for energy savings. That's how we're driving the value, and I expect the trend to continue."

I can only comment on our outdoor business, and that continues to grow at a very nice pace. So we're actually gaining share nicely there. We're -- our growth rates are exceeding the overall growth rates of the market. The reason for the penetration in outdoor is it's a total cost of ownership-type thing, the whole notion of whether it's an industrial outdoor or whether it's a street or roadway, these luminaires are very expensive to have to change light bulbs and maintain. So LED is a perfect opportunity to effect great value there. So the penetration rate of outdoor makes complete sense to me, and I expect that to continue. But let me remind everyone, it's still only 20%. There's another 80% that's out there, and that 80% market continues to -- by itself, just in outdoor, to be an enormous market by itself. In other areas of the business, we are very excited about the introduction of nLight eclipse and other components off of that, the ability to -- we'll have some more comments on this later. The ability to separate meter, we believe, is going to allow Acuity with this lighting solution, this building automation solution set to get after that commercial office market, the installed base, which is converted very, very slowly, primarily because most commercial buildings are socialized utilities. So it's hard to actually get down to what are you consuming in terms of energy. You just pay it based on square footage. So we're very excited about the potential of converting that type of market as we go forward. Ricky, other end markets? I would say we see, again, continued opportunities for further penetration. I think that the notion of what retail is doing, retail is looking at not just energy savings, but what more can occur there, that's a big space."

If you've upgraded to high-output T-8 or T-5, that's still a very energy-efficient light source, so the conversion is slower. But you're now seeing LED pulling away from the lumens per watt in the capability of fluorescent, so I do think it will accelerate there. We're very well penetrated in that indoor space and would expect to fully participate as that conversion accelerates. Where it's been the fastest to date is more where you've had energy sources that were less energy efficient, incandescent, high pressure sodium HID that had issues not just energy, but slow to come on, hard to control, those type of things that are driving this conversion."

First, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in 2016. We achieved record results for virtually all financial metrics, including net sales, operating profit, diluted earnings per share and cash flow generation. For the full year and the fourth quarter, net sales grew approximately 22%; while sales volume, excluding acquisitions, was more than double the estimated mid-single-digit growth rates of the key markets we serve. In fact, this was the 14th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement that few companies can claim.

These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative energy-efficient lighting and building management solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and companywide productivity. 
We achieved record profitability for the quarter and full year, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting and building management solutions portfolio, which affords us a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things. 
I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights.  First, for the quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a quarterly record of $926 million, an increase of 22% compared with the year-ago period. Our net sales could have been even higher, as I will explain later in the call.  Reported operating profit was $135.1 million compared with $111.8 million in the year-ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.89, a quarterly record compared with the $1.37 in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for us an special items which Ricky will explain later in the call. 
Also our reported financial results included certain items, among others such as stock-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles. Because many shareholders and analysts ask specific questions regarding these items, in order to make our results comparable between periods, we will continue to add back these items to our reported results to provide greater transparency and comparability. 
In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $156.5 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $123.6 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 27%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.9%, an increase of 60 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.21, up 27% from the year-ago period against strong quarterly results.
For the full year, net sales at Acuity were a record $3.3 billion, up 22% from 2015. Reported operating profit was $475 million in 2016 compared with $376 million in the year-ago period, while diluted earnings per share was $6.63, up 30% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit was $555 million in 2016, up 32% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was a record 16.9%, up 130 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $7.84, up almost 35% in 2015. 
In addition, we generated a record $346 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year, up 20% from last year. We closed the year with $413 million of cash on hand, even after investing $623 million for acquisitions as well as $84 million in capital expenditures this year, leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our growth strategies. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital. Our adjusted cash flow return on investment for 2016 was 34%, tying our all-time high even after the significant investments made this year. We believe this level of return is far in excess of others in the electrical industry. For those who follow EVA, we generated over $150 million in positive EVA, outstanding achievement.
To put our performance in perspective, I'd like to remind folks of 2 points. First, the nonresidential construction market, an important market for us, is still down about 15% on an inflation-adjusted basis from its peak in 2008; and yet, our net sales are up 65% since then. Second, we sold virtually no LED-based fixtures in 2008, and today, these solutions make up almost 2/3 of our net sales. We have invested significant significantly to make Acuity the leader in digital lighting, while at the same time delivering superior financial performance for our shareholders. 
While our record results for the quarter and the full year were significant improvements over the year-ago periods, they could have been even better. We would like to provide you with more color in our results for the quarter and the year.  
Net sales and profitability for the fourth quarter were all-time quarterly records. However, as I said, our results could have been even greater and here's why.  During the quarter we made the decision to accelerate certain actions to streamline our supply chain, enhance our customer service and drive productivity. These actions included, among others, the closure of a manufacturing location and the transfer of certain production to alternate locations in order to free up additional capacity for future growth and to better leverage our overall supply chain. These actions overlap with the ramping up of the new production facility and the addition of a new line. The combination of these actions created labor shortages in certain locations, which negatively impacted production and shipments, which resulted in canceled orders as well as added costs. We estimate these short-term labor issues resulted in canceled orders and lost contribution and more than $25 million of net sales and caused us to incur additional overtime and other costs in excess of $2 million in the quarter. We're not going to attempt to quantify the impact of these labor shortages had on our fourth quarter results beyond what I just noted just now. Please know the actions implemented this quarter will provide significant benefits to our business as we go forward. While the impact of these labor issues is mostly behind us, we may experience some modest carryover effect into our first quarter, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results.
Looking more closely on the fourth quarter, net sales grew 22% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew an impressive 13%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points, while changes in price/mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing in LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain component costs and to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based in most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for almost 2/3 of our total net sales and as you know, includes the sale of nonfixed related products and solutions as well.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions, and the strength of our sales forces, have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to commented our profitability and strategic -- accomplishments. Our profitability measures for the fourth quarter were outstanding even while absorbing the impact of the supply chain streamlining actions I noted earlier and the continued investments in areas of growth such as our unified lighting and building management platform and our IoT capabilities. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating profit was $156.5 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.9% and just shy of our quarterly record of 17.2%, but up 60 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was 43.5%, up 120 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout most of the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in the recent past had lower gross profit margins than Acuity, as well as the short-term impact of the supply chain streamlining actions taken during the quarter.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter, were up $48.1 million or 24%. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.6% in the quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of acquisitions and higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our fourth quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin. Excluding the impact of acquisitions on a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 26%, well within our current target of mid- to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
The story was much the same for the full year's record sales results -- full year record results in 2016. Net sales grew 22% this year. Excluding acquisitions, our net sales grew over 13%, while sales volume grew over 15%, more than 2x the estimated growth rate of our addressable market. Adjusted gross profit margin was a record 43.7%, up 140 basis points compared with the prior year's gross profit margin. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.9% improved 130 basis points over 2015. Our adjusted variable contribution margin for the full year, excluding acquisitions, was almost 30% even while we invested aggressively in areas which represent exciting growth opportunities. Again, we had another great year.
On the strategic front in 2016, we continued to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be a strong growth in profitability in 2017 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our Lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as our building management platform. With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls that also support building management and IoT applications. 
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy, winning accolades from customers and numerous industry awards this year for introducing solutions never seen before. In fact, Forbes Magazine recently recognized Acuity Brands in its top 100 most innovative companies list. No other lighting company or building management company made this exclusive list. This is a remarkable achievement of our extraordinary associates. And remember, this is from a company with longtime industry-leading brands, one of which has been in existence for almost 120 years.
Additionally, we continued to invest in and expand our company but capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consist of 4 tier levels. As we have noted before, the purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio of offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device which we categorize as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated lighting and building management solution, which we refer to as Tier 3, for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise in security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple, both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri, DGLogik [ph] and Juno in 2016 had meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic innovative solutions were up almost 40% this year over 2015 and now represent more than 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional recurring revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solutions.
To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organizational structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salary headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy.
In fact, our salaried headcount is up almost 30% from 1 year earlier and that includes [ph] acquisitions. Few other companies, if any, have been able to make this kind of investment while delivering upper quartile financial performance like Acuity. 
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best can control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment, while realizing additional benefits including energy and maintenance savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, and with the additions of Distech, Juno, DGLogik and Geometri, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we're not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. As I noted last quarter, we had converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including global leading retailers and certain other customers to smart lighting solutions. As part of their smart lighting solution platform, we had more than 200,000 maintenance-free beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful actionable information. Importantly, we are on a path to almost quadruple this installed base by the end of calendar 2016. We believe this level of capability in deployment is unmatched in our industry. 
integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a standalone company, continues to move along very well. We expect the combination of Distech and Acuity with our broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions, to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic, unified solutions that deliver true and optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
As an integral part of the strategy, we just introduced nlight  Eclipse, a powerful cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading controls, lighting controls, by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solutions that unifies lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines our building programming, facilitates our smart multizone daylight harvesting and color tuning capabilities and enhanced IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease of installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity  is driving the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities, and we are just getting started.
We expect our recent strategic acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now almost 12,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving and solving and supporting the needs of our customers. 
I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our market expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2017. Ricky?"
1413208,384005193,1053226,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance",793,"Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance and not repeat information already provided by Vern.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily, due to the impact of 4 acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets; share-based compensation expense since we use restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of the shareholders; special charges as we streamlined and integrated recent acquisitions; and an impairment of intangible assets as we rationalized acquired trade names. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. 
In addition, many of our peer companies, especially as we become more of a technology company, make these same adjustments, so that will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.
During the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $4.9 million and $15 million, respectively, for actions initiated to streamline the organization including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities included the consolidation of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. 
We realized net savings in excess of $4 million in fiscal year 2016 and expect to achieve annual savings of twice the amount of the special charge, or approximately $30 million, and we believe will be at this run rate by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with further integration activities of recent acquisitions in fiscal year 2017, although the amount and exact timing has not yet been determined.
During the fourth quarter, we finalized our allocation of the purchase price for the Distech acquisition and refined the preliminary allocations for Juno, Geometri and DGLogik acquisitions. Consequently, we reduced our fourth quarter acquisition-related amortization expense by $4.4 million from the amount recorded in the third quarter. We expect to finalize the remaining purchase price allocations by the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our current estimate is that acquisition-related amortization expense will be approximately $5.8 million per quarter in fiscal year 2017. To provide full transparency of this noncash cost, we will continue to quantify this amount each quarter as part of our adjusted results. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.8% compared with 35% in the fourth quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 will once again be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
We did an excellent job this year of managing operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital was 38 days, which we believe is industry leading. 
In fiscal year 2016, we spent $83.7 million on capital expenditures compared with $56.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics and painting capacity and build-outs of our innovation and technology center and a new production facility, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.
At August 31, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $413.2 million a decrease of $343.6 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease is due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $623.2 million and the capital expenditures of $83.7 million as well as the paid dividends to shareholders of $22.9 million. 
Our total debt outstanding was $355.2 million at August 31, 2016, and we had more cash than debt at the year-end. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at August 31, 2016, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and we'll continue to see the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,384005193,1053226,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe contin",1047,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe continue to move along in a measured, but sometimes inconsistent pace. This year's presidential election in the U.S. and events such as U.K.'s referendum vote to exit the European Union continued to create uncertainty and volatility. This uncertainty and volatility has the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which in turn could negatively impact global economic activity. 
That notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for the continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observations for 2017.
First, we estimate the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales, will grow in the mid- to upper single-digit range in fiscal -- or 2017, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation and retrofit activity. Again, the favorable trend in our September order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American markets such as the Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending [ph] availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline, and steel costs -- which we expect to continue to rise, we do not anticipate significant changes in other material and component costs over the next 12 months. 
We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are always unpredictable. 
Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix as well as -- the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as sales volume grows and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to recent actions taken to accelerate the integration of acquisitions made in 2016. Our record adjusted gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a very positive picture.
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as only point of differentiation. 
Lastly and most importantly, we expect our overall growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve.  
Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building management solutions that, for example, connect smart devices with smartphones for many different end users as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base of connected devices by the end of calendar 2016.
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from our acquisitions of Distech, Geometri and DGLogik, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add significantly greater broad-based holistic solutions, allowing customers to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates of our Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories as well as the implementation of our IoT solutions. 
Further, the addition of Juno has meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track [ph] lighting as well as enhancing our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. We are still in the early stages of fully optimizing the potential of Juno as part of our portfolio. 
Our companywide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength, to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. 
Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient and effective solutions. We believe this is particularly compelling as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building management industries, some of which could grow by 50% or more over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have."

We still have some work to do. We took actions this quarter that obviously impact this quarter, but we did that because we really wanted to accelerate both our growth capacity, our capacity to service the growth that we are seeing and we'll continue to see, we believe, and number two, to drive productivity so that we can continue to have the type of variable contribution margins that we expect. And what we expect, as we said before, is kind of that mid-to upper 20s. It doesn't mean that we won't exceed it from time to time, but this quarter is a great example. In spite of the challenges that we had with some of the streamlining issues, we still delivered a 26%, 27% variable contribution margin. For the full year 2016, we were about 30%. So our expectation is, is that even as we anniversary the acquisitions, we'll still be in the very high rate while continuing to invest. And just to be clear, these numbers are pretty staggering. Acuity and its legacy business in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we added 100 people. We added 100 salaried people. We're investing heavily because we see huge growth coming our way. Over the last literally year including acquisitions, we've added almost 700 salaried heads to our capabilities. This is enormous capability. In the last quarter, we added almost 1,500 hourly people. Now that number will come down a little bit as we streamline the operations, but that really was what caused us to experience labor shortages and just onboarding issues as we ramp up the business. Because again, we see very, very robust growth. All this means as we think about 2017, our expectation is to continue to deliver a very robust variable contribution margin that is in that mid-to upper 20% range, while investing in our business."

And as you might imagine, it's being more lucrative in the higher-cost areas of both coasts, East Coast as well as West Coast. Some of those have diminished a bit from the rates we've seen in previous years, but we continue to see pretty aggressive incentives being offered by the utility companies. And then there are some tax accelerated benefits as well. On the regulatory front, continue to see most of the states implementing building codes that mandate certain levels of efficiencies. Much of it is around the level of control of lights where you need to put occupancy sensors and take advantage of turning lights off when a room or a stairwell or an area's not being occupied. But as in the case of Title 24 in California, you're seeing many of them go beyond that and start mandating how much you're allowed to consume per square foot and the level of integration of the entire office power grid. So the regulatory front continues to move forward, and we see it as another catalyst for our growth."

Well, you're seeing our margins continue to improve for a number of reasons; one, incremental volume; number two, the mix as we migrate more -- migrate as a percentage of what Tier 3 and Tier 4 is de minimus right now. But ultimately, we expect it to be a nice margin contributor. Because you've invested the cost, it's almost  it's software related. So the margins that you come off of that, very consistent with other companies providing those types of capabilities. our expectation is our gross profit margin will continue to improve over time. And we will be able to continue to leverage as we hit sort of a plateauing probably sometime in late 2017, early 2018 on some of these investments. And then the revenues that will be returning off of those will make those -- the percentage of SDA become smaller relative to where it is today. We finished the year on an adjusted basis with SDA about 26.9%, let's call it 27%. Margins at of the gross profit level were about 43.7%. Again, our expectation is that our gross profit margins will continue to improve. And our SDA, we will continue to be able to leverage that. So the best way to think about our business is still in terms of variable contribution margin. we're still investing, though the investing is slowing down a tad because we have made significant investments in 2016. I would also say that when I look at our total costs for salaried associates as well as our total costs for hourly associates, as a percentage of our sales, those things continue to be flattish. And so that's why you are again seeing margins improve over the 2015 time period, whether it be in operating profit or at the gross profit level. So we are getting the leverage. It's coming through the variable contribution margin. And yet, we're still investing heavily in our business because again, we see really tremendous growth opportunity over the next decade."

The September order rate for Acuity is outperforming the industry, as we pointed out. Number two, your first question, the issue was we knew we were going to have to accelerate the consolidation of some of our manufacturing capabilities. We knew we were going to have to free up some capacity in key manufacturing facilities. So we decided during the quarter to make that investment, to accelerate those efforts. And so just sheer act of ramping up and attracting talent into the organization, [indiscernible] hourly talent, was a challenge particularly in a couple of areas because those areas are also experiencing growth from other companies moving into the market. We knew that was going to happen. We anticipated, but truthfully as we were ramping up, the whole notion of the number of -- the sheer number of folks that we needed and the training side of it resulted in us not wanting to ship product, because we wanted to make sure the quality was there and all of those issues. So we believe that we lost roughly $25 million. It's an estimate of lost orders and lost shipments during the quarter. And our guess is is, it's just a guess, that it probably cost us 70 bps of operating profit margin in total. So you can understand the magnitude, but we had to bite the bullet. We did it. We believe it's behind us. We think there maybe just some carryover lingering effect as orders ramp back up. Our order rates suggest that it's behind us. Our productive output is pretty close back to where it was in terms of our efficiencies and our effectiveness. So we're not expecting any of the lingering issues to have a material impact on our first quarter results."

And truthfully, this is why we introduced nLight Eclipse. It's a very, very powerful lighting, building, automation system that's come together in a way that is unified. So there's no steps that others have to take. You don't have to worry about whether the mechanical folks or whether the electrical folks are going to work together. And that's the beauty of the solution set, and it can enable the Internet of Things. And so we believe that more and more folks, as the specifications cycle starts its normal routine, we believe that by midyear, you're going to see orders ramping up for these things.

And so sometimes, you have to move things around to be able to do that. You hope that they always go perfectly. I think we did a good job. We just caught a little bit of a perfect storm. Some of our main facilities are in locations where the growth rate is robust because they're just great locations to be in. And so as we are ramping up the number of people I had mentioned earlier, just the whole notion of bringing people onboard, training them, facilitating all that was a challenge, but it was a temporary challenge. I think few companies have the skill and capability to do it as effectively and as efficiently as we've done. This was basically a 60-day, 90-day type issue where we've done some meaningful things that will have a huge impact on the profitability of our business going forward as well as our ability to serve customers and to expand into new markets. The Distech acquisition and its integration is moving along exceptionally well, because they continue to focus on their core businesses. engineering departments are working together in a way to introduce solution sets like nLight Eclipse. That's never existed in the market before. We are meeting an unmet need. So -- and it will take a while for those sales to ramp up as the specifications cycle works its way through, as we train people, as people become acclimated to it. But no, our appetite for acquisitions continues. While I'm disappointed that we didn't -- we lost some revenues this quarter, I just am very pleased at how aggressively we attacked these things. Because we do see robust growth not only on the lighting side, but the building management side. We see growth in the Juno product lines that they brought to us, and we see growth in the combination of Acuity and Juno. So we're very bullish about what we see on a go-forward basis."

So the investments that we have been making have really been to expand, if you will, our physical capacity in some areas because of the growth. Our electronics business is just on fire. It's doing an exceptional work, but -- So I don't see any technical obsolescence. As we think about the moves that we took in the fourth quarter, it was really about training people and bringing people onboard and then stabilizing that process. We added an enormous number of folks, as I had mentioned earlier in the call. So I think we have managed it exceedingly well. I wish we had managed it even better. Typically, we do these things and you, the shareholders, don't really see a blip. This time, it was pretty big. And so the consolidation of what we've done, we believe, will have huge benefits on a go-forward basis. So again, I don't really see much in the way of issues. It's training. It's development our people. We're good at that. It just happened very, very quickly because we made the decision to accelerate, not go slow, but go quickly. Because we believe that the growth, particularly on the installed base, renovation and retrofit activity, is huge opportunity for Acuity. We've introduced some great new products and solution sets to go after that market even more aggressively.

So it's a solution set that people would identify with. And by virtue of its features and benefits, we would hope that they would prefer that over others, and therefore, it becomes the driver of choice for many applications. As we think about Internet of Things and how we enable more folks to participate, we want people to use our driver, so that it can be part of a holistic system and their capabilities, whatever they happen to be, can participate in a solution set that an architect lighting design or a building owners would like to have, including their luminaires. I wish I could tell you we make every luminaire known to man. We don't. so our branding strategy is to get others that fill in gaps and have opportunities to participate on the overall system to be part of the digital backbone.

So Brian, the way we look at the market as we said, there's new construction. And we all know how to do that. There's an architect, lighting designer, engineer, building owner, electrical contractor, electrical distributor [indiscernible]. The next portion of the market is planned renovation. That's where someone again will hire architect, engineer, lighting designer. And they'll go after and they'll say, ""I'm going to remodel a wing of my house."" Great. That looks like new construction to us. Then there's this world of what we call unplanned renovation. It's what exists out there every day. And you use your office every day, and you don't think about the lights that are above you. It's that world that we are looking to attack in a much more aggressive and holistic way, bringing them solutions that will cause them to say, ""Yes, I want to go from having analog lighting to digital lighting. Yes I want to go from having an analog HVAC building management system to a digital building management system."" Our view is that the installed base, and I've given these statistics before, DOE estimates that there's 100 billion square feet of building space in the U.S. A few years ago, our guesstimate was that it was about $3 a square foot to convert, $2.50 a square foot for fixtures, another $0.50 a square foot of controls. We believe today that with our solution sets, the unified nLight Eclipse system, for example, the ability to enable Internet of Things to collect data off of this, to provide many more features and benefits of the data and what it can do in the space to have the building owners optimize what they're doing, is a unique and compelling value proposition. So the conversion of that installed base and the value of that installed base we think is much higher than what we had originally estimated, 2x or 3x higher. And then you put that outdoor, which is another third the size of that. It's a huge market place. DOE also estimates that less than 15% of the outdoor market has been converted to date. Less than 5% of the indoor market has converted to date. We believe that to be true. I mean, just looking all offices have down the street, and you'll see the tremendous amount of opportunity. So what Acuity is doing and what investments that we have made in ramping up not only our had done, but also the acquisitions that we've made, very strategic in nature, will give us capability to go after that installed base in a very aggressive way. It's equally applicable to new construction as well as planned renovation, but the unplanned renovation market that is huge, I mean, 800 billion or more than that. So that's what we're targeting as a growth opportunity. We continue to do well in new construction and planned renovation. see opportunities for continued growth there. We think that we're taking share in that space, but where we think we can really turbocharge our business is to get after the unplanned renovation. And that's what's gives us enthusiasm for outsized growth relative to the growth rates of the markets that we serve as well as being less dependent upon new construction by itself."

I think you said in the past it's in theory probably not likely that LED becomes the entire business mix. There's always a place for some amount of traditional lighting technologies. What do you think is the upper limit on LED mix ? [indiscernible] because it does seem like you've grown on a lot faster in that segment than expected. And so I'm just wondering how close you might be getting to what you might consider an upper limit as you see it."

So LEDs today represent almost 2/3 of our total revenues, but I just want to emphasize that Acuity has revenues other than fixture product. Obviously, Distech is a simple example, but we also sell emergency lighting. We sell poles for outdoor lighting. when we think about where our mix actually is for our lighting business -- and we sell control systems, too. It is a much higher percentage than what it means to the overall sales. So ultimately, I see Acuity sales continuing to grow in multiple areas, including selling more luminaires. But I think LED as a percentage, I don't know what the exact number will be. But it will hit a fixed percentage because it will have been converted virtually all to LED within our luminaire business. I still think that, that is a few years away, but I believe it will happen, particularly as LEDs just become more efficacious. But there are -- and they are doing that. So I think that for our business, I don't know what the exact percentage will be because we sell other things and we'll want to sell those other things. Those other items will continue to grow. I mean, our building management systems which tie, now that we have nLight Eclipse, in a unified way with HVAC and other and lighting and so on and so forth. We expect that to grow fairly significantly. So it will continue as a percentage of the total, make LEDs -- we will hold that percentage to our total. And there will always be other technologies that will come out there that will be directly LED that we will also continue to self and they'll be a small portion of our business as well."

Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. First, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in 2016. We achieved record results for virtually all financial metri",2965,"Thank you Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. 
First, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in 2016. We achieved record results for virtually all financial metrics, including net sales, operating profit, diluted earnings per share and cash flow generation. For the full year and the fourth quarter, net sales grew approximately 22%; while sales volume, excluding acquisitions, was more than double the estimated mid-single-digit growth rates of the key markets we serve. In fact, this was the 14th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement that few companies can claim. 
We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to deliver superior returns to shareholders, provide customers with differentiated value-added solutions and diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative energy-efficient lighting and building management solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and companywide productivity. 
We achieved record profitability for the quarter and full year, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting and building management solutions portfolio, which affords us a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things. 
I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights.  First, for the quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a quarterly record of $926 million, an increase of 22% compared with the year-ago period. Our net sales could have been even higher, as I will explain later in the call.  Reported operating profit was $135.1 million compared with $111.8 million in the year-ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.89, a quarterly record compared with the $1.37 in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for us an special items which Ricky will explain later in the call. 
Also our reported financial results included certain items, among others such as stock-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles. Because many shareholders and analysts ask specific questions regarding these items, in order to make our results comparable between periods, we will continue to add back these items to our reported results to provide greater transparency and comparability. 
In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $156.5 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $123.6 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 27%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.9%, an increase of 60 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.21, up 27% from the year-ago period against strong quarterly results.
For the full year, net sales at Acuity were a record $3.3 billion, up 22% from 2015. Reported operating profit was $475 million in 2016 compared with $376 million in the year-ago period, while diluted earnings per share was $6.63, up 30% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit was $555 million in 2016, up 32% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was a record 16.9%, up 130 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $7.84, up almost 35% in 2015. 
In addition, we generated a record $346 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year, up 20% from last year. We closed the year with $413 million of cash on hand, even after investing $623 million for acquisitions as well as $84 million in capital expenditures this year, leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our growth strategies. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital. Our adjusted cash flow return on investment for 2016 was 34%, tying our all-time high even after the significant investments made this year. We believe this level of return is far in excess of others in the electrical industry. For those who follow EVA, we generated over $150 million in positive EVA, outstanding achievement.
To put our performance in perspective, I'd like to remind folks of 2 points. First, the nonresidential construction market, an important market for us, is still down about 15% on an inflation-adjusted basis from its peak in 2008; and yet, our net sales are up 65% since then. Second, we sold virtually no LED-based fixtures in 2008, and today, these solutions make up almost 2/3 of our net sales. We have invested significant significantly to make Acuity the leader in digital lighting, while at the same time delivering superior financial performance for our shareholders. 
While our record results for the quarter and the full year were significant improvements over the year-ago periods, they could have been even better. We would like to provide you with more color in our results for the quarter and the year.  
Net sales and profitability for the fourth quarter were all-time quarterly records. However, as I said, our results could have been even greater and here's why.  During the quarter we made the decision to accelerate certain actions to streamline our supply chain, enhance our customer service and drive productivity. These actions included, among others, the closure of a manufacturing location and the transfer of certain production to alternate locations in order to free up additional capacity for future growth and to better leverage our overall supply chain. These actions overlap with the ramping up of the new production facility and the addition of a new line. The combination of these actions created labor shortages in certain locations, which negatively impacted production and shipments, which resulted in canceled orders as well as added costs. We estimate these short-term labor issues resulted in canceled orders and lost contribution and more than $25 million of net sales and caused us to incur additional overtime and other costs in excess of $2 million in the quarter. We're not going to attempt to quantify the impact of these labor shortages had on our fourth quarter results beyond what I just noted just now. Please know the actions implemented this quarter will provide significant benefits to our business as we go forward. While the impact of these labor issues is mostly behind us, we may experience some modest carryover effect into our first quarter, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results.
Looking more closely on the fourth quarter, net sales grew 22% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew an impressive 13%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points, while changes in price/mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing in LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain component costs and to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based in most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for almost 2/3 of our total net sales and as you know, includes the sale of nonfixed related products and solutions as well.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions, and the strength of our sales forces, have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to commented our profitability and strategic -- accomplishments. Our profitability measures for the fourth quarter were outstanding even while absorbing the impact of the supply chain streamlining actions I noted earlier and the continued investments in areas of growth such as our unified lighting and building management platform and our IoT capabilities. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating profit was $156.5 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.9% and just shy of our quarterly record of 17.2%, but up 60 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was 43.5%, up 120 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout most of the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in the recent past had lower gross profit margins than Acuity, as well as the short-term impact of the supply chain streamlining actions taken during the quarter.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter, were up $48.1 million or 24%. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.6% in the quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of acquisitions and higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our fourth quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin. Excluding the impact of acquisitions on a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 26%, well within our current target of mid- to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
The story was much the same for the full year's record sales results -- full year record results in 2016. Net sales grew 22% this year. Excluding acquisitions, our net sales grew over 13%, while sales volume grew over 15%, more than 2x the estimated growth rate of our addressable market. Adjusted gross profit margin was a record 43.7%, up 140 basis points compared with the prior year's gross profit margin. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.9% improved 130 basis points over 2015. Our adjusted variable contribution margin for the full year, excluding acquisitions, was almost 30% even while we invested aggressively in areas which represent exciting growth opportunities. Again, we had another great year.
On the strategic front in 2016, we continued to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be a strong growth in profitability in 2017 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our Lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as our building management platform. With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls that also support building management and IoT applications. 
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy, winning accolades from customers and numerous industry awards this year for introducing solutions never seen before. In fact, Forbes Magazine recently recognized Acuity Brands in its top 100 most innovative companies list. No other lighting company or building management company made this exclusive list. This is a remarkable achievement of our extraordinary associates. And remember, this is from a company with longtime industry-leading brands, one of which has been in existence for almost 120 years.
Additionally, we continued to invest in and expand our company but capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consist of 4 tier levels. As we have noted before, the purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio of offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device which we categorize as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated lighting and building management solution, which we refer to as Tier 3, for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise in security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple, both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri, DGLogik [ph] and Juno in 2016 had meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic innovative solutions were up almost 40% this year over 2015 and now represent more than 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional recurring revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solutions.
To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organizational structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salary headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy.
In fact, our salaried headcount is up almost 30% from 1 year earlier and that includes [ph] acquisitions. Few other companies, if any, have been able to make this kind of investment while delivering upper quartile financial performance like Acuity. 
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best can control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment, while realizing additional benefits including energy and maintenance savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, and with the additions of Distech, Juno, DGLogik and Geometri, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we're not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. As I noted last quarter, we had converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including global leading retailers and certain other customers to smart lighting solutions. As part of their smart lighting solution platform, we had more than 200,000 maintenance-free beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful actionable information. Importantly, we are on a path to almost quadruple this installed base by the end of calendar 2016. We believe this level of capability in deployment is unmatched in our industry. 
integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a standalone company, continues to move along very well. We expect the combination of Distech and Acuity with our broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions, to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic, unified solutions that deliver true and optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
As an integral part of the strategy, we just introduced nlight  Eclipse, a powerful cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading controls, lighting controls, by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solutions that unifies lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines our building programming, facilitates our smart multizone daylight harvesting and color tuning capabilities and enhanced IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease of installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity  is driving the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities, and we are just getting started.
We expect our recent strategic acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the nonresidential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now almost 12,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving and solving and supporting the needs of our customers. 
I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our market expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2017. Ricky?"
1413208,384005193,1053227,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance",793,"Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance and not repeat information already provided by Vern.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily, due to the impact of 4 acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets; share-based compensation expense since we use restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of the shareholders; special charges as we streamlined and integrated recent acquisitions; and an impairment of intangible assets as we rationalized acquired trade names. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. 
In addition, many of our peer companies, especially as we become more of a technology company, make these same adjustments, so that will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.
During the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $4.9 million and $15 million, respectively, for actions initiated to streamline the organization including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities included the consolidation of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. 
We realized net savings in excess of $4 million in fiscal year 2016 and expect to achieve annual savings of twice the amount of the special charge, or approximately $30 million, and we believe will be at this run rate by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with further integration activities of recent acquisitions in fiscal year 2017, although the amount and exact timing has not yet been determined.
During the fourth quarter, we finalized our allocation of the purchase price for the Distech acquisition and refined the preliminary allocations for Juno, Geometri and DGLogik acquisitions. Consequently, we reduced our fourth quarter acquisition-related amortization expense by $4.4 million from the amount recorded in the third quarter. We expect to finalize the remaining purchase price allocations by the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our current estimate is that acquisition-related amortization expense will be approximately $5.8 million per quarter in fiscal year 2017. To provide full transparency of this noncash cost, we will continue to quantify this amount each quarter as part of our adjusted results. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.8% compared with 35% in the fourth quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 will once again be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
We did an excellent job this year of managing operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital was 38 days, which we believe is industry leading. 
In fiscal year 2016, we spent $83.7 million on capital expenditures compared with $56.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics and painting capacity and build-outs of our innovation and technology center and a new production facility, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.
At August 31, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $413.2 million a decrease of $343.6 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease is due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $623.2 million and the capital expenditures of $83.7 million as well as the paid dividends to shareholders of $22.9 million. 
Our total debt outstanding was $355.2 million at August 31, 2016, and we had more cash than debt at the year-end. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at August 31, 2016, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and we'll continue to see the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,384005193,1053227,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe contin",1047,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe continue to move along in a measured, but sometimes inconsistent pace. This year's presidential election in the U.S. and events such as U.K.'s referendum vote to exit the European Union continued to create uncertainty and volatility. This uncertainty and volatility has the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which in turn could negatively impact global economic activity. 
That notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for the continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observations for 2017.
First, we estimate the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales, will grow in the mid- to upper single-digit range in fiscal -- or 2017, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation and retrofit activity. Again, the favorable trend in our September order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American markets such as the Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending [ph] availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline, and steel costs -- which we expect to continue to rise, we do not anticipate significant changes in other material and component costs over the next 12 months. 
We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise, primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are always unpredictable. 
Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix as well as -- the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as sales volume grows and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to recent actions taken to accelerate the integration of acquisitions made in 2016. Our record adjusted gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a very positive picture.
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as only point of differentiation. 
Lastly and most importantly, we expect our overall growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve.  
Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building management solutions that, for example, connect smart devices with smartphones for many different end users as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base of connected devices by the end of calendar 2016.
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from our acquisitions of Distech, Geometri and DGLogik, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add significantly greater broad-based holistic solutions, allowing customers to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates of our Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories as well as the implementation of our IoT solutions. 
Further, the addition of Juno has meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track [ph] lighting as well as enhancing our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. We are still in the early stages of fully optimizing the potential of Juno as part of our portfolio. 
Our companywide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength, to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. 
Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient and effective solutions. We believe this is particularly compelling as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building management industries, some of which could grow by 50% or more over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have."

We just introduced nLight Eclipse, which is a truly, in our view, a game-changing solution set that doesn't exist in the industry today, where it provides a unified system, not an integrated system but a solution set that ties together HVAC, lighting access security and also provides a great capability to collect data and push that to the cloud and push that back through the IoT type solution set. So early, early, early stages of all this, but we're now seeing the growth and it's very exciting for us."

We still have some work to do. We took actions this quarter that obviously impact this quarter, but we did that because we really wanted to accelerate both our growth capacity, our capacity to service the growth that we are seeing and we'll continue to see, we believe, and number two, to drive productivity so that we can continue to have the type of variable contribution margins that we expect. And what we expect, as we said before, is kind of that mid-to upper 20s. It doesn't mean that we won't exceed it from time to time, but this quarter is a great example. In spite of the challenges that we had with some of the streamlining issues, we still delivered a 26%, 27% variable contribution margin. For the full year 2016, we were about 30%. So our expectation is, is that even as we anniversary the acquisitions, we'll still be in the very high rate while continuing to invest. And just to be clear, these numbers are pretty staggering. Acuity and its legacy business in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we added 100 people. We added 100 salaried people. We're investing heavily because we see huge growth coming our way. Over the last literally year including acquisitions, we've added almost 700 salaried heads to our capabilities. This is enormous capability. In the last quarter, we added almost 1,500 hourly people. Now that number will come down a little bit as we streamline the operations, but that really was what caused us to experience labor shortages and just onboarding issues as we ramp up the business. Because again, we see very, very robust growth. All this means as we think about 2017, our expectation is to continue to deliver a very robust variable contribution margin that is in that mid-to upper 20% range, while investing in our business."

And as you might imagine, it's being more lucrative in the higher-cost areas of both coasts, East Coast as well as West Coast. Some of those have diminished a bit from the rates we've seen in previous years, but we continue to see pretty aggressive incentives being offered by the utility companies. And then there are some tax accelerated benefits as well. On the regulatory front, continue to see most of the states implementing building codes that mandate certain levels of efficiencies. Much of it is around the level of control of lights where you need to put occupancy sensors and take advantage of turning lights off when a room or a stairwell or an area's not being occupied. But as in the case of Title 24 in California, you're seeing many of them go beyond that and start mandating how much you're allowed to consume per square foot and the level of integration of the entire office power grid. So the regulatory front continues to move forward, and we see it as another catalyst for our growth."

But ultimately, we expect it to be a nice margin contributor. Because you've invested the cost, it's almost  it's software related. So the margins that you come off of that, very consistent with other companies providing those types of capabilities. our expectation is our gross profit margin will continue to improve over time. And we will be able to continue to leverage as we hit sort of a plateauing probably sometime in late 2017, early 2018 on some of these investments. And then the revenues that will be returning off of those will make those -- the percentage of SDA become smaller relative to where it is today. We finished the year on an adjusted basis with SDA about 26.9%, let's call it 27%. Margins at of the gross profit level were about 43.7%. Again, our expectation is that our gross profit margins will continue to improve. And our SDA, we will continue to be able to leverage that. So the best way to think about our business is still in terms of variable contribution margin. we're still investing, though the investing is slowing down a tad because we have made significant investments in 2016. I would also say that when I look at our total costs for salaried associates as well as our total costs for hourly associates, as a percentage of our sales, those things continue to be flattish. And so that's why you are again seeing margins improve over the 2015 time period, whether it be in operating profit or at the gross profit level. So we are getting the leverage. It's coming through the variable contribution margin. And yet, we're still investing heavily in our business because again, we see really tremendous growth opportunity over the next decade."

Number two, your first question, the issue was we knew we were going to have to accelerate the consolidation of some of our manufacturing capabilities. We knew we were going to have to free up some capacity in key manufacturing facilities. So we decided during the quarter to make that investment, to accelerate those efforts. And so just sheer act of ramping up and attracting talent into the organization, [indiscernible] hourly talent, was a challenge particularly in a couple of areas because those areas are also experiencing growth from other companies moving into the market. We knew that was going to happen. We anticipated, but truthfully as we were ramping up, the whole notion of the number of -- the sheer number of folks that we needed and the training side of it resulted in us not wanting to ship product, because we wanted to make sure the quality was there and all of those issues. So we believe that we lost roughly $25 million. It's an estimate of lost orders and lost shipments during the quarter. And our guess is is, it's just a guess, that it probably cost us 70 bps of operating profit margin in total. So you can understand the magnitude, but we had to bite the bullet. We did it. We believe it's behind us. We think there maybe just some carryover lingering effect as orders ramp back up. Our order rates suggest that it's behind us. Our productive output is pretty close back to where it was in terms of our efficiencies and our effectiveness.

So there's no steps that others have to take. You don't have to worry about whether the mechanical folks or whether the electrical folks are going to work together.

Some of our main facilities are in locations where the growth rate is robust because they're just great locations to be in. And so as we are ramping up the number of people I had mentioned earlier, just the whole notion of bringing people onboard, training them, facilitating all that was a challenge, but it was a temporary challenge. I think few companies have the skill and capability to do it as effectively and as efficiently as we've done. This was basically a 60-day, 90-day type issue where we've done some meaningful things that will have a huge impact on the profitability of our business going forward as well as our ability to serve customers and to expand into new markets. The Distech acquisition and its integration is moving along exceptionally well, because they continue to focus on their core businesses. engineering departments are working together in a way to introduce solution sets like nLight Eclipse. That's never existed in the market before. We are meeting an unmet need. So -- and it will take a while for those sales to ramp up as the specifications cycle works its way through, as we train people, as people become acclimated to it. But no, our appetite for acquisitions continues. While I'm disappointed that we didn't -- we lost some revenues this quarter, I just am very pleased at how aggressively we attacked these things.

It's doing an exceptional work, but -- So I don't see any technical obsolescence.

As we think about Internet of Things and how we enable more folks to participate, we want people to use our driver, so that it can be part of a holistic system and their capabilities, whatever they happen to be, can participate in a solution set that an architect lighting design or a building owners would like to have, including their luminaires. I wish I could tell you we make every luminaire known to man. We don't. so our branding strategy is to get others that fill in gaps and have opportunities to participate on the overall system to be part of the digital backbone. And Acuity can then guarantee to the building owners that it's going to work and work the way they want and it will do everything that they want. So that's really what we're driving towards."

So Brian, the way we look at the market as we said, there's new construction. And we all know how to do that. There's an architect, lighting designer, engineer, building owner, electrical contractor, electrical distributor [indiscernible]. The next",546,"Sure. So Brian, the way we look at the market as we said, there's new construction. And we all know how to do that. There's an architect, lighting designer, engineer, building owner, electrical contractor, electrical distributor [indiscernible]. The next portion of the market is planned renovation. That's where someone again will hire architect, engineer, lighting designer. And they'll go after and they'll say, ""I'm going to remodel a wing of my house."" Great. That looks like new construction to us. Then there's this world of what we call unplanned renovation. It's what exists out there every day. And you use your office every day, and you don't think about the lights that are above you. It's that world that we are looking to attack in a much more aggressive and holistic way, bringing them solutions that will cause them to say, ""Yes, I want to go from having analog lighting to digital lighting. Yes I want to go from having an analog HVAC building management system to a digital building management system."" Our view is that the installed base, and I've given these statistics before, DOE estimates that there's 100 billion square feet of building space in the U.S. A few years ago, our guesstimate was that it was about $3 a square foot to convert, $2.50 a square foot for fixtures, another $0.50 a square foot of controls. We believe today that with our solution sets, the unified nLight Eclipse system, for example, the ability to enable Internet of Things to collect data off of this, to provide many more features and benefits of the data and what it can do in the space to have the building owners optimize what they're doing, is a unique and compelling value proposition. So the conversion of that installed base and the value of that installed base we think is much higher than what we had originally estimated, 2x or 3x higher. And then you put that outdoor, which is another third the size of that. It's a huge market place. DOE also estimates that less than 15% of the outdoor market has been converted to date. Less than 5% of the indoor market has converted to date. We believe that to be true. I mean, just looking all offices have down the street, and you'll see the tremendous amount of opportunity. So what Acuity is doing and what investments that we have made in ramping up not only our had done, but also the acquisitions that we've made, very strategic in nature, will give us capability to go after that installed base in a very aggressive way. It's equally applicable to new construction as well as planned renovation, but the unplanned renovation market that is huge, I mean, 800 billion or more than that. So that's what we're targeting as a growth opportunity. We continue to do well in new construction and planned renovation. see opportunities for continued growth there. We think that we're taking share in that space, but where we think we can really turbocharge our business is to get after the unplanned renovation. And that's what's gives us enthusiasm for outsized growth relative to the growth rates of the markets that we serve as well as being less dependent upon new construction by itself."

We sell poles for outdoor lighting. when we think about where our mix actually is for our lighting business -- and we sell control systems, too. It is a much higher percentage than what it means to the overall sales. So ultimately, I see Acuity sales continuing to grow in multiple areas, including selling more luminaires. But I think LED as a percentage, I don't know what the exact number will be. But it will hit a fixed percentage because it will have been converted virtually all to LED within our luminaire business. I still think that, that is a few years away, but I believe it will happen, particularly as LEDs just become more efficacious. But there are -- and they are doing that. So I think that for our business, I don't know what the exact percentage will be because we sell other things and we'll want to sell those other things. Those other items will continue to grow. I mean, our building management systems which tie, now that we have nLight Eclipse, in a unified way with HVAC and other and lighting and so on and so forth. We expect that to grow fairly significantly. So it will continue as a percentage of the total, make LEDs -- we will hold that percentage to our total. And there will always be other technologies that will come out there that will be directly LED that we will also continue to self and they'll be a small portion of our business as well."

First, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in 2016. We achieved record results for virtually all financial metrics, including net sales, operating profit, diluted earnings per share and cash flow generation. For the full year and the fourth quarter, net sales grew approximately 22%, while sales volume, excluding acquisitions, was more than double the estimated mid-single-digit growth rates of the key markets we serve. In fact, this was the 14th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement that few companies can claim. 
We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to deliver superior returns to shareholders, provide customers with differentiated value-added solutions and diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative energy-efficient lighting and building management solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity. 
We achieved record profitability for the quarter and full year, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting and building management solutions portfolio, which affords us a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things. 
I know many of you've already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights.  First, for the quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a quarterly record of $926 million, an increase of 22% compared with the year-ago period. Our net sales could have been even higher, as I will explain later in the call.  Reported operating profit was $135.1 million compared with $111.8 million in the year-ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.89, a quarterly record compared with the $1.37 in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items, which Ricky will explain later in the call. 
Also our reported financial results included certain items, among others, such as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles. Because many shareholders and analysts ask specific questions regarding these items, in order to make our results comparable between periods, we will continue to add back these items to our reported results to provide greater transparency and comparability. 
In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $156.5 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $123.6 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 27%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.9%, an increase of 60 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.21, up 27% from the year-ago period against strong quarterly results.
For the full year, net sales at Acuity were a record $3.3 billion, up 22% from 2015. Reported operating profit was $475 million in 2016 compared with $376 million in the year-ago period, while diluted earnings per share was $6.63, up 30% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit was $555 million in 2016, up 32% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was a record 16.9%, up 130 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $7.84, up almost 35% in 2015. 
In addition, we generated a record $346 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year, up 20% from last year. We closed the year with $413 million of cash on hand, even after investing $623 million for acquisitions as well as $84 million in capital expenditures this year, leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our growth strategies. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital. Our adjusted cash flow return on investment for 2016 was 34%, tying our all-time high even after the significant investments made this year. We believe this level of return is far in excess of others in the electrical industry. For those who follow EVA, we generated over $150 million in positive EVA, an outstanding achievement.
To put our performance in perspective, I'd like to remind folks of 2 points. First, the nonresidential construction market, an important market for us, is still down about 15% on an inflation-adjusted basis from its peak in 2008, and yet, our net sales are up 65% since then. Second, we sold virtually no LED-based fixtures in 2008, and today, these solutions make up almost 2/3 of our net sales. We have invested significantly to make Acuity the leader in digital lighting, while at the same time delivering superior financial performance for our shareholders. 
While our record results for the quarter and the full year were significant improvements over the year-ago periods, they could have been even better. We would like to provide you with more color on our results for the quarter and the year.  
Net sales and profitability for the fourth quarter were all-time quarterly records. However, as I said, our results could have been even greater and here's why.  During the quarter, we made a decision to accelerate certain actions to streamline our supply chain, enhance our customer service and drive productivity. These actions included, among others, the closure of a manufacturing location and the transfer of certain production to alternate locations in order to free up additional capacity for future growth and to better leverage our overall supply chain. These actions overlap with the ramping up of a new production facility and the addition of a new paint line. The combination of these actions created labor shortages in certain locations, which negatively impacted production and shipments, which resulted in canceled orders as well as added costs. We estimate these short-term labor issues resulted in canceled orders and lost contribution and more than $25 million of net sales and caused us to incur additional overtime and other costs in excess of $2 million in the quarter. We're not going to attempt to quantify the impact of these labor shortages had on our fourth quarter results beyond what I noted just now. Please know the actions implemented this quarter will provide significant benefits to our business as we go forward. While the impact of these labor issues is mostly behind us, we may experience some modest carryover effect into our first quarter, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results.
Looking more closely on the fourth quarter, net sales grew 22% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew an impressive 13%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points, while changes in price/mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on light kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain component costs and, to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for almost 2/3 of our total net sales, as you know, includes the sale of nonfixture-related products and solutions as well.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces, have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments. Our profitability measures for the fourth quarter were outstanding, even while absorbing the impact of the supply chain streamlining actions I noted earlier and the continued investments in areas of growth, such as our unified lighting and building management platform and our IoT capabilities. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating profit was $156.5 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.9% and just shy of our quarterly record of 17.2%, but up 60 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was 43.5%, up 120 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout most of the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past has had lower gross profit margin than Acuity as well as a short-term impact of the supply chain streamlining actions taken during the quarter.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter, were up $48.1 million or 24%. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.6% in the current quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of acquisitions and higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our fourth quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisitions. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 26%, well within our current target of mid- to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
The story was much the same for the full year's record sales results -- full year record results in 2016. Net sales grew 22% this year. Excluding acquisitions, our net sales grew over 13% while sales volume grew over 15%, more than 2x the estimated growth rate of our addressable market. Adjusted gross profit margin was a record 43.7%, up 140 basis points compared with the prior year's gross profit margin. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.9% improved 130 basis points over 2015. Our adjusted variable contribution margin for the full year, excluding acquisitions, was almost 30%, even while we invested aggressively in areas which represent exciting growth opportunities. Again, we had another great year.
On the strategic front in 2016, we continued to make great strides, setting a stage for what we believe will be a strong growth in profitability in 2017 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our Lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as our building management platform. With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls that also support building management and IoT applications. 
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy, winning accolades from customers and numerous industry awards this year for introducing solutions never seen before. In fact, Forbes Magazine recently recognized Acuity Brands in its top 100 most innovative companies list. No other lighting company or building management company made this exclusive list. This is a remarkable achievement for our extraordinary associates. And remember, this is from a company with longtime industry-leading brands, one of which has been in existence for almost 120 years.
Additionally, we continued to invest and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consist of 4 tier levels. As we have noted before, the purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device, which we categorize as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated lighting and building management solution, which we refer to as Tier 3, for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple, both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri, DGLogik and Juno in 2016 had meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic, integrated solutions were up almost 40% this year over 2015 and now represent more than 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional recurring revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solutions.
To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organizational structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salaried headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy.
In fact, our salaried headcount is up over 30% from 1 year earlier and that includes acquisitions. Few other companies, if any, have been able to make this kind of investment while delivering upper quartile financial performance like Acuity. 
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best can control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment, while realizing additional benefits, including energy and maintenance savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, and with the additions of Distech, Juno, DGLogik and Geometri, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we're not just talking the Internet of Things, we are doing it. As I noted last quarter, we had converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including global leading retailers and certain other customers to smart lighting solutions. As part of their smart lighting solution platform, we had more than 200,000 maintenance-free beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful actionable information. Importantly, we are on a path to almost quadruple this installed base by the end of calendar 2016. We believe this level of capability in deployment is unmatched in our industry. 
Integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a standalone company, continues to move along very well. We expect the combination of Distech and Acuity with our broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic, unified solutions that deliver true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
As an integral part of this strategy, we just introduced nLight ECLYPSE, a powerful, cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading controls -- lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solutions that unify lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines our building programming, facilitates our smart multizone daylight harvesting and color tuning capabilities and enhanced IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease in installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity is driving the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities, and we are just getting started.
We expect our recent strategic acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We've been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now almost 12,000 associates, who are maniacally focused on serving and solving and supporting the needs of our customers. 
I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our market expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2017. Ricky?"

As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance",795,"Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance and not repeat the information already provided by Vern.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily, due to the impact of the 4 acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets; share-based compensation expense since we used restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of the shareholders; special charges as we streamlined and integrated recent acquisitions; and an impairment of intangible assets as we rationalized acquired trade names. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. 
In addition, many of our peer companies, especially as we become more of a technology company, make these same adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.
During the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $4.9 million and $15 million, respectively, for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities included the consolidation of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. 
We realized net savings in excess of $4 million in fiscal year 2016 and expect to achieve annual savings of twice the amount of the special charge, or approximately $30 million, and we believe will be at this run rate by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with further integration activities of recent acquisitions in fiscal year 2017, although the amount and exact timing has not yet been determined.
During the fourth quarter, we finalized our allocation of the purchase price for the Distech acquisition and refined the preliminary allocations for Juno, Geometri and DGLogik acquisitions. Consequently, we reduced our fourth quarter acquisition-related amortization expense by $4.4 million from the amount recorded in the third quarter. We expect to finalize the remaining purchase price allocations by the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our current estimate is that acquisition-related amortization expense will be approximately $5.8 million per quarter in fiscal year 2017. To provide full transparency of this noncash cost, we will continue to quantify this amount each quarter as part of our adjusted results. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.8% compared with 35% in the fourth quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 will once again be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
We did an excellent job this year of managing operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital was 38 days, which we believe is industry leading. 
In fiscal year 2016, we spent $83.7 million on capital expenditures compared with $56.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics and painting capacity and build-outs of our innovation and technology center and a new production facility, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.
At August 31, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $413.2 million, a decrease of $343.6 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease was due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $623.2 million and the capital expenditures of $83.7 million as well as the paid dividends to shareholders of $22.9 million. 
Our total debt outstanding was $355.2 million at August 31, 2016, and we had more cash than debt at the year-end. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at August 31, 2016, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and we'll continue to see the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."

As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe contin",1053,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe continue to move along in a measured, but sometimes inconsistent pace. This year's presidential election in the U.S. and events such as U.K.'s referendum vote to exit the European Union continue to create uncertainty and volatility. This uncertainty and volatility always has the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which in turn could negatively impact global economic activity. 
That notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for the continued -- for continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observations for 2017.
First, we estimate the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales, will grow in the mid- to upper single-digit range in fiscal 2017, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation and retrofit activity. Again, the favorable trend in our September order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American market, such as the Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, and steel costs, which we continue -- which we expect to continue to rise, we do not anticipate significant changes in other material and component costs over the next 12 months. 
We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are always unpredictable. 
Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix as well as current dilutive -- the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as sales volume grows, as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to recent actions taken to accelerate the integration of acquisitions made in 2016. Our record adjusted gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a very positive picture.
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation. 
Lastly and most importantly, we expect our overall growth rate to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve.  
Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building management solutions that, for example, connect smart devices with smartphones for many different end users as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base of connected devices by the end of calendar 2016.
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from our acquisitions of Distech, Geometri and DGLogik, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add significantly greater broad-based holistic solutions, allowing customers to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates of our Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories as well as the implementation of our IoT solutions. 
Further, the addition of Juno has meaningfully expanded and strengthened our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhancing our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. We are still in the early stages of fully optimizing the potential of Juno as part of our portfolio. 
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength, to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. 
Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and, more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient and effective solutions. We believe this is particularly compelling as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building management industries, some of which could grow by 50% or more over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have."

I'm talking, pick the next 1,000 days, I think you're going to see a meaningful change and a meaningful adoption of these Tier 3 solutions that Acuity is offering and then the opportunity for it to enable Tier 4 revenues for Acuity. We just introduced nLight ECLYPSE, which is truly, in our view, a game-changing solution set that doesn't exist in the industry today, where it provides a unified system, not an integrated system, but a solution set that ties together HVAC, lighting, access, security and also provides a great capability to collect data and push that to the cloud and push that back through the IoT-type solution set. So early, early, early stages of all this, but we're now seeing the growth and it's very exciting for us."

We still have some work to do. We took actions this quarter that, obviously, impacted this quarter, but we did that because we really wanted to accelerate both our growth capacity, our capacity to service the growth that we are seeing, and we'll continue to see, we believe, and number two, to drive productivity, so that we can continue to have the type of variable contribution margins that we expect. And what we expect, as we said before, is kind of that mid- to upper 20s. It doesn't mean that we won't exceed it from time to time, but this quarter is a great example. In spite of the challenges that we had with some of the streamlining issues, we still delivered a 26%, 27% variable contribution margin. For the full year 2016, we were about 30%. So our expectation is, is that even as we anniversary the acquisitions, we'll still be in the very high rate while continuing to invest. And just to be clear, these numbers are pretty staggering. Acuity and its legacy business in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we added 100 people. We added 100 salaried people. We're investing heavily because we see huge growth coming our way. Over the last, literally, year, including acquisitions, we've added almost 700 salaried heads to our capabilities. This is an enormous capability. In the last quarter, we added almost 1,500 hourly people. Now that number will come down a little bit as we streamline the operations, but that really was what caused us to experience both labor shortages and just onboarding issues as we ramp up the business because, again, we see very, very robust growth. All this means as we think about 2017, our expectation is to continue to deliver a very robust variable contribution margin that is in that mid- to upper 20% range while investing in our business."

And as you might imagine, it's been more lucrative in the higher-cost areas of both coasts, East Coast as well as West Coast. Some of those have diminished a bit from the rates we've seen in previous years, but continue to see pretty aggressive incentives being offered by the utility companies. And then there are some tax accelerated benefits as well. On the regulatory front, continue to see most of the states implementing building codes that mandate certain levels of efficiencies. Much of it is around the level of control of lights where you need to put occupancy sensors and take advantage of turning lights off when a room or a stairwell or an area is not being occupied. But as in the case of Title 24 in California, you're seeing many of them go beyond that and start mandating how much you're allowed to consume per square foot and the level of integration of the entire office power grid. So the regulatory front continues to move forward, and we see it as another catalyst for our growth."

But ultimately, we expect it to be a nice margin contributor because you've invested the cost. It's almost -- it's software related. So the margins that you come off of that should be very consistent with other companies providing those types of capabilities. So our expectation is that our gross profit margin will continue to improve over time. And we will be able to continue to leverage as we hit sort of a plateauing probably sometime in late 2017, early 2018 of some of these investments. And then the revenues that will be returning off of those will make those -- the percentage of SDA become smaller relative to where it is today. We finished the year on an adjusted basis with SDA about 26.9%, let's call it 27%. Margins at the gross profit level were about 43.7%. Again, our expectation is that our gross profit margins will continue to improve. And our SDA, we will continue to be able to leverage that. So the best way to think about our business is still in terms of variable contribution margin. We're still investing, though the investing is slowing down a tad because we have made significant investments in 2016. I would also say that when I look at our total costs for salaried associates as well as our total costs for hourly associates as a percentage of our sales, those things continue to be flattish. And so that's why you're again seeing margins improve over the 2015 time period, whether it be at operating profit or at the gross profit level. So we are getting the leverage. It's coming through the variable contribution margin. And yet, we're still investing heavily in our business, because, again, we see really tremendous growth opportunity over the next decade."

The September order rate for Acuity is meaningfully outperforming the industry, as we pointed out. Number two, your first question, the issue was we knew we were going to have to accelerate the consolidation of some of our manufacturing capabilities. We knew we were going to have to free up some capacity in key manufacturing facilities. So we decided during the quarter to make that investment to accelerate those efforts. And so the sheer act of ramping up and attracting talent into the organization, I'm talking about hourly talent, was a challenge, particularly in a couple of areas, because those areas are also experiencing growth from other companies moving into the market. We knew that was going to happen, we anticipated, but truthfully, as we were ramping up, the whole notion of the number of -- the sheer number of folks that we needed and then the training side of it resulted in us not wanting to ship product, because we wanted to make sure the quality was there and all of those issues. So we believe that we lost roughly $25 million. It's an estimate of lost orders and lost shipments during the quarter. And our guess is that it's just a guess that it probably cost us 70 bps of operating profit margin in total. So you can understand the magnitude, but we had to bite the bullet. We did it. We believe it's behind us. We think there may be some just carryover lingering effect as orders ramp back up. Our order rates suggest that it's behind us. Our productive output is pretty close back to where it was in terms of our efficiencies and our effectiveness. So we're not expecting any of the lingering issues to have a material impact on our first quarter results."

And so sometimes, you have to move things around to be able to do that. You hope that they always go perfectly. I think we did a good job. We just caught a little bit of a perfect storm. Some of our main facilities are in locations where the growth rate is robust, because they're just great locations to be in. And so as we're ramping up the number of people I had mentioned earlier, just the whole notion of bringing people onboard, training them and facilitating all that was a challenge, but it was a temporary challenge. I think few companies have the skill and capability to do it as effectively and as efficiently as we've done. This was basically a 60-day, 90-day type issue where we've done some meaningful things that will have a huge impact on the profitability of our business going forward as well as our ability to serve customers and to expand into new markets. The Distech acquisition and its integration is moving along exceptionally well, because they continue to focus on their core businesses. The engineering departments are working together in a way to introduce solution sets like nLight ECLYPSE. That's never existed in the market before. We are meeting an unmet need. So -- and it will take a while for those sales to ramp up as the specifications cycle works its way through, as we train people, as people become acclimated to it. But no, our appetite for acquisitions continues. While I'm disappointed that we didn't -- we lost some revenues this quarter, I just am very pleased at how aggressively we attacked these things, because we do see robust growth of not only on the lighting side but the building management side. We see growth in the Juno product lines that they brought to us, and we see growth in the combination of Acuity and Juno. So we're very bullish about what we see on a go-forward basis."

I don't see any of this current environment being any different because of how our supply chain works. We don't have legacy fixed assets, because we don't make lamps. We don't make many things that require heavy investment. We're a design and procurer and assembler of product to meet our specifications. So the investments that we have been making have really been to expand, if you will, our physical capacity in some areas because of the growth. Our electronics business is just on fire. It's doing an exceptional work, but -- so I don't see any technical obsolescence. As we think about the moves that we took in the fourth quarter, it was really about training people and bringing people onboard and then stabilizing that process. We added an enormous number of folks, as I had mentioned earlier in the call. So I think we have managed it exceedingly well. I wish we had managed it even better. Typically, we do these things and you, the shareholders, don't really see a blip. This time, it was pretty big. And so the consolidation of what we've done, we believe, will have huge benefits on a go-forward basis. So again, I don't really see much in the way of issues. It's training. It's development of our people. We're good at that. It just happened very, very quickly, because we've made the decision to accelerate, not go slow, but go quickly, because we believe that the growth, particularly on the installed base, renovation and retrofit activity, is a huge opportunity for Acuity. We've introduced some great new products and solution sets to really go after that market even more aggressively. So we're ramping up our capacity and we made the decision to do that in a location where it would have its permanent home, not do it in places where it would be temporary. So that's what caused us to want to accelerate this activity, because we see great future growth going forward."

That market, like really all markets, is based on features and benefits and capabilities of your solution set and how you have used technology and knowhow to create a difference. I believe that we use other light engines as well from other folks. So the notion of creating an industry standard is a little different in that we want to offer features and benefits where our eldoLED driver for many of our partners or friends, and we want to enable more, really provides a capability that is unmatched in the industry. So it's a solution set that people would identify with. And by virtue of its features and benefits, we would hope that they would prefer that over others and then, therefore, it becomes the driver of choice for many applications. As we think about the Internet of Things and how we enable more folks to participate, we want people to use our driver, so that it can be part of a holistic system and their capabilities, whatever they happen to be, can participate in a solution set that an architect lighting design a building owner would like to have, including their luminaires. I wish I could tell you we make every luminaire known to man. We don't, and so our branding strategy is to get others that fill in gaps and have opportunities to participate on the overall system to be part of the digital backbone. And Acuity can then guarantee to the building owner that it's going to work and work the way they want, and it will do everything that they want. So that's really what we're driving towards."

So, Brian, the way we look at the market, as we said, there's new construction. And we all know how to do that. There's an architect, lighting designer, engineer, building owner, electrical contractor, electrical distributor of all. Next portion of the market is planned renovation. That's where someone again will hire architect, engineer, lighting designer. And they'll go after and they'll say, ""I'm going to remodel a wing of my house, it'll look great."" That looks like new construction to us. Then there's this world of what we call unplanned renovation. It's what exists out there every day. And you use your office every day, and you don't think about the lights that are above you. It's that world that we are looking to attack in a much more aggressive and holistic way, bringing them solutions that will cause them to say, ""Yes, I want to go from having analog lighting to digital lighting. Yes, I want to go from having an analog HVAC building management system to a digital building management system."" Our view is that the installed base, and I've given these statistics before, DOE estimates that there's 100 billion square feet of building space in the U.S. A few years ago, our guesstimate was that it was about $3 a square foot to convert: $2.50 a square foot for fixtures and another $0.50 a square foot for controls. We believe today that with our solution sets, the unified nLight ECLYPSE system, for example, the ability to enable Internet of Things to collect data off of this to provide many more features and benefits of data and what it can do in the space to help a building owner optimize what they're doing, is a unique and compelling value proposition. So the conversion of that installed base and the value of that installed base, we think, is much higher than what we had originally estimated, 2 or 3x higher. And then you put in that outdoor, which is another third the size of that. It's a huge marketplace. DOE also estimates that less than 15% of the outdoor market has been converted to date. Less than 5% of the indoor market has converted to date. We believe that to be true. I mean, just look in all offices, drive down the street, and you'll see the tremendous amount of opportunity. So what Acuity is doing and what investments that we have made in ramping up not only our headcount, but also the acquisitions that we've made, very strategic in nature, will give us capability to go after that installed base in a very aggressive way. It's equally applicable to new construction as well as planned renovation, but the unplanned renovation market that -- is huge, I mean, $800 billion or more than that. So that's what we're targeting as a growth opportunity. We continue to do well in new construction and planned renovation. We see opportunities for continued growth there. We think that we're taking share in that space, but where we think we can really turbocharge our business is to get after the unplanned renovation. And that's what gives us enthusiasm for outsized growth relative to the growth rates of the markets that we serve as well as being less dependent upon new construction by itself."

So LEDs today represent almost 2/3 of our total revenues, but I just want to emphasize that Acuity has revenues other than fixture products. Obviously, Distech; it's a simple example, but we also sell emergency lighting. We will sell poles for outdoor lighting. So when we think about where our mix actually is for our lighting business -- and we sell control systems, too, it is a much higher percentage than what it means to the overall sales. So ultimately, I see Acuity sales continuing to grow in multiple areas, including selling more luminaires. But I think LED as a percentage, I don't know what the exact number will be. But it will hit a fixed percentage, because it'll have been converted virtually all to LED within our luminaire business. I still think that, that is a few years away, but I believe it'll happen, particularly as LEDs just become more efficacious. But there are -- and they are doing that. So I think that for our business, I don't know what the exact percentage will be, because we sell other things, and we'll want to sell those other things. Those other items will continue to grow. I mean, our building management systems, which tie, now that we have nLight ECLYPSE, in a unified way with HVAC and other lighting and so and so forth, we expect that to grow fairly significantly. So it will continue as a percentage of the total, make LEDs -- we will hold that percentage to our total.

First, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in 2016. We achieved record results for virtually all financial metrics, including net sales, operating profit, diluted earnings per share and cash flow generation. For the full year and the fourth quarter, net sales grew approximately 22%, while sales volume, excluding acquisitions, was more than double the estimated mid-single-digit growth rates of the key markets we serve. In fact, this was the 14th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement that few companies can claim. 
We believe these results are yet again strong evidence our strategies to deliver superior returns to shareholders, provide customers with differentiated value-added solutions and diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative energy-efficient lighting and building management solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity. 
We achieved record profitability for the quarter and full year, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting and building management solutions portfolio, which affords us a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things. 
I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights.  First, for the quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a quarterly record of $926 million, an increase of 22% compared with the year-ago period. Our net sales could have been even higher, as I will explain later in the call.  Reported operating profit was $135.1 million compared with $111.8 million in the year-ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.89, a quarterly record compared with the $1.37 in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items, which Ricky will explain later in the call. 
Also our reported financial results included certain items, among others, such as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles. Because many shareholders and analysts ask specific questions regarding these items, in order to make our results comparable between periods, we will continue to add back these items to our reported results to provide greater transparency and comparability. 
In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $156.5 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $123.6 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 27%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.9%, an increase of 60 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.21, up 27% from the year-ago period against strong quarterly results.
For the full year, net sales at Acuity were a record $3.3 billion, up 22% from 2015. Reported operating profit was $475 million in 2016 compared with $376 million in the year-ago period, while diluted earnings per share was $6.63, up 30% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit was $555 million in 2016, up 32% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was a record 16.9%, up 130 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $7.84, up almost 35% from 2015. 
In addition, we generated a record $346 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year, up 20% from last year. We closed the year with $413 million of cash on hand, even after investing $623 million for acquisitions as well as $84 million in capital expenditures this year, leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our growth strategies. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital. Our adjusted cash flow return on investment for 2016 was 34%, tying our all-time high even after the significant investments made this year. We believe this level of return is far in excess of others in the electrical industry. For those who follow EVA, we generated over $150 million in positive EVA, an astounding achievement.
To put our performance in perspective, I'd like to remind folks of 2 points. First, the nonresidential construction market, an important market for us, is still down about 15% on an inflation-adjusted basis from its peak in 2008, and yet, our net sales are up 65% since then. Second, we sold virtually no LED-based fixtures in 2008, and today, these solutions make up almost 2/3 of our net sales. We have invested significantly to make Acuity the leader in digital lighting, while at the same time delivering superior financial performance for our shareholders. 
While our record results for the quarter and the full year were significant improvements over the year-ago periods, they could have been even better. We would like to provide you with more color on our results for the quarter and the year.  
Net sales and profitability for the fourth quarter were all-time quarterly records. However, as I said, our results could have been even greater and here's why. During the quarter, we made the decision to accelerate certain actions to streamline our supply chain, enhance our customer service and drive productivity. These actions included, among others, the closure of a manufacturing location and the transfer of certain production to alternate locations in order to free up additional capacity for future growth and to better leverage our overall supply chain. These actions overlap with the ramping up of a new production facility and the addition of a new paint line. The combination of these actions created labor shortages in certain locations, which negatively impacted production and shipments, which resulted in canceled orders as well as added costs. We estimate these short-term labor issues resulted in canceled orders and lost contribution and more than $25 million of net sales and caused us to incur additional overtime and other costs in excess of $2 million in the quarter. We're not going to attempt to quantify the impact of these labor shortages had on our fourth quarter results beyond what I noted just now. Please know the actions implemented this quarter will provide significant benefits to our business as we go forward. While the impact of these labor issues is mostly behind us, we may experience some modest carryover effect into our first quarter, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results.
Looking more closely at the fourth quarter, net sales grew 22% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew an impressive 13%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points, while changes in price/mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on light kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain component costs and, to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for almost 2/3 of our total net sales, as you know, includes the sale of nonfixture-related products and solutions as well.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces, have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments. Our profitability measures for the fourth quarter were outstanding, even while absorbing the impact of the supply chain streamlining actions I noted earlier and the continued investments in areas of growth, such as our unified lighting and building management platform and our IoT capabilities. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating profit was $156.5 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.9% and just shy of our quarterly record of 17.2%, but up 60 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was 43.5%, up 120 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout most of the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past has had lower gross profit margin than Acuity as well as a short-term impact of the supply chain streamlining actions taken during the quarter.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter, were up $48.1 million or 24%. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.6% in the current quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of acquisitions and higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our fourth quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisitions. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 26%, well within our current target of mid- to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
The story was much the same for the full year's record sales results -- full year record results in 2016. Net sales grew 22% this year. Excluding acquisitions, our net sales grew over 13% while sales volume grew over 15%, more than 2x the estimated growth rate of our addressable market. Adjusted gross profit margin was a record 43.7%, up 140 basis points compared with the prior year's gross profit margin. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.9% improved 130 basis points over 2015. Our adjusted variable contribution margin for the full year, excluding acquisitions, was almost 30%, even while we invested aggressively in areas which represent exciting growth opportunities. Again, we had another great year.
On the strategic front in 2016, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be a strong growth in profitability in 2017 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our Lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as our building management platform. With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls that also support building management and IoT applications. 
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy, winning accolades from customers and numerous industry awards this year for introducing solutions never seen before. In fact, Forbes Magazine recently recognized Acuity Brands in its top 100 most innovative companies list. No other lighting company or building management company made this exclusive list. This is a remarkable achievement for our extraordinary associates. And remember, this is from a company with longtime industry-leading brands, one of which has been in existence for almost 120 years.
Additionally, we continued to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consist of 4 tier levels. As we have noted before, the purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be single device, which we categorize as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated lighting and building management solution, which we refer to as Tier 3, for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple, both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri, DGLogik and Juno in 2016 have meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic, integrated solutions were up almost 40% this year over 2015 and now represent more than 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity through the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional recurring revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solutions.
To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organizational structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salaried headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy.
In fact, our salaried headcount is up over 30% from 1 year earlier and that includes acquisitions. Few other companies, if any, have been able to make this kind of investment while delivering upper quartile financial performance like Acuity. 
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best can control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment, while realizing additional benefits, including energy and maintenance savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, and with the additions of Distech, Juno, DGLogik and Geometri, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we're not just talking the Internet of Things, we are doing it. As I noted last quarter, we had converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including global leading retailers and certain other customers, to smart lighting solutions. As part of their smart lighting solution platform, we had more than 200,000 maintenance-free beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with a superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful actionable information. Importantly, we are on a path to almost quadruple this installed base by the end of calendar 2016. We believe this level of capability in deployment is unmatched in our industry. 
Integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a standalone company, continues to move along very well. We expect the combination of Distech and Acuity with our broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic, unified solutions that deliver true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
As an integral part of this strategy, we just introduced nLight ECLYPSE, a powerful, cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading controls -- lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solutions that unify lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines our building programming, facilitates our smart multizone daylight harvesting and color tuning capabilities and enhanced IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease in installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity is driving the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities, and we are just getting started.
We expect our recent strategic acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We've been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now almost 12,000 associates, who are maniacally focused on serving and solving and supporting the needs of our customers. 
I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our market expectations for the construction markets later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2017. Ricky?"

As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance",795,"Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance and not repeat the information already provided by Vern.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily, due to the impact of the 4 acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets; share-based compensation expense since we used restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of the shareholders; special charges as we streamlined and integrated recent acquisitions; and an impairment of intangible assets as we rationalized acquired trade names. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. 
In addition, many of our peer companies, especially as we become more of a technology company, make these same adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.
During the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $4.9 million and $15 million, respectively, for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities included the consolidation of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. 
We realized net savings in excess of $4 million in fiscal year 2016 and expect to achieve annual savings of twice the amount of the special charge, or approximately $30 million, and we believe we'll be at this run rate by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with further integration activities of recent acquisitions in fiscal year 2017, although the amount and exact timing has not yet been determined.
During the fourth quarter, we finalized our allocation of the purchase price for the Distech acquisition and refined the preliminary allocations for Juno, Geometri and DGLogik acquisitions. Consequently, we reduced our fourth quarter acquisition-related amortization expense by $4.4 million from the amount recorded in the third quarter. We expect to finalize the remaining purchase price allocations by the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our current estimate is that acquisition-related amortization expense will be approximately $5.8 million per quarter in fiscal year 2017. To provide full transparency of this noncash cost, we will continue to quantify this amount each quarter as part of our adjusted results. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.8% compared with 35% in the fourth quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to once again be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
We did an excellent job this year of managing operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital was 38 days, which we believe is industry leading. 
In fiscal year 2016, we spent $83.7 million on capital expenditures compared with $56.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics and painting capacity and build-outs of our innovation and technology center and a new production facility, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.
At August 31, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $413.2 million, a decrease of $343.6 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease was due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $623.2 million and the capital expenditures of $83.7 million as well as the paid dividends to shareholders of $22.9 million. 
Our total debt outstanding was $355.2 million at August 31, 2016, and we had more cash than debt at the year-end. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at August 31, 2016, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,384005193,1053347,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe contin",1055,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe continue to move along in a measured, but sometimes inconsistent pace. This year's presidential election in the U.S. and events such as U.K.'s referendum vote to exit the European Union continue to create uncertainty and volatility. This uncertainty and volatility always has the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which in turn could negatively impact global economic activity. 
That notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for the continued -- for continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observations for 2017.
First, we estimate the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales, will grow in the mid- to upper single-digit range in fiscal 2017, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation and retrofit activity. Again, the favorable trend in our September order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American market, such as the Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, and steel costs, which we continue -- which we expect to continue to rise, we do not anticipate significant changes in other material and component costs over the next 12 months. 
We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are always unpredictable. 
Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix as well as current dilutive -- the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as sales volume grows, as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to recent actions taken to accelerate the integration of acquisitions made in 2016. Our record adjusted gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a very positive picture.
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation. 
Lastly and most importantly, we expect our overall growth rate to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve.  
Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building management solutions that, for example, connect smart devices with smartphones for many different end users as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base of connected devices by the end of calendar 2016.
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from our acquisitions of Distech, Geometri and DGLogik, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add significantly greater broad-based holistic solutions, allowing customers to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates of our Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories as well as the implementation of our IoT solutions. 
Further, the addition of Juno has meaningfully expanded and strengthened our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhancing our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. We are still in the early stages of fully optimizing the potential of Juno as part of our portfolio. 
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength, to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. 
Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and, more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, through more efficient and effective solutions. We believe this is particularly compelling as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building management industries, some of which could grow by 50% or more over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have."

We took actions this quarter that, obviously, impacted this quarter, but we did that because we really wanted to accelerate both our growth capacity, our capacity to service the growth that we are seeing, and we'll continue to see, we believe, and number two, to drive productivity, so that we can continue to have the type of variable contribution margins that we expect. And what we expect, as we've said before, is kind of that mid- to upper 20s. It doesn't mean that we won't exceed it from time to time, but this quarter is a great example. In spite of the challenges that we had with some of the streamlining issues, we still delivered a 26%, 27% variable contribution margin. For the full year 2016, we were about 30%. So our expectation is, is that even as we anniversary the acquisitions, we'll still be in the very high rate while continuing to invest. And just to be clear, these numbers are pretty staggering. Acuity and its legacy business in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we added 100 people. We added 100 salaried people. We're investing heavily because we see huge growth coming our way. Over the last, literally, year, including acquisitions, we've added almost 700 salaried heads to our capabilities. This is an enormous capability. In the last quarter, we added almost 1,500 hourly people. Now that number will come down a little bit as we streamline the operations, but that really was what caused us to experience both labor shortages and just onboarding issues as we ramp up the business because, again, we see very, very robust growth. All this means as we think about 2017, our expectation is to continue to deliver a very robust variable contribution margin that is in that mid- to upper 20% range while investing in our business."

Some of those have diminished a bit from the rates we've seen in previous years, but continue to see pretty aggressive incentives being offered by the utility companies. And then there are some tax accelerated benefits as well. On the regulatory front, continue to see most of the states implementing building codes that mandate certain levels of efficiencies. Much of it is around the level of control of lights where you need to put occupancy sensors and take advantage of turning lights off when a room or a stairwell or an area is not being occupied. But as in the case of Title 24 in California, you're seeing many of them go beyond that and start mandating how much you're allowed to consume per square foot and the level of integration of the entire office power grid. So the regulatory front continues to move forward, and we see it as another catalyst for our growth."

But ultimately, we expect it to be a nice margin contributor because you've invested the cost. It's almost -- it's software related. So the margins that you come off of that should be very consistent with other companies providing those types of capabilities. So our expectation is that our gross profit margin will continue to improve over time. And we will be able to continue to leverage as we hit sort of a plateauing probably sometime in late 2017, early 2018 of some of these investments. And then the revenues that will be returning off of those will make those -- the percentage of SDA become smaller relative to where it is today. We finished the year on an adjusted basis with SDA about 26.9%, let's call it 27%. Margins at the gross profit level were about 43.7%. Again, our expectation is that our gross profit margins will continue to improve. And our SDA, we will continue to be able to leverage that. So the best way to think about our business is still in terms of variable contribution margin. We're still investing, though the investing is slowing down a tad because we have made significant investments in 2016. I would also say that when I look at our total costs for salaried associates as well as our total costs for hourly associates as a percentage of our sales, those things continue to be flattish. And so that's why you're again seeing margins improve over the 2015 time period, whether it be at operating profit or at the gross profit level. So we are getting the leverage. It's coming through the variable contribution margin. And yet, we're still investing heavily in our business, because, again, we see really tremendous growth opportunity over the next decade."

We knew we were going to have to free up some capacity in key manufacturing facilities. So we decided during the quarter to make that investment to accelerate those efforts. And so just the sheer act of ramping up and attracting talent into the organization, I'm talking about hourly talent, was a challenge, particularly in a couple of areas, because those areas are also experiencing growth from other companies moving into the market. We knew that was going to happen, we anticipated, but truthfully, as we were ramping up, the whole notion of the number of -- the sheer number of folks that we needed and then the training side of it resulted in us not wanting to ship product, because we wanted to make sure the quality was there and all of those issues. So we believe that we lost roughly $25 million. It's an estimate of lost orders and lost shipments during the quarter. And our guess is that -- it's just a guess -- that it probably cost us 70 bps of operating profit margin in total. So you can understand the magnitude, but we had to bite the bullet. We did it. We believe it's behind us. We think there may be some just carryover lingering effect as orders ramp back up. Our order rates suggest that it's behind us. Our productive output is pretty close back to where it was in terms of our efficiencies and our effectiveness. So we're not expecting any of the lingering issues to have a material impact on our first quarter results."

We do well in Tier 1 and 2 both from a sales perspective as well as a margin perspective. But the Tier 3 solutions, particularly those that are enabled or capable of enabling the Internet of Things, really are very exciting for us, and we see more and more people wanting to bring those together. And truthfully, this is why we introduced nLight ECLYPSE. It's a very, very powerful lighting, building, automation system that's come together in a way that is unified. So there's no steps that others have to take. You don't have to worry about whether the mechanical folks or whether the electrical folks are going to work together. That's the beauty of this solution set, and it can enable the Internet of Things. And so we believe that more and more folks, as the specifications cycle starts its normal routine, we believe that by midyear, you're going to see orders ramping up for these things. So again, this is what gives us confidence and optimism that we should be able to meaningfully outperform the growth rates of the markets that we generally serve."

No, our acquisition appetite is quite robust. Whenever you make acquisitions of companies that are add-ons, like Juno, for example, it just gives a company like Acuity, which is -- has a robust supply chain, the opportunity to leverage its efficiencies. And so sometimes, you have to move things around to be able to do that. You hope that they always go perfectly. I think we did a good job. We just caught a little bit of a perfect storm. Some of our main facilities are in locations where the growth rate is robust, because they're just great locations to be in. And so as we're ramping up the number of people I had mentioned earlier, just the whole notion of bringing people onboard, training them and facilitating all that was a challenge, but it was a temporary challenge. I think few companies have the skill and capability to do it as effectively and as efficiently as we've done. This was basically a 60-day, 90-day type issue where we've done some meaningful things that will have a huge impact on the profitability of our business going forward as well as our ability to serve customers and to expand into new markets. The Distech acquisition and its integration is moving along exceptionally well, because they continue to focus on their core businesses. The engineering departments are working together in a way to introduce solution sets like nLight ECLYPSE. That's never existed in the market before. We are meeting an unmet need. So -- and it will take a while for those sales to ramp up as the specifications cycle works its way through, as we train people, as people become acclimated to it. But no, our appetite for acquisitions continues. While I'm disappointed that we didn't -- we lost some revenues this quarter, I just am very pleased at how aggressively we attack these things, because we do see robust growth of not only the lighting side but the building management side. We see growth in the Juno product lines that they brought to us, and we see growth in the combination of Acuity and Juno. So we're very bullish about what we see on a go-forward basis."

We don't make many things that require heavy investment. We're a design and procurer and assembler of product to meet our specifications. So the investments that we have been making have really been to expand, if you will, our physical capacity in some areas because of the growth. Our electronics business is just on fire. It's doing an exceptional work, but -- so I don't see any technical obsolescence. As we think about the moves that we took in the fourth quarter, it was really about training people and bringing people onboard and then stabilizing that process. We added an enormous number of folks, as I had mentioned earlier in the call. So I think we have managed it exceedingly well. I wish we had managed it even better. Typically, we do these things and you, the shareholders, don't really see a blip. This time, it was pretty big. And so the consolidation of what we've done, we believe, will have huge benefits on a go-forward basis. So again, I don't really see much in the way of issues. It's training. It's development of our people. We're good at that. It just happened very, very quickly, because we've made the decision to accelerate, not go slow, but go quickly, because we believe that the growth, particularly on the installed base, renovation and retrofit activity, is a huge opportunity for Acuity. We've introduced some great new products and solution sets to really go after that market even more aggressively. So we're ramping up our capacity and we made the decision to do that in a location where it would have its permanent home, not do it in places where it would be temporary. So that's what caused us to want to accelerate this activity, because we see great future growth going forward."

That market, like really all markets, is based on features and benefits and capabilities of your solution set and how you have used technology and knowhow to create a difference.

So the notion of creating an industry standard is a little different in that we want to offer features and benefits where our eldoLED driver for many of our partners or friends, and we want to enable more, really provides a capability that is unmatched in the industry. So it's a solution set that people would identify with. And by virtue of its features and benefits, we would hope that they would prefer that over others and then, therefore, it becomes the driver of choice for many applications. As we think about the Internet of Things and how we enable more folks to participate, we want people to use our driver, so that it can be part of a holistic system and their capabilities, whatever they happen to be, can participate in a solution set that an architect, lighting designer, a building owner would like to have, including their luminaires. I wish I could tell you we make every luminaire known to man. We don't, and so our branding strategy is to get others that fill in gaps and have opportunities to participate on the overall system to be part of that digital backbone. And Acuity can then guarantee to the building owner that it's going to work and work the way they want, and it will do everything that they want. So that's really what we're driving towards."

So, Brian, the way we look at the market, as we say, there's new construction. And we all know how to do that. There's an architect, lighting designer, engineer, building owner, electrical contractor, electrical distributor involved. Next portion of the market is planned renovation. That's where someone again will hire architect, engineer, lighting designer. And they'll go after and they'll say, ""I'm going to remodel a wing of my house, it'll look great."" It looks like new construction to us. Then there's this world of what we call unplanned renovation. It's what exists out there every day. And you use your office every day, and you don't think about the lights that are above you. It's that world that we are looking to attack in a much more aggressive and holistic way, bringing them solutions that will cause them to say, ""Yes, I want to go from having analog lighting to digital lighting. Yes, I want to go from having an analog HVAC building management system to a digital building management system."" Our view is that the installed base, and I've given these statistics before, DOE estimates that there's 100 billion square feet of building space in the U.S. A few years ago, our guesstimate was that it was about $3 a square foot to convert: $2.50 a square foot for fixtures and another $0.50 a square foot for controls. We believe today that with our solution sets, the unified nLight ECLYPSE system, for example, the ability to enable Internet of Things to collect data off of this to provide many more features and benefits of data and what it can do in the space to help a building owner optimize what they're doing, is a unique and compelling value proposition. So the conversion of that installed base and the value of that installed base, we think, is much higher than what we had originally estimated, 2 or 3x higher. And then you put in that outdoor, which is another third the size of that. It's a huge marketplace. DOE also estimates that less than 15% of the outdoor market has been converted to date. Less than 5% of the indoor market has converted to date. We believe that to be true. I mean, just look in all offices, drive down the street, and you'll see the tremendous amount of opportunity. So what Acuity is doing and what investments that we have made in ramping up not only our headcount, but also the acquisitions that we've made, very strategic in nature, will give us capability to go after that installed base in a very aggressive way. It's equally applicable to new construction as well as planned renovation, but the unplanned renovation market that -- is huge, I mean, $800 billion or more than that. So that's what we're targeting as a growth opportunity. We continue to do well in new construction and planned renovation. We see opportunities for continued growth there. We think that we're taking share in that space, but where we think we can really turbocharge our business is to get after the unplanned renovation. And that's what gives us enthusiasm for outsized growth relative to the growth rates of the markets that we serve as well as being less dependent upon new construction by itself."

So LEDs today represent almost 2/3 of our total revenues, but I just want to emphasize that Acuity has revenues other than fixture products. Obviously, Distech; it's a simple example, but we also sell emergency lighting. We will sell poles for outdoor lighting. So when we think about where our mix actually is for our lighting business -- and we sell control systems, too, it is a much higher percentage than what it means to the overall sales. So ultimately, I see Acuity sales continuing to grow in multiple areas, including selling more luminaires. But I think LED as a percentage, I don't know what the exact number will be. But it will hit a fixed percentage, because we'll have been converted virtually all to LED within our luminaire business. I still think that, that is a few years away, but I believe it'll happen, particularly as LEDs just become more efficacious. But there are -- and they are doing that. So I think that for our business, I don't know what the exact percentage will be, because we sell other things, and we'll want to sell those other things. Those other items will continue to grow. I mean, our building management systems, which tie, now that we have nLight ECLYPSE, in a unified way with HVAC and other -- in lighting and so on and so forth, we expect that to grow fairly significantly. So it will continue as a percentage of the total, make LEDs -- we will hold their percentage to our total.

First, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in 2016. We achieved record results for virtually all financial metrics, including net sales, operating profit, diluted earnings per share and cash flow generation. For the full year and the fourth quarter, net sales grew approximately 22%, while sales volume, excluding acquisitions, was more than double the estimated mid-single-digit growth rates of the key markets we serve. In fact, this was the 14th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement that few companies can claim. 
We believe these results are yet again strong evidence our strategies to deliver superior returns to shareholders, provide customers with differentiated value-added solutions and diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative energy-efficient lighting and building management solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity. 
We achieved record profitability for the quarter and full year, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting and building management solutions portfolio, which affords us a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things. 
I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights.  First, for the quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a quarterly record of $926 million, an increase of 22% compared with the year-ago period. Our net sales could have been even higher, as I will explain later in the call.  Reported operating profit was $135.1 million compared with $111.8 million in the year-ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.89, a quarterly record compared with the $1.37 in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items, which Ricky will explain later in the call. 
Also our reported financial results included certain items, among others, such as share-based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments, including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangibles. Because many shareholders and analysts ask specific questions regarding these items, in order to make our results comparable between periods, we will continue to add back these items to our reported results to provide greater transparency and comparability. 
In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $156.5 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $123.6 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 27%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.9%, an increase of 60 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.21, up 27% from the year-ago period against strong quarterly results.
For the full year, net sales at Acuity were a record $3.3 billion, up 22% from 2015. Reported operating profit was $475 million in 2016 compared with $376 million in the year-ago period, while diluted earnings per share was $6.63, up 30% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit was $555 million in 2016, up 32% from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was a record 16.9%, up 130 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $7.84, up almost 35% from 2015. 
In addition, we generated a record $346 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year, up 20% from last year. We closed the year with $413 million of cash on hand, even after investing $623 million for acquisitions as well as $84 million in capital expenditures this year, leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our growth strategies. 
Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital. Our adjusted cash flow return on investment for 2016 was 34%, tying our all-time high even after the significant investments made this year. We believe this level of return is far in excess of others in the electrical industry. For those who follow EVA, we generated over $150 million in positive EVA, an astounding achievement.
To put our performance in perspective, I'd like to remind folks of 2 points. First, the nonresidential construction market, an important market for us, is still down about 15% on an inflation-adjusted basis from its peak in 2008, and yet, our net sales are up 65% since then. Second, we sold virtually no LED-based fixtures in 2008, and today, these solutions make up almost 2/3 of our net sales. We have invested significantly to make Acuity the leader in digital lighting, while at the same time delivering superior financial performance for our shareholders. 
While our record results for the quarter and the full year were significant improvements over the year-ago periods, they could have been even better. We would like to provide you with more color on our results for the quarter and the year.  
Net sales and profitability for the fourth quarter were all-time quarterly records. However, as I said, our results could have been even greater and here's why. During the quarter, we made the decision to accelerate certain actions to streamline our supply chain, enhance our customer service and drive productivity. These actions included, among others, the closure of a manufacturing location and the transfer of certain production to alternate locations in order to free up additional capacity for future growth and to better leverage our overall supply chain. These actions overlap with the ramping up of a new production facility and the addition of a new paint line. The combination of these actions created labor shortages in certain locations, which negatively impacted production and shipments, which resulted in canceled orders as well as added costs. We estimate these short-term labor issues resulted in canceled orders and lost contribution and more than $25 million of net sales and caused us to incur additional overtime and other costs in excess of $2 million in the quarter. We're not going to attempt to quantify the impact of these labor shortages had on our fourth quarter results beyond what I noted just now. Please know the actions implemented this quarter will provide significant benefits to our business as we go forward. While the impact of these labor issues is mostly behind us, we may experience some modest carryover effect into our first quarter, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results.
Looking more closely at the fourth quarter, net sales grew 22% compared with the year-ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew an impressive 13%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points, while changes in price/mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point, respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on light kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain component costs and, to a lesser degree, changes in the mix of products sold. The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for almost 2/3 of our total net sales, as you know, includes the sale of nonfixture-related products and solutions as well.
Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces, have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments. Our profitability measures for the fourth quarter were outstanding, even while absorbing the impact of the supply chain streamlining actions I noted earlier and the continued investments in areas of growth, such as our unified lighting and building management platform and our IoT capabilities. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating profit was $156.5 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.9% and just shy of our quarterly record of 17.2%, but up 60 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was 43.5%, up 120 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout most of the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno, which in its recent past has had lower gross profit margin than Acuity as well as a short-term impact of the supply chain streamlining actions taken during the quarter.
Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter, were up $48.1 million or 24%. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.6% in the current quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of acquisitions and higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy. 
This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our fourth quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, excluding the impact of acquisitions. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 26%, well within our current target of mid- to upper 20s. All in all, we had another great quarter.
The story was much the same for the full year's record sales results -- full year record results in 2016. Net sales grew 22% this year. Excluding acquisitions, our net sales grew over 13% while sales volume grew over 15%, more than 2x the estimated growth rate of our addressable market. Adjusted gross profit margin was a record 43.7%, up 140 basis points compared with the prior year's gross profit margin. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.9% improved 130 basis points over 2015. Our adjusted variable contribution margin for the full year, excluding acquisitions, was almost 30%, even while we invested aggressively in areas which represent exciting growth opportunities. Again, we had another great year.
On the strategic front in 2016, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be a strong growth in profitability in 2017 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our Lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as our building management platform. With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than 3x as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls that also support building management and IoT applications. 
Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy, winning accolades from customers and numerous industry awards this year for introducing solutions never seen before. In fact, Forbes Magazine recently recognized Acuity Brands in its top 100 most innovative companies list. No other lighting company or building management company made this exclusive list. This is a remarkable achievement for our extraordinary associates. And remember, this is from a company with longtime industry-leading brands, one of which has been in existence for almost 120 years.
Additionally, we continued to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy, which consist of 4 tier levels. As we have noted before, the purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be single device, which we categorize as Tier 1, or a complete holistic integrated lighting and building management solution, which we refer to as Tier 3, for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between. We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple, both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri, DGLogik and Juno in 2016 have meaningfully enhanced our industry-leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. 
While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic, integrated solutions were up almost 40% this year over 2015 and now represent more than 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity through the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional recurring revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solutions.
To fully execute our holistic tiered solutions strategy, we have continued to hone our organizational structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year, including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salaried headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy.
In fact, our salaried headcount is up over 30% from 1 year earlier and that includes acquisitions. Few other companies, if any, have been able to make this kind of investment while delivering upper quartile financial performance like Acuity. 
Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best can control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment, while realizing additional benefits, including energy and maintenance savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, and with the additions of Distech, Juno, DGLogik and Geometri, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.
At Acuity, we're not just talking the Internet of Things, we are doing it. As I noted last quarter, we had converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including global leading retailers and certain other customers, to smart lighting solutions. As part of their smart lighting solution platform, we had more than 200,000 maintenance-free beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with a superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful actionable information. Importantly, we are on a path to almost quadruple this installed base by the end of calendar 2016. We believe this level of capability in deployment is unmatched in our industry. 
Integration of Distech, which operates in its historical markets as more of a standalone company, continues to move along very well. We expect the combination of Distech and Acuity with our broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic, unified solutions that deliver true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.
As an integral part of this strategy, we just introduced nLight ECLYPSE, a powerful, cost-effective capability that enhances our industry-leading controls -- lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solutions that unify lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines our building programming, facilitates our smart multizone daylight harvesting and color tuning capabilities and enhanced IoT access. We believe the capabilities and ease in installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity is driving the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities, and we are just getting started.
We expect our recent strategic acquisitions, coupled with our aggressive internal investments, will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We've been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now almost 12,000 associates, who are maniacally focused on serving and solving and supporting the needs of our customers. 
I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our market expectations for the construction markets later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2017. Ricky?"
1413208,384005193,1053477,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance",795,"Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year performance on virtually all metrics, including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance and not repeat the information already provided by Vern.
As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2016 and 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily, due to the impact of the 4 acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets; share-based compensation expense since we used restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of the shareholders; special charges as we streamlined and integrated recent acquisitions; and an impairment of intangible assets as we rationalized acquired trade names. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. 
In addition, many of our peer companies, especially as we become more of a technology company, make these same adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.
During the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $4.9 million and $15 million, respectively, for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities included the consolidation of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. 
We realized net savings in excess of $4 million in fiscal year 2016 and expect to achieve annual savings of twice the amount of the special charge, or approximately $30 million, and we believe we'll be at this run rate by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
We anticipate incurring additional costs associated with further integration activities of recent acquisitions in fiscal year 2017, although the amount and exact timing has not yet been determined.
During the fourth quarter, we finalized our allocation of the purchase price for the Distech acquisition and refined the preliminary allocations for Juno, Geometri and DGLogik acquisitions. Consequently, we reduced our fourth quarter acquisition-related amortization expense by $4.4 million from the amount recorded in the third quarter. We expect to finalize the remaining purchase price allocations by the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our current estimate is that acquisition-related amortization expense will be approximately $5.8 million per quarter in fiscal year 2017. To provide full transparency of this noncash cost, we will continue to quantify this amount each quarter as part of our adjusted results. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.8% compared with 35% in the fourth quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to once again be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
We did an excellent job this year of managing operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital was 38 days, which we believe is industry leading. 
In fiscal year 2016, we spent $83.7 million on capital expenditures compared with $56.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics and painting capacity and build-outs of our innovation and technology center and a new production facility, which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.
At August 31, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $413.2 million, a decrease of $343.6 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease was due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $623.2 million and the capital expenditures of $83.7 million as well as the paid dividends to shareholders of $22.9 million. 
Our total debt outstanding was $355.2 million at August 31, 2016, and we had more cash than debt at the year-end. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at August 31, 2016, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility, and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern."
1413208,384005193,1053477,"Acuity Brands, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Acuity Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe contin",1055,"Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall, the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe continue to move along in a measured, but sometimes inconsistent pace. This year's presidential election in the U.S. and events such as U.K.'s referendum vote to exit the European Union continue to create uncertainty and volatility. This uncertainty and volatility always has the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment, which in turn could negatively impact global economic activity. 
That notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for the continued -- for continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observations for 2017.
First, we estimate the broad lighting market in North America, which represents 97% of our total net sales, will grow in the mid- to upper single-digit range in fiscal 2017, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation and retrofit activity. Again, the favorable trend in our September order rates seems to support this continued level of improvement. 
Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American market, such as the Architectural Billing Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, and steel costs, which we continue -- which we expect to continue to rise, we do not anticipate significant changes in other material and component costs over the next 12 months. 
We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising health care costs. 
Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are always unpredictable. 
Another observation. While our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix as well as current dilutive -- the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as sales volume grows, as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost savings related to recent actions taken to accelerate the integration of acquisitions made in 2016. Our record adjusted gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential. It is a very positive picture.
Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation. 
Lastly and most importantly, we expect our overall growth rate to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve.  
Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building management solutions that, for example, connect smart devices with smartphones for many different end users as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities. We are experiencing strong interest from many of our customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base of connected devices by the end of calendar 2016.
As we have noted in our last several conference calls, implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from our acquisitions of Distech, Geometri and DGLogik, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add significantly greater broad-based holistic solutions, allowing customers to optimize the performance of their facilities. While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates of our Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories as well as the implementation of our IoT solutions. 
Further, the addition of Juno has meaningfully expanded and strengthened our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhancing our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. We are still in the early stages of fully optimizing the potential of Juno as part of our portfolio. 
Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength, to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast-changing industry because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. 
Our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and, more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, through more efficient and effective solutions. We believe this is particularly compelling as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building management industries, some of which could grow by 50% or more over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have."

In spite of the challenges that we had with some of the streamlining issues, we still delivered a 26%, 27% variable contribution margin. For the full year 2016, we were about 30%. So our expectation is, is that even as we anniversary the acquisitions, we'll still be in the very high rate while continuing to invest. And just to be clear, these numbers are pretty staggering. Acuity and its legacy business in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we added 100 people. We added 100 salaried people. We're investing heavily because we see huge growth coming our way. Over the last, literally, year, including acquisitions, we've added almost 700 salaried heads to our capabilities. This is an enormous capability. In the last quarter, we added almost 1,500 hourly people. Now that number will come down a little bit as we streamline the operations, but that really was what caused us to experience both labor shortages and just onboarding issues as we ramp up the business because, again, we see very, very robust growth. All this means as we think about 2017, our expectation is to continue to deliver a very robust variable contribution margin that is in that mid- to upper 20% range while investing in our business."

And as you might imagine, it's been more lucrative in the higher-cost areas of both coasts, East Coast as well as West Coast. Some of those have diminished a bit from the rates we've seen in previous years, but continue to see pretty aggressive incentives being offered by the utility companies. And then there are some tax accelerated benefits as well. On the regulatory front, continue to see most of the states implementing building codes that mandate certain levels of efficiencies. Much of it is around the level of control of lights where you need to put occupancy sensors and take advantage of turning lights off when a room or a stairwell or an area is not being occupied. But as in the case of Title 24 in California, you're seeing many of them go beyond that and start mandating how much you're allowed to consume per square foot and the level of integration of the entire office power grid. So the regulatory front continues to move forward, and we see it as another catalyst for our growth."

Well, you're seeing our margins continue to improve for a number of reasons: one, incremental volume; number two, the mix as we migrate more to -- migrate as the percentage of what Tier 3 and Tier 4 is de minimus right now. But ultimately, we expect it to be a nice margin contributor because you've invested the cost. It's almost -- it's software related. So the margins that you come off of that should be very consistent with other companies providing those types of capabilities. So our expectation is that our gross profit margin will continue to improve over time. And we will be able to continue to leverage as we hit sort of a plateauing probably sometime in late 2017, early 2018 of some of these investments. And then the revenues that will be returning off of those will make those -- the percentage of SDA become smaller relative to where it is today. We finished the year on an adjusted basis with SDA about 26.9%, let's call it 27%. Margins at the gross profit level were about 43.7%. Again, our expectation is that our gross profit margins will continue to improve. And our SDA, we will continue to be able to leverage that. So the best way to think about our business is still in terms of variable contribution margin. We're still investing, though the investing is slowing down a tad because we have made significant investments in 2016. I would also say that when I look at our total costs for salaried associates as well as our total costs for hourly associates as a percentage of our sales, those things continue to be flattish. And so that's why you're again seeing margins improve over the 2015 time period, whether it be at operating profit or at the gross profit level. So we are getting the leverage. It's coming through the variable contribution margin. And yet, we're still investing heavily in our business, because, again, we see really tremendous growth opportunity over the next decade."

The September order rate for Acuity is meaningfully outperforming the industry, as we pointed out. Number two, your first question, the issue was we knew we were going to have to accelerate the consolidation of some of our manufacturing capabilities. We knew we were going to have to free up some capacity in key manufacturing facilities. So we decided during the quarter to make that investment to accelerate those efforts. And so just the sheer act of ramping up and attracting talent into the organization, I'm talking about hourly talent, was a challenge, particularly in a couple of areas, because those areas are also experiencing growth from other companies moving into the market. We knew that was going to happen, we anticipated, but truthfully, as we were ramping up, the whole notion of the number of -- the sheer number of folks that we needed and then the training side of it resulted in us not wanting to ship product, because we wanted to make sure the quality was there and all of those issues. So we believe that we lost roughly $25 million. It's an estimate of lost orders and lost shipments during the quarter. And our guess is that -- it's just a guess -- that it probably cost us 70 bps of operating profit margin in total. So you can understand the magnitude, but we had to bite the bullet. We did it. We believe it's behind us. We think there may be some just carryover lingering effect as orders ramp back up. Our order rates suggest that it's behind us. Our productive output is pretty close back to where it was in terms of our efficiencies and our effectiveness. So we're not expecting any of the lingering issues to have a material impact on our first quarter results."

So there's no steps that others have to take. You don't have to worry about whether the mechanical folks or whether the electrical folks are going to work together.

No, our acquisition appetite is quite robust. Whenever you make acquisitions of companies that are add-ons, like Juno, for example, it just gives a company like Acuity, which is -- has a robust supply chain, the opportunity to leverage its efficiencies. And so sometimes, you have to move things around to be able to do that. You hope that they always go perfectly. I think we did a good job. We just caught a little bit of a perfect storm. Some of our main facilities are in locations where the growth rate is robust, because they're just great locations to be in. And so as we're ramping up the number of people I had mentioned earlier, just the whole notion of bringing people onboard, training them and facilitating all that was a challenge, but it was a temporary challenge. I think few companies have the skill and capability to do it as effectively and as efficiently as we've done. This was basically a 60-day, 90-day type issue where we've done some meaningful things that will have a huge impact on the profitability of our business going forward as well as our ability to serve customers and to expand into new markets. The Distech acquisition and its integration is moving along exceptionally well, because they continue to focus on their core businesses. The engineering departments are working together in a way to introduce solution sets like nLight ECLYPSE. That's never existed in the market before. We are meeting an unmet need. So -- and it will take a while for those sales to ramp up as the specifications cycle works its way through, as we train people, as people become acclimated to it. But no, our appetite for acquisitions continues. While I'm disappointed that we didn't -- we lost some revenues this quarter, I just am very pleased at how aggressively we attack these things, because we do see robust growth of not only the lighting side but the building management side. We see growth in the Juno product lines that they brought to us, and we see growth in the combination of Acuity and Juno. So we're very bullish about what we see on a go-forward basis."

We don't make many things that require heavy investment. We're a design and procurer and assembler of product to meet our specifications. So the investments that we have been making have really been to expand, if you will, our physical capacity in some areas because of the growth. Our electronics business is just on fire. It's doing an exceptional work, but -- so I don't see any technical obsolescence. As we think about the moves that we took in the fourth quarter, it was really about training people and bringing people onboard and then stabilizing that process. We added an enormous number of folks, as I had mentioned earlier in the call. So I think we have managed it exceedingly well. I wish we had managed it even better. Typically, we do these things and you, the shareholders, don't really see a blip. This time, it was pretty big. And so the consolidation of what we've done, we believe, will have huge benefits on a go-forward basis. So again, I don't really see much in the way of issues. It's training. It's development of our people. We're good at that. It just happened very, very quickly, because we've made the decision to accelerate, not go slow, but go quickly, because we believe that the growth, particularly on the installed base, renovation and retrofit activity, is a huge opportunity for Acuity. We've introduced some great new products and solution sets to really go after that market even more aggressively. So we're ramping up our capacity and we made the decision to do that in a location where it would have its permanent home, not do it in places where it would be temporary.

So it's a solution set that people would identify with. And by virtue of its features and benefits, we would hope that they would prefer that over others and then, therefore, it becomes the driver of choice for many applications. As we think about the Internet of Things and how we enable more folks to participate, we want people to use our driver, so that it can be part of a holistic system and their capabilities, whatever they happen to be, can participate in a solution set that an architect, lighting designer, a building owner would like to have, including their luminaires. I wish I could tell you we make every luminaire known to man. We don't, and so our branding strategy is to get others that fill in gaps and have opportunities to participate on the overall system to be part of that digital backbone. And Acuity can then guarantee to the building owner that it's going to work and work the way they want, and it will do everything that they want. So that's really what we're driving towards."

So, Brian, the way we look at the market, as we say, there's new construction. And we all know how to do that. There's an architect, lighting designer, engineer, building owner, electrical contractor, electrical distributor involved. Next portion of the market is planned renovation. That's where someone again will hire architect, engineer, lighting designer. And they'll go after and they'll say, ""I'm going to remodel a wing of my house, it'll look great."" It looks like new construction to us. Then there's this world of what we call unplanned renovation. It's what exists out there every day. And you use your office every day, and you don't think about the lights that are above you. It's that world that we are looking to attack in a much more aggressive and holistic way, bringing them solutions that will cause them to say, ""Yes, I want to go from having analog lighting to digital lighting. Yes, I want to go from having an analog HVAC building management system to a digital building management system."" Our view is that the installed base, and I've given these statistics before, DOE estimates that there's 100 billion square feet of building space in the U.S. A few years ago, our guesstimate was that it was about $3 a square foot to convert: $2.50 a square foot for fixtures and another $0.50 a square foot for controls. We believe today that with our solution sets, the unified nLight ECLYPSE system, for example, the ability to enable Internet of Things to collect data off of this to provide many more features and benefits of data and what it can do in the space to help a building owner optimize what they're doing, is a unique and compelling value proposition. So the conversion of that installed base and the value of that installed base, we think, is much higher than what we had originally estimated, 2 or 3x higher. And then you put in that outdoor, which is another third the size of that. It's a huge marketplace. DOE also estimates that less than 15% of the outdoor market has been converted to date. Less than 5% of the indoor market has converted to date. We believe that to be true. I mean, just look in all offices, drive down the street, and you'll see the tremendous amount of opportunity. So what Acuity is doing and what investments that we have made in ramping up not only our headcount, but also the acquisitions that we've made, very strategic in nature, will give us capability to go after that installed base in a very aggressive way. It's equally applicable to new construction as well as planned renovation, but the unplanned renovation market that -- is huge, I mean, $800 billion or more than that. So that's what we're targeting as a growth opportunity. We continue to do well in new construction and planned renovation. We see opportunities for continued growth there. We think that we're taking share in that space, but where we think we can really turbocharge our business is to get after the unplanned renovation. And that's what gives us enthusiasm for outsized growth relative to the growth rates of the markets that we serve as well as being less dependent upon new construction by itself."

So when we think about where our mix actually is for our lighting business -- and we sell control systems, too, it is a much higher percentage than what it means to the overall sales. So ultimately, I see Acuity sales continuing to grow in multiple areas, including selling more luminaires. But I think LED as a percentage, I don't know what the exact number will be. But it will hit a fixed percentage, because we'll have been converted virtually all to LED within our luminaire business. I still think that, that is a few years away, but I believe it'll happen, particularly as LEDs just become more efficacious. But there are -- and they are doing that. So I think that for our business, I don't know what the exact percentage will be, because we sell other things, and we'll want to sell those other things. Those other items will continue to grow. I mean, our building management systems, which tie, now that we have nLight ECLYPSE, in a unified way with HVAC and other -- in lighting and so on and so forth, we expect that to grow fairly significantly. So it will continue as a percentage of the total, make LEDs -- we will hold their percentage to our total. And there will be other technologies that will come out there that won't be directly LED that we'll also continue to sell, and they'll be a small portion of our business as well."
