In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 20",694,"Thank you, John. In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
As a result of both disciplined operational management and a benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, we achieved GAAP EPS of $1.28 per share, well above our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16; and non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 per share, also well above our guidance of $1.58 to $1.61. Product revenue of $234.7 million in the first quarter was down 2.6% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue. Service revenue of $254.8 million grew 14.9% year-over-year and represented 52% of total revenue.
Accounting for 55% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 3.8% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015. EMEA, which represented 26% of revenue, grew 9.3% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 15% of revenue and grew 7.5% year-over-year; and Japan revenue, representing 5% of total, grew 4.3% from a year ago. Sales to enterprise customers represented 62% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23% and government sales were 14%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal.
In Q1, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which represented 19.7% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.6%; Avnet, representing 13.9%; and Aero, which accounted for 11%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses of $272.9 million were within our target range of $268 million to $277 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $238.3 million. GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.3%.
Reflecting the one-time benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 32.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 30.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was a record $203.9 million. In Q1, we repurchased just under 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.94 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.175 billion in cash and investments.
DSO at the end of Q1 was 51 days. Inventories were $33.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $837.5 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately 4,275 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter.
Moving on to our Q2 outlook. With an increasingly uncertain macro environment, we believe it is prudent to take a conservative approach to our outlook for the current quarter. Our revenue target for the second quarter is $480 million to $490 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be at or around 82.5%, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%.
For Q2, we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $272 million to $281 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.61 to $1.64 per share.
We plan to increase our headcount by at least 50 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be greater than $125 million, reflecting the impact of 2 federal tax payments that we normally incur during our fiscal second quarter.
We remain confident in the competitive strength of our product portfolio, our expanding footprint and security, and our strategic position for the emerging cloud opportunity. We expect that these factors, combined with improving sales execution, our upcoming new product introductions and platform refreshes will enable us to reaccelerate our top line growth in the back half of fiscal 2016 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 6% with strong profitability and operating margins, resulting in an all-time high cash flow from operations above $200 million.
From a sales perspective, EMEA, Japan and our Asia Pacific region all delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth. EMEA and Asia both delivered record high sales bookings. Sales bookings in our Americas region were down year-over-year in Q1, as we experienced delays in closing several forecasted transactions in the U.S., especially toward to the and of the quarter. However, I was pleased to see that sales transactions above $1 million remained solid in the Americas during the quarter.
Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability, along with a healthy sequential 7% increase in deferred revenue. Overall, deferred revenue grew 23% year-over-year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business.
Our Good-Better-Best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our overall product revenues. Customer adoption of the best category remains very strong. And in Q1, we continued to see year-over-year growth in sales across all regions with the highest GDP growth coming from our EMEA and APAC customers.
I was also encouraged by our software revenue in the quarter. We continue to see more than 1/3 of product revenue coming from software sales driven by security module sales. GBB and software only VE solutions. We had several wins in the quarter where customers are deploying our APM security module to ensure access security for their applications that have migrated into the public cloud environment. With the option to bring your own license or rent utility licenses by the year, we offer flexible application services in the public clouds to some of our largest existing enterprise customers, as well as new smaller companies who have never used F5 before.
Security continues to be the key growth driver of our business. Million dollar plus security deals grew year-over-year in sales and volume in Q1 with EMEA delivering a record quarter in security sales. Deal volume for Silverline, our cloud-based subscription D-DOS and WAP security services was up double digits quarter-over-quarter and new bookings were up significantly year-over-year.
We're also starting to see business opportunities for Silverline services across all global regions with wins in EMEA and APAC this quarter. Our Silverline cloud-based subscription is clearly in the early stages of adoption and the revenue numbers are still relatively modest. However, we believe that a real growth opportunity for Silverline subscription services, and we will continue to invest in this opportunity by adding inside sales resources and offering more solutions to the Silverline portfolio.
The security team continues to innovate and add significant malware detection capabilities to protecting and strength like remote access promotions, across 8, scripting attacks and phishing attacks. In Q1, we had good wins with our WebSafe product, including 2 notable marquee wins in the banking vertical. 
Our client list solution continues to interest enterprise security buyers. And recent attacks, such as the pervasive dial malware phishing scheme, has received much attention. We detect and inoculate against this type of threat with our declining customers to deploy client-based applications and without acquiring them to modify their existing applications. As a result are much lower cost and faster time to benefit.
Fiscal Cisco ACE replacement continues to be an important source of product revenue in the quarter with some large million dollar plus wins. The program also continues to boost our channel with over 1/4 of the deals driven by our partners in Q1.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million this quarter. In the context of several global microeconomic issues, we delivered solid financial results in Q1. But as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term.
As I analyze our business and growth prospects, I have absolute confidence in our strategy to meet the current and future demands of the market. We are focused on expanding our core ADC and cloud solutions to increase the sizable marketing in areas like SSL inspection, as well as capturing hybrid and public cloud opportunities. In security, we will expand our focus on areas like the Gi firewall application protection and identity and access management.
We will continue to grow and expand our Silverline platform and subscription revenue. We will increase our vertical focus on the service provider market and drive repeatability with our Gi firewall, Gi line services, FV solutions and take advantage of our scalability and performance leadership with products like the new 100 gig blade addition to the VIPRION chassis. 
We will continue to improve customer experience by delivering comprehensive management solutions with our big IQ management and orchestration platform. We will leverage our strong partner ecosystem with leading vendors such as Cisco, HP, Microsoft and VMware in areas like SDN, as well as OpenStack environments. Finally, we will leverage our global services organization to drive product revenue sales while delivering world-class profitability and world-class customer satisfaction.
We have no shortage of business drivers for the second half of fiscal 2016. Our roadmap includes several new additions to our system and appliance range of product, as well as significant software deliverables designed to increase our addressable market. We have the following deliverables currently target for next quarter.
We have a new high-performance, fit suppliance based on the BIG-IP 10,000 series appliances. It uses next-generation technology, enabling an 8x improvement in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core requirements in the financial services market. We are targeting the release of a new high-performance 100 gig blade for the high end VIPRION series platforms next quarter. This new VIPRION includes 100 gig interfaces and more than doubles the performance of the existing cards to enable the first ever terabyte class ADC in the market.
The new blade runs all TMOS module and is targeted at system providers, applications including Gi firewall, sound and intelligent [indiscernible]. We have already seen strong interest from the Tier 1 service providers for the 100 gig product, and we are currently testing a Tier 1 customer environment.
We will be delivering F5 next generation iRules called iRules LX. IRules LX allows for users to leverage no GS libraries to provide new functionality addressing the needs of the Dev Ops market, as well as custom applications that need customization and programmability. IRules LX is based in the technology and is now fully integrated into TMOS.
We also plan to introduce iApps LX, which allows for easy programming of specific use cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used the publication programming language, JavaScript. IApps LX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN products as it allows these use cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ into the various SDN controllers, such as Cisco, APEC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature, which should give F5 a clear advantage with our SDN partners. We plan to release our Web application firewall in as sooner this quarter -- next quarter.
This will be available as part of the answer is service catalog and leverages iApps LX to significantly simplify WAF services management in the Azzure public cloud. We plan to ship release 5.0 of BIG-IQ next quarter. We have already made significant improvement in this skill ability of BIG-IQ in terms of managing hundreds of thousands of users. Release 5 now include centralized management for all security products, including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi firewall and WebSafe antifraud. It adds new device management capabilities, ADC management and application analytics. 
Starting next quarter, we plan to extend our product portfolio by adding purpose built security products, which will address new markets. The initial releases will include an SSL intercept and an SSL air GAAP solution followed by a standalone DDoS of should with the new behavioral and threat intelligence capabilities in Q4. In addition, the product -- in addition to the product deliverables I have discussed for Q3, we have the following product deliverables targeted for Q4.
A comprehensive appliance refresh will start this summer, placing all great places before the end of the calendar you. The new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improve price performance and will include our FPGA-based architecture, allowing for all software modules, including VCMP, to run across the entire product lineup.
Furthermore, during fiscal year 2017, we will enhance the shuttle series to offer a new hybrid capabilities in the hardware that allow for seamless connectivity between the data center, private cloud and the various F5 supported public clouds. We are also working hard to release a 40 gig capable version of our software VE solution to support NFV applications for service providers at high-end enterprises. We plan to issue a demo of this at Mobile World Congress in February with a production release at the end of the fiscal year. We partnered very closely with Intel in this development and assured an early version last year at the Intel Developers Forum.
I continue to believe that F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. Our hybrid application services strategy resonates well with existing and effective customers. Our hybrid application services strategy was reinforced by a recent survey we did of over 3.000 global customers. 10 or more application services are used by well over half of the respondents, who recognize that slow, unresponsive and unsecured applications can have a substantial negative impact in their business. In addition, the vast majority of these respondents indicated the plan to indicate hybrid plant architecture the future, which clearly endorses of the F5 hybrid cloud strategy.
The strategy is in place and our focus is on execution and strategy with an absolute priority in delivering product revenue growth. I summarized several business drivers, which will be available in the second half of fiscal 2016, and we new have every intention of taking advantage of these business growth drivers.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and our customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll hand the call over for Q&A."

And what we wanted to do is to take our functionality of differentiate that by essentially packaging database that smart consumable by these centers. So for example, DDoS. We provide a comprehensive DDoS solution both for on premises, as well as in Silverline. And we now connect of this, but we want to make it easier know for someone that to take that prompt solution configured get the benefits of it without getting the full ADC configuration. Same thing for things like air gap and in our core proxy service that we see that these things are difficult to configure sometimes when you start looking at the full Sears of what an ADC does and want to make that easier because of a target of these applications there's other ones would like to be able to do that read, and we want to increase the value of this bike including like analytics and other things that we can differentiate, say, from our Good-Better-Best offerings. So just allows us precise better targeting it also allows us to contact to say this again existing solutions in the market versus trying larger compositional aren't ADC levels agrees. So it's really more just being able to build on top of what we've already done, but differentiate it with the platform. In terms of the first question on competition. We hadn't really seen a big change in the terms of our traditional competitors. Citrix still kind of sitting in there. We didn't see any real change in terms of lost wins or anything like that. In fact, in the field, we generally hear that they've -- the competitive is down. They same other small, they pop up here and there. The municipal on price and then lower functionality than me target specific accounts. But general body, we haven't really seen any changes to there. In this kind of a next-generation these kind of cloud based ones that are coming up here and there. It really haven't seen much of there. Some mice out in the market, a little bit here and there that we see. But in terms of like account wins, there's been a number of large customer accounts made where we've actually seen a pop-up and then leave. We've been able to in those. So it hasn't been a really change for us in terms of business. Obviously, with cloud, Amazon, for example, they have kind of a very low end, low balance that they use to provide very basic services. But Amazon is a big partner of ours. And we do quite a bit of business with -- providing several of our products into their cloud. So same with Microsoft and is or. So with the cloud, there's opportunities and small threats by quite frankly, we don't see any different in the environment that we've seen in the past."

It's not that we've set by and say, ""Oh, my goodness, we need to worry from our TMOS platform to [indiscernible] we haven't done that at all."" In fact, when you look at what we're doing were doing VIPRION with a very good gets of the opposite and when you look at the overall refresh us, we're very much in the same vein as have been before."

In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 20",695,"Thank you, John. In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
As a result of both disciplined operational management and the benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, we achieved GAAP EPS of $1.28 per share, well above our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 per share, also well above our guidance of $1.58 to $1.61.
Product revenue of $234.7 million in the first quarter was down 2.6% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue. Service revenue of $254.8 million grew 14.9% year-over-year and represented 52% of total revenue.
Accounting for 55% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 3.8% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015. EMEA, which represented 26% of revenue, grew 9.3% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 15% of revenue and grew 7.5% year-over-year; and Japan revenue, representing 5% of total, grew 4.3% from a year ago. Sales to enterprise customers represented 62% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23% and government sales were 14%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal.
In Q1, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which represented 19.7% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.6%; Avnet representing 13.9%; and Aero, which accounted for 11%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses of $272.9 million were within our target range of $268 million to $277 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $238.3 million.
GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.3%. Reflecting the onetime benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 32.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 30.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was a record $203.9 million. In Q1, we repurchased just under 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.94 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.175 billion in cash and investments.
DSO at the end of Q1 was 51 days. Inventories were $33.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $837.5 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately 4,275 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter.
Moving on to our Q2 outlook. With an increasingly uncertain macro environment, we believe it is prudent to take a conservative approach to our outlook for the current quarter. Our revenue target for the second quarter is $480 million to $490 million.
GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be at or around 82.5%, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%.
For Q2, we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $272 million to $281 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.61 to $1.64 per share.
We plan to increase our headcount by at least 50 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be greater than $125 million, reflecting the impact of 2 federal tax payments that we normally incur during our fiscal second quarter.
We remain confident in the competitive strength of our product portfolio, our expanding footprint and security, and our strategic position for the emerging cloud opportunity. We expect that these factors, combined with improving sales execution, our upcoming new product introductions and platform refreshes will enable us to reaccelerate our top line growth in the back half of fiscal 2016 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2016.

I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 6% with strong profitability and operating margins, resulting in an all-time high cash flow from operations above $200 million.
From a sales perspective, EMEA, Japan and our Asia Pacific region all delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth. EMEA and Asia, both delivered record high sales bookings. Sales bookings in our Americas region were down year-over-year in Q1, as we experienced delays in closing several forecasted transactions in the U.S., especially towards to the and of the quarter. However, I was pleased to see that sales transactions above $1 million remained solid in the Americas during the quarter.
Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability, along with a healthy sequential 7% increase in deferred revenue. Overall, deferred revenue grew 23% year-over-year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business.
Our Good, Better, Best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our overall product revenues. Customer adoption of the best category remains very strong. And in Q1, we continued to see year-over-year growth in sales across all regions with the highest GBB growth coming from our EMEA and APAC customers.
I was also encouraged by our software revenue in the quarter. We continued to see more than 1/3 of product revenue coming from software sales driven by security module sales. GBB and software-only VE solutions. We had several wins in the quarter, where customers are deploying our APM security module to ensure access security for their applications that have migrated into the public cloud environment. With the option to bring your own license or rent utility licenses by the other, we offer flexible application services in the public clouds to some of our largest existing enterprise customers, as well as new smaller companies who have never used F5 before.
Security continues to be the key growth driver of our business. Million dollar plus security deals grew year-over-year in size and volume in Q1 with EMEA delivering a record quarter in security sales. Deal volume for Silverline, our cloud-based subscription DDoS and WAP security services was up double digits quarter-over-quarter and new bookings were up significantly year-over-year.
We're also starting to see business opportunities for Silverline services across all global regions with wins in EMEA and APAC this quarter. Our Silverline cloud-based subscription is clearly in the early stages of adoption and the revenue numbers are still relatively modest. However, we believe that a real growth opportunity for Silverline subscription services, and we will continue to invest in this opportunity by adding inside sales resources and offering more solutions to the Silverline portfolio.
The security team continues to innovate and add significant malware detection capabilities to protect against threats like remote access, trojans, cross-site scripting attacks and phishing attacks. In Q1, we had good wins with our WebSafe product, including 2 notable marquee wins in the banking vertical. 
Our client list solution continues to interest enterprise security buyers. And recent attacks, such as the pervasive dial malware phishing scheme, has received much attention. We detect and inoculate against this type of threat with our declining customers to deploy client-based applications and without acquiring them to modify their existing applications. As a result, a much lower cost and faster time to benefit.
Cisco ACE replacements continue to be an important source of product revenue in the quarter with some large million dollar plus wins. The program also continues to boost our channel with over 1/4 of the deals driven by our partners in Q1.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million this quarter. In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered solid financial results in Q1. But as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term.
As I analyze our business and growth prospects, I have absolute confidence in our strategy to meet the current and future demands of the market. We are focused on expanding our core ADC and cloud solutions to increase the size of our marketing in areas like SSL inspection as well as capturing hybrid and public cloud opportunities. In security, we will extend our focus on areas like the Gi firewall, application protection, and identity and access management.
We will continue to grow and expand our Silverline platform and subscription revenue. We will increase our vertical focus on the service provider market and drive repeatability with our Gi firewall, Gi LAN services, NFV solutions and take advantage of our scalability and performance leadership with products like the new 100-gig blade addition to the VIPRION chassis. 
We will continue to improve customer experience by delivering comprehensive management solutions with our BIG-IQ management and orchestration platform. We will leverage our strong partner ecosystem with leading vendors, such as Cisco, HP, Microsoft and VMware in areas like SDN as well as OpenStack environments.
Finally, we will leverage our global services organization to drive product revenue sales while delivering world-class profitability and world-class customer satisfaction.
We have no shortage of business drivers for the second half of fiscal 2016. Our road map includes several new additions to our system and appliance range of products, as well as significant software deliverables designed to increase our addressable market. We have the following deliverables currently target for next quarter.
We have a new high-performance FIPS appliance based on the BIG-IP 10,000 series appliances. It uses next-generation technology, enabling an 8x improvement in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core requirements in the financial services market. We are targeting the release of a new high-performance 100-gig blade for the high end VIPRION series platforms next quarter. This new VIPRION includes 100-gig interfaces and more than doubles the performance of the existing cards to enable the first ever terabyte class ADC in the market.
The new blade runs all TMOS modules and is targeted at system providers, applications including Gi firewall, Carrier-Grade NAT and intelligent traffic steering. We have already seen strong interest from the Tier 1 service providers for the 100-gig product, and we are currently testing in Tier 1 customer environments.
We will be delivering F5's next-generation iRules called iRules LX. iRules LX allows for users to leverage no. GS libraries to provide new functionality addressing the needs of the Dev Ops market, as well as custom applications that need customization and programmability. IRules LX is based in the Linerate technology and is now fully integrated into TMOS.
We also plan to introduce iApps LX, which allows for easy programming of specific use cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used web application programming language, JavaScript. IApps LX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN products as it allows these use cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ into the various SDN controllers, such as Cisco, APEC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature, which should give F5 a clear advantage with our SDN partners.
We plan to release our web application firewall in Azure this quarter -- sorry, next quarter. This will be available as part of the Azure service catalog and leverages iApps LX to significantly simplify WAF services management in the Azure public cloud. We plan to ship release 5.0 of BIG-IQ next quarter. We have already made significant improvements in the scalability ability of BIG-IQ in terms of managing hundreds of thousands of users. Release 5 now include centralized management for all security products, including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi firewall and WebSafe antifraud as new device management capabilities, ADC management and application analytics. 
Starting next quarter, we plan to extend our product portfolio by adding purpose-built security products, which will address new markets. The initial releases will include an SSL intercept and an SSL air gap solution followed by a standalone DDoS solution with new behavioral and threat intelligence capabilities in Q4.
In addition, the product -- in addition to the product deliverables I have discussed for Q3, we have the following product deliverables targeted for Q4. A comprehensive appliance refresh will start this summer, replacing all current appliances before the end of the calendar year. The new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improve price performance and will include our FPGA-based architecture, allowing for all software modules, including VCMP, to run across the entire product lineup.
Furthermore, during fiscal year 2017, we will enhance the shuttle series to offer new hybrid capabilities in the hardware that allow for seamless connectivity between the data center, private cloud and the various F5 supported public clouds. We are also working hard to release a 40-gig capable version of our software VE solution to support NFV applications for service providers to high-end enterprises. We plan to issue a demo of this at Mobile World Congress in February with a production release at the end of the fiscal year. We partnered very closely with Intel in this development and assured an early version last year at the Intel Developers Forum.
I continue to believe that F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. Our hybrid application services strategy resonates well with existing and prospective customers. Our hybrid application services strategy was reinforced by a recent survey we did of over 3.000 global customers. 10 or more application services are used by well over half of the respondents, who recognize that slow, unresponsive and unsecured application can have a substantial negative impact in their business. In addition, the vast majority of these respondents indicated the plan to indicate hybrid closed architecture in the future, which clearly endorses the F5 hybrid cloud strategy.
The strategy is in place and our focus is on execution of the strategy with an absolute priority in delivering product revenue growth. I summarized several business drivers, which will be available in the second half of fiscal 2016, and we have every intention of taking advantage of these business growth drivers.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and our customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll hand the call over for Q&A."

Let me address the second question first on these kind of the purpose-built security offerings because one of the challenges we've had with our current offering, which addresses some significant security issues out there, both with anti-fraud and web application security as well as just network level security is that as it's included in on the ADC platform, it tends to be targeted more towards the network buying centers versus the security buying centers, even though we do get good access to those. And what we wanted to do was to take our functionality, help differentiate that by essentially packaging it ways that that's consumable by these centers. And So for example, DDoS. We provide a comprehensive DDoS solution both for on premises, as well as in Silverline. And we now connect of this, but we want to make it easier now for someone then to take that on prime solution configure it and get the benefits of it without having to do the full ADC configuration. Same thing for things like S air gap and in our core proxy services that we see that these things are difficult to configure sometimes when you start looking at the full suite of what an ADC does and want to make that easier to consume and target these applications. Other ones we'd like to be able to do that with, and we want to increase the value of this by including like analytics and other things that we can differentiate, say, from our Good Better Best offering. So it just allows us more precise better targeting. It also allows us to contrast and differentiate this against existing solutions in the market versus trying to have this larger conversation around ADC level security. So it's really more just being able to build on top of what we've already done but differentiate it with the platform. In terms of the first question on competition, we hadn't really seen a big change there in terms of our traditional competitors. Citrix is still kind of sitting in there. We didn't see any real change in terms of lost wins or anything like that. In fact, in the field, we generally hear that they've -- the [indiscernible] is down. They're same with A tenants and the other small competitors. They pop up here and there. They mainly still compete on price and then lower functionality and that may target specific accounts. But in general, broadly, we haven't really seen any changes there. And there's kind of the next-generation of these kind of cloud-based ones that are coming up here and there. Really haven't seen much there. Some noise out in the market, a little bit here and there that we see. But in terms of like account wins, there's been a number of large customer accounts within them, where we've actually seen them pop up and then leave. We've been able to win those. So it hasn't been a really change for us in terms of business. Obviously, with cloud, Amazon, for example, they have kind of a very low-end load balancer that they use to provide very basic services. But Amazon is a big partner of ours, and we do quite a bit of business with -- we're providing essentially our products into their cloud. So same with Microsoft Azure. So with the cloud, there's opportunities and small threats, but quite frankly, we don't see any different environment that we've seen in the past."

In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 20",695,"Thank you, John. In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
As a result of both disciplined operational management and the benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, we achieved GAAP EPS of $1.28 per share, well above our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 per share, also well above our guidance of $1.58 to $1.61.
Product revenue of $234.7 million in the first quarter was down 2.6% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue. Service revenue of $254.8 million grew 14.9% year-over-year and represented 52% of total revenue.
Accounting for 55% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 3.8% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015. EMEA, which represented 26% of revenue, grew 9.3% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 15% of revenue and grew 7.5% year-over-year; and Japan revenue, representing 5% of total, grew 4.3% from a year ago. Sales to enterprise customers represented 62% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23% and government sales were 14%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal.
In Q1, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which represented 19.7% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.6%; Avnet representing 13.9%; and Aero, which accounted for 11%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses of $272.9 million were within our target range of $268 million to $277 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $238.3 million.
GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.3%. Reflecting the onetime benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 32.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 30.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was a record $203.9 million. In Q1, we repurchased just under 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.94 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.175 billion in cash and investments.
DSO at the end of Q1 was 51 days. Inventories were $33.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $837.5 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately 4,275 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter.
Moving on to our Q2 outlook. With an increasingly uncertain macro environment, we believe it is prudent to take a conservative approach to our outlook for the current quarter. Our revenue target for the second quarter is $480 million to $490 million.
GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be at or around 82.5%, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%.
For Q2, we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $272 million to $281 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.61 to $1.64 per share.
We plan to increase our headcount by at least 50 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be greater than $125 million, reflecting the impact of 2 federal tax payments that we normally incur during our fiscal second quarter.
We remain confident in the competitive strength of our product portfolio, our expanding footprint in security, and our strategic position for the emerging cloud opportunity. We expect that these factors, combined with improving sales execution, our upcoming new product introductions and platform refreshes will enable us to reaccelerate our top line growth in the back half of fiscal 2016 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 6% with strong profitability and operating margins, resulting in an all-time high cash flow from operations above $200 million.
From a sales perspective, EMEA, Japan and our Asia Pacific region all delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth. EMEA and Asia, both delivered record high sales bookings. Sales bookings in our Americas region were down year-over-year in Q1, as we experienced delays in closing several forecasted transactions in the U.S., especially towards the end of the quarter. However, I was pleased to see that sales transactions above $1 million remained solid in the Americas during the quarter.
Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability, along with a healthy sequential 7% increase in deferred revenue. Overall, deferred revenue grew 23% year-over-year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business.
Our Good, Better, Best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our overall product revenues. Customer adoption of the best category remains very strong. And in Q1, we continued to see year-over-year growth in sales across all regions with the highest GBB growth coming from our EMEA and APAC customers.
I was also encouraged by our software revenue in the quarter. We continued to see more than 1/3 of product revenue coming from software sales driven by security module sales. GBB and software-only VE solutions. We had several wins in the quarter, where customers are deploying our APM security module to ensure access security for their applications that have migrated into the public cloud environment. With the option to bring your own license or rent utility licenses by the hour, we offer flexible application services in the public clouds to some of our largest existing enterprise customers, as well as new smaller companies who have never used F5 before.
Security continues to be the key growth driver of our business. Million dollar plus security deals grew year-over-year in size and volume in Q1 with EMEA delivering a record quarter in security sales. Deal volume for Silverline, our cloud-based subscription DDoS and WAP security services was up double digits quarter-over-quarter and new bookings were up significantly year-over-year.
We're also starting to see business opportunities for Silverline services across all global regions with wins in EMEA and APAC this quarter. Our Silverline cloud-based subscription is clearly in the early stages of adoption and the revenue numbers are still relatively modest. However, we believe that a real growth opportunity for Silverline subscription services, and we will continue to invest in this opportunity by adding inside sales resources and offering more solutions to the Silverline portfolio.
The security team continues to innovate and add significant malware detection capabilities to protect against threats like remote access, trojans, cross-site scripting attacks and phishing attacks. In Q1, we had some good wins with our WebSafe product, including 2 notable marquee wins in the banking vertical. 
Our client list solution continues to interest enterprise security buyers. And recent attacks, such as the pervasive Dyre malware phishing scheme, has received much attention. We detect and inoculate against this type of threat without requiring customers to deploy client-based applications and without requiring them to modify their existing applications. As a result, a much lower cost and faster time to benefit.
Cisco ACE replacements continue to be an important source of product revenue in the quarter with some large million dollar plus wins. The program also continues to boost our channel with over 1/4 of the deals driven by our partners in Q1.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million this quarter. In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered solid financial results in Q1. But as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term.
As I analyze our business and growth prospects, I have absolute confidence in our strategy to meet the current and future demands of the market. We are focused on expanding our core ADC and cloud solutions to increase the size of our market in areas like SSL inspection as well as capturing hybrid and public cloud opportunities. In security, we will extend our focus on areas like the Gi firewall, application protection, and identity and access management.
We will continue to grow and expand our Silverline platform and subscription revenue. We will increase our vertical focus on the service provider market and drive repeatability with our Gi firewall, Gi LAN services, NFV solutions and take advantage of our scalability and performance leadership with products like the new 100-gig blade addition to the VIPRION chassis. 
We will continue to improve customer experience by delivering comprehensive management solutions with our BIG-IQ management and orchestration platform. We will leverage our strong partner ecosystem with leading vendors, such as Cisco, HP, Microsoft and VMware in areas like SDN as well as OpenStack environments.
Finally, we will leverage our global services organization to drive product revenue sales while delivering world-class profitability and world-class customer satisfaction.
We have no shortage of business drivers for the second half of fiscal 2016. Our road map includes several new additions to our system and appliance range of products, as well as significant software deliverables designed to increase our addressable market. We have the following deliverables currently targeted for next quarter.
We have a new high-performance FIPS appliance based on the BIG-IP 10,000 series appliances. It uses next-generation technology, enabling an 8x improvement in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core requirements in the financial services market. We are targeting the release of a new high-performance 100-gig blade for the high end VIPRION series platforms next quarter. This new VIPRION includes 100-gig interfaces and more than doubles the performance of the existing cards to enable the first ever terabyte class ADC in the market.
The new blade runs all TMOS modules and is targeted at system providers, applications including Gi firewall, Carrier-Grade NAT and intelligent traffic steering. We have already seen strong interest from the Tier 1 service providers for the 100-gig product, and we are currently testing in Tier 1 customer environments.
We will be delivering F5's next-generation iRules called iRules LX. iRules LX allows for users to leverage no. GS libraries to provide new functionality addressing the needs of the Dev Ops market, as well as customer applications that need customization and programmability. IRules LX is based in the Linerate technology and is now fully integrated into TMOS.
We also plan to introduce iApps LX, which allows for easy programming of specific use cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used web application programming language, JavaScript. IApps LX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN products as it allows these use cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ into the various SDN controllers, such as Cisco, APEC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature, which should give F5 a clear advantage with our SDN partners.
We plan to release our web application firewall in Azure this quarter -- sorry, next quarter. This will be available as part of the Azure service catalog and leverages iApps LX to significantly simplify WAF services management in the Azure public cloud. We plan to ship release 5.0 of BIG-IQ next quarter. We have already made significant improvements in the scalability of BIG-IQ in terms of managing hundreds of thousands of users. Release 5 now include centralized management for all security products, including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi firewall and WebSafe antifraud. It adds new device management capabilities, ADC management and application analytics. 
Starting next quarter, we plan to extend our product portfolio by adding purpose-built security products, which will address new markets. The initial releases will include an SSL intercept and an SSL air gap solution followed by a standalone DDoS solution with new behavioral and threat intelligence capabilities in Q4.
In addition, the product -- in addition to the product deliverables I have discussed for Q3, we have the following product deliverables targeted for Q4. A comprehensive appliance refresh will start this summer, replacing all current appliances before the end of the calendar year. The new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improve price performance and will include our FPGA-based architecture, allowing for all software modules, including VCMP, to run across the entire product lineup.
Furthermore, during fiscal year 2017, we will enhance the shuttle series to offer new hybrid capabilities in the hardware that allow for seamless connectivity between the data center, private cloud and the various F5 supported public clouds. We are also working hard to release a 40-gig capable version of our software VE solution to support NFV applications for service providers to high-end enterprises. We plan to issue a demo of this at Mobile World Congress in February with a production release at the end of the fiscal year. We partnered very closely with Intel in this development and showed an early version last year at the Intel Developers Forum.
I continue to believe that F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. Our hybrid application services strategy resonates well with existing and prospective customers. Our hybrid application services strategy was reinforced by a recent survey we did of over 3.000 global customers. 10 or more application services are used by well over half of the respondents, who recognize that slow, unresponsive and unsecured application can have a substantial negative impact in their business. In addition, the vast majority of these respondents indicated the plan to indicate hybrid cloud architecture in the future, which clearly endorses the F5 hybrid cloud strategy.
The strategy is in place and our focus is on execution of the strategy with an absolute priority in delivering product revenue growth. I summarized several business drivers, which will be available in the second half of fiscal 2016, and we have every intention of taking advantage of these business growth drivers.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and our customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll hand the call over for Q&A."

Let me address the second question first on these kind of the purpose-built security offerings because one of the challenges we've had with our current offering, which addresses some significant security issues out there, both with anti-fraud and web application security as well as just network level security is that as it's included in on the ADC platform, it tends to be targeted more towards the network buying centers versus the security buying centers, even though we do get good access to those. And what we wanted to do was to take our functionality, help differentiate that by essentially packaging it ways that's more consumable by these centers. And So for example, DDoS. We provide a comprehensive DDoS solution both for on premises, as well as in Silverline. And we now connect of this, but we want to make it easier now for someone then to take that on prem solution, configure it and get the benefits of it without having to do the full ADC configuration. Same thing for things like S air gap and in our forward proxy services that we see that these things are difficult to configure sometimes when you start looking at the full sphere of what an ADC does and want to make that easier to consume and target these applications. Other ones we'd like to be able to do that with, and we want to increase the value of this by including like analytics and other things that we can differentiate, say, from our Good Better Best offering. So it just allows us more precise better targeting. It also allows us to contrast and differentiate this against existing solutions in the market versus trying to have this larger conversation around ADC level security. So it's really more just being able to build on top of what we've already done but differentiate it with the platform. In terms of the first question on competition, we hadn't really seen a big change there in terms of our traditional competitors. Citrix is still kind of sitting in there. We didn't see any real change in terms of lost wins or anything like that. In fact, in the field, we generally hear that they've -- the competitiveness is down. They're staying with A tenants and the other small competitors. They pop up here and there. They mainly still compete on price and then lower functionality and that may target specific accounts. But in general, broadly, we haven't really seen any changes there. And there's kind of the next-generation of these kind of cloud-based ones that are coming up here and there. Really haven't seen much there. Some noise out in the market, a little bit here and there that we see. But in terms of like account wins, there's been a number of large customer accounts we've been in, where we've actually seen them pop up and then leave. We've been able to win those. So it hasn't been a really change for us in terms of business. Obviously, with cloud, Amazon, for example, they have kind of a very low-end load balancer that they use to provide very basic services. But Amazon is a big partner of ours, and we do quite a bit of business with -- we're providing essentially our products into their cloud. So same with Microsoft Azure. So with the cloud, there's opportunities and small threats, but quite frankly, we don't see any different environment than we've seen in the past."

In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 20",695,"Thank you, John. In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 
As a result of both disciplined operational management and the benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, we achieved GAAP EPS of $1.28 per share, well above our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 per share, also well above our guidance of $1.58 to $1.61.
Product revenue of $234.7 million in the first quarter was down 2.6% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue. Service revenue of $254.8 million grew 14.9% year-over-year and represented 52% of total revenue.
Accounting for 55% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 3.8% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015. EMEA, which represented 26% of revenue, grew 9.3% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 15% of revenue and grew 7.5% year-over-year; and Japan revenue, representing 5% of total, grew 4.3% from a year ago. Sales to enterprise customers represented 62% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23% and government sales were 14%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal.
In Q1, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which represented 19.7% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.6%; Avnet representing 13.9%; and Arrow, which accounted for 11%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses of $272.9 million were within our target range of $268 million to $277 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $238.3 million.
GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.3%. Reflecting the onetime benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 32.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 30.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was a record $203.9 million. In Q1, we repurchased just under 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.94 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.175 billion in cash and investments.
DSO at the end of Q1 was 51 days. Inventories were $33.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $837.5 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately 4,275 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter.
Moving on to our Q2 outlook. With an increasingly uncertain macro environment, we believe it is prudent to take a conservative approach to our outlook for the current quarter. Our revenue target for the second quarter is $480 million to $490 million.
GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be at or around 82.5%, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%.
For Q2, we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $272 million to $281 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.61 to $1.64 per share.
We plan to increase our headcount by at least 50 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be greater than $125 million, reflecting the impact of 2 federal tax payments that we normally incur during our fiscal second quarter.
We remain confident in the competitive strength of our product portfolio, our expanding footprint in security, and our strategic position for the emerging cloud opportunity. We expect that these factors, combined with improving sales execution, our upcoming new product introductions and platform refreshes will enable us to reaccelerate our top line growth in the back half of fiscal 2016 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 6% with strong profitability and operating margins, resulting in an all-time high cash flow from operations above $200 million.
From a sales perspective, EMEA, Japan and our Asia Pacific region all delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth. EMEA and Asia, both delivered record high sales bookings. Sales bookings in our Americas region were down year-over-year in Q1, as we experienced delays in closing several forecasted transactions in the U.S., especially towards the end of the quarter. However, I was pleased to see that sales transactions above $1 million remained solid in the Americas during the quarter.
Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability, along with a healthy sequential 7% increase in deferred revenue. Overall, deferred revenue grew 23% year-over-year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business.
Our Good, Better, Best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our overall product revenues. Customer adoption of the best category remains very strong. And in Q1, we continued to see year-over-year growth in sales across all regions with the highest GBB growth coming from our EMEA and APAC customers.
I was also encouraged by our software revenue in the quarter. We continued to see more than 1/3 of product revenue coming from software sales driven by security module sales; GBB and software-only VE solutions. We had several wins in the quarter, where customers are deploying our APM security module to ensure access security for their applications that have migrated into the public cloud environment. With the option to bring your own license or rent utility licenses by the hour, we offer flexible application services in the public clouds to some of our largest existing enterprise customers, as well as new smaller companies who have never used F5 before.
Security continues to be the key growth driver of our business. Million dollar plus security deals grew year-over-year in size and volume in Q1 with EMEA delivering a record quarter in security sales. Deal volume for Silverline, our cloud-based subscription DDoS and WAP security services was up by double digits quarter-over-quarter and new bookings were up significantly year-over-year.
We're also starting to see business opportunities for Silverline services across all global regions with wins in EMEA and APAC this quarter. Our Silverline cloud-based subscription is clearly in the early stages of adoption and the revenue numbers are still relatively modest. However, we believe there are real growth opportunity for Silverline subscription services, and we will continue to invest in this opportunity by adding inside sales resources and offering more solutions to the Silverline portfolio.
The security team continues to innovate and add significant malware detection capabilities to protect against threats like remote access, trojans, cross-site scripting attacks and phishing attacks. In Q1, we had some good wins with our WebSafe product, including 2 notable marquee wins in the banking vertical. 
Our client list solution continues to interest enterprise security buyers. And recent attacks, such as the pervasive Dyre malware phishing scheme, has received much attention. We detect and inoculate against this type of threat without requiring customers to deploy client-based applications and without requiring them to modify their existing applications. As a result, a much lower cost and faster time to benefit.
Cisco ACE replacements continue to be an important source of product revenue in the quarter with some large million dollar plus wins. The program also continues to boost our channel with over 1/4 of the deals driven by our partners in Q1.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million this quarter. In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered solid financial results in Q1. But as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term.
As I analyze our business and growth prospects, I have absolute confidence in our strategy to meet the current and future demands of the market. We are focused on expanding our core ADC and cloud solutions to increase the size of our market in areas like SSL inspection as well as capturing hybrid and public cloud opportunities. In security, we will extend our focus on areas like the Gi firewall, application protection, and identity and access management.
We will continue to grow and expand our Silverline platform and subscription revenue. We will increase our vertical focus on the service provider market and drive repeatability with our Gi firewall, Gi LAN services, NFV solutions and take advantage of our scalability and performance leadership with products like the new 100-gig blade addition to the VIPRION chassis. 
We will continue to improve customer experience by delivering comprehensive management solutions with our BIG-IQ management and orchestration platform. We will leverage our strong partner ecosystem with leading vendors, such as Cisco, HP, Microsoft and VMware and areas like SDN as well as OpenStack environments.
Finally, we will leverage our global services organization to drive product revenue sales while delivering world-class profitability and world-class customer satisfaction.
We have no shortage of business drivers for the second half of fiscal 2016. Our road map includes several new additions to our system and appliance range of products, as well as significant software deliverables designed to increase our addressable market. We have the following deliverables currently targeted for next quarter.
We have a new high-performance FIPS appliance based on the BIG-IP 10,000 series appliances. It uses next-generation technology, enabling an 8x improvement in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core requirements in the financial services market. We are targeting the release of a new high-performance 100-gig blade for the high end VIPRION series platforms next quarter. This new VIPRION includes 100-gig interfaces and more than doubles the performance of the existing cards to enable the first ever terabyte class ADC in the market.
The new blade runs all TMOS modules and is targeted at system providers, applications including Gi firewall, Carrier-Grade NAT and intelligent traffic steering. We have already seen strong interest from the Tier 1 service providers for the 100-gig product, and we are currently testing in Tier 1 customer environments.
We will be delivering F5's next-generation iRules called iRules LX. iRules LX allows for users to leverage no. GS libraries to provide new functionality addressing the needs of the Dev Ops market, as well as customer applications that need customization and programmability. IRules LX is based in the Linerate technology and is now fully integrated into TMOS.
We also plan to introduce iApps LX, which allows for easy programming of specific use cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used web application programming language, JavaScript. IApps LX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN products as it allows these use cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ into the various SDN controllers, such as Cisco, APEC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature, which should give F5 a clear advantage with our SDN partners.
We plan to release our web application firewall in Azure this quarter -- sorry, next quarter. This will be available as part of the Azure service catalog and leverages iApps LX to significantly simplify WAF services management in the Azure public cloud. We plan to ship release 5.0 of BIG-IQ next quarter. We have already made significant improvements in the scalability of BIG-IQ in terms of managing hundreds of thousands of users. Release 5 now include centralized management for all security products, including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi firewall and WebSafe antifraud. It adds new device management capabilities, ADC management and application analytics. 
Starting next quarter, we plan to extend our product portfolio by adding purpose-built security products, which will address new markets. The initial releases will include an SSL intercept and an SSL air gap solution followed by a standalone DDoS solution with new behavioral and threat intelligence capabilities in Q4.
In addition, the product -- in addition to the product deliverables I have discussed for Q3, we have the following product deliverables targeted for Q4. A comprehensive appliance refresh will start this summer, replacing all current appliances before the end of the calendar year. The new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improve price performance and will include our FPGA-based architecture, allowing for all software modules, including VCMP, to run across the entire product lineup.
Furthermore, during fiscal year 2017, we will enhance the shuttle series to offer new hybrid capabilities in the hardware that allow for seamless connectivity between the data center, private cloud and the various F5 supported public clouds. We are also working hard to release a 40-gig capable version of our software VE solution to support NFV applications for service providers to high-end enterprises. We plan to issue a demo of this at Mobile World Congress in February with a production release at the end of the fiscal year. We partnered very closely with Intel in this development and showed an early version last year at the Intel Developers Forum.
I continue to believe that F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. Our hybrid application services strategy resonates well with existing and prospective customers. Our hybrid application services strategy was reinforced by a recent survey we did of over 3.000 global customers. 10 or more application services are used by well over half of the respondents, who recognize that slow, unresponsive and unsecured application can have a substantial negative impact in their business. In addition, the vast majority of these respondents indicated they plan to implement hybrid cloud architecture in the future, which clearly endorses the F5 hybrid cloud strategy.
The strategy is in place and our focus is on execution of the strategy with an absolute priority in delivering product revenue growth. I summarized several business drivers, which will be available in the second half of fiscal 2016, and we have every intention of taking advantage of these business growth drivers.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and our customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll hand the call over for Q&A."

Let me address the second question first on these kind of the purpose-built security offerings because one of the challenges we've had with our current offering, which addresses some significant security issues out there, both with anti-fraud and web application security as well as just network level security is that as it's included in on the ADC platform, it tends to be targeted more towards the network buying centers versus the security buying centers, even though we do get good access to those. And what we wanted to do was to take our functionality, help differentiate that by essentially packaging it ways that's more consumable by these centers. And So for example, DDoS. We provide a comprehensive DDoS solution both for on premises, as well as in Silverline. And we now connect of this, but we want to make it easier now for someone then to take that on prem solution, configure it and get the benefits of it without having to do the full ADC configuration. Same thing for things like SSL air gap and in our forward proxy services that we see that these things are difficult to configure sometimes when you start looking at the full sphere of what an ADC does and want to make that easier to consume and target these applications. Other ones we'd like to be able to do that with, and we want to increase the value of this by including like analytics and other things that we can differentiate, say, from our Good Better Best offering. So it just allows us more precise better targeting. It also allows us to contrast and differentiate this against existing solutions in the market versus trying to have this larger conversation around ADC level security. So it's really more just being able to build on top of what we've already done but differentiate it with the platform. In terms of the first question on competition, we hadn't really seen a big change there in terms of our traditional competitors. Citrix is still kind of sitting in there. We didn't see any real change in terms of loss, wins or anything like that. In fact, in the field, we generally hear that they've -- the competitiveness is down. They're staying with A10 and the other small competitors. They pop up here and there. They mainly still compete on price and then lower functionality and then may target specific accounts. But in general, broadly, we haven't really seen any changes there. And there's kind of the next-generation of these kind of cloud-based ones that are coming up here and there. Really haven't seen much there. Some noise out in the market, a little bit here and there that we see. But in terms of like account wins, there's been a number of large customer accounts we've been in, where we've actually seen them pop up and then leave. We've been able to win those. So it hasn't been a really change for us in terms of business. Obviously, with cloud, Amazon, for example, they have kind of a very low-end load balancer that they use to provide very basic services. But Amazon is a big partner of ours, and we do quite a bit of business with -- we're providing essentially our products into their cloud. So same with Microsoft Azure. So with the cloud, there's opportunities and small threats, but quite frankly, we don't see any different environment than we've seen in the past."

In a relatively challenging environment, F5 delivered year-over-year revenue growth and strong profitability.

In a relatively challenging environment, F5 delivered year-over-year revenue growth and strong profitability. Revenue in Q2 grew 2.4% year-over-year to $483.7 million within our guided range of $480 million to $490 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.68, above our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.64 per share. These results exceeded our forecast driven by strength in gross margins and prudent management of expenses, as well as a decrease to our worldwide effective tax rate and a strong buyback of our common stock.
GAAP EPS of $1.11 per share was below our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16 per share due to one-time costs for a patent-related jury verdict and other costs associated without litigation. The related impact of these one-time costs to GAAP EPS was approximately $0.08. Product revenue of $225.4 million declined 4% sequentially and 8% year-over-year and represented a 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $258.2 million increased 1% sequentially, 13% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue.
Revenue from the Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter; EMEA contributed 25%; APAC, 13% and Japan, 5%. On a year-over-year basis, the Americas were up 1%. EMEA revenue was up 8%. APAC revenue grew 1% and Japan revenue was down 1%. 
Enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21% and government sales were 16%, including 7% of total sales from U.S. federal. 
In Q2, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors, Westcon, which accounted for 18.2% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which represented 15% of total revenue; and Avnet, representing 13.3%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. 
Including $8.9 million for patent-related jury verdict and other costs associated with that litigation, GAAP operating expenses were $286.5 million, above our guided range of $272 million to $281 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude these patent litigation costs, as well as stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, were $239.8 million. GAAP operating margin was 23.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 34.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.7%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $133.1 million. In Q2, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $94.62 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments. At its April meeting, the Board approved an additional share repurchase authorization of up to $1 billion. 
DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories were $35.2 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $16.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $842.7 million. And we ended the quarter with approximately 4,325 employees, an increase of 50 from the prior quarter.
Onto our fiscal Q3 outlook. As we enter into the historically stronger second half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on business execution and the delivery of our upcoming new products and features to drive the next leg of growth for F5. With this in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 is $490 million to $500 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82.5% range, including approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $270 million to $279 million. This includes approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33%.
Our GAAP EPS target is $1.29 to $1.32 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.77 to $1.80 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by up to 50 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $155 million. With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,328566335,960165,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, I was pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q2 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 2.4% with strong profitability and operating margins in a relatively challenging business environmen",1668,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, I was pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q2 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 2.4% with strong profitability and operating margins in a relatively challenging business environment. 
From a sales perspective, EMEA, Japan and our Asia Pacific region all delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth. Sales bookings in our America region were down year-over-year in Q2, as we experienced a drop in sales in our 2 strongest finance and telco. 
However, in spite of the shortfall in these verticals, sales from land transactions remained solid in the Americas during the quarter with year-over-year growth from sales in the $1 million plus category. Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 13%. Also, deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business. 
Our good/better/best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our bookings with year-over-year growth of 25%. As in previous quarters, customer adoption of the best category remains very strong. 
Overall, software revenue also remained strong in Q2 with more than 1/3 of product revenue coming from software sales, driven by security module sales, GBB and software-only VE solutions. Security continues to be the growth driver of our business. We had a number of excellent wins last quarter driven by an application in security modules with strong year-over-year growth in large transactions. 
For example, a global Fortune 25 company invested almost $1 million in the F5 APM solution to enable identity and access management for our employees and to the Microsoft Office 365 environment. Also, we won a project with a U.S. regional airline who invested nearly $1 million in our on-premise Web application firewall to help mitigate malicious and organic DDoS-oriented service interruptions. 
Another example was with a telco provider with more than 20 million subscribers, which made a significant investment in Silverline anti-DDoS services to thwart attacks orchestrated by an unidentified activist. 
We delivered solid sequential and year-over-year growth from Silverline, our cloud-based subscription DDOS and WAP security services. The pipeline for silverline services continues to grow and they continue to invest in additional headcount in sales and support resources to take advantage of this growth opportunity. 
We also launched an on-site sales initiatives in Q2 targeting the midrange market opportunity for this real need for application and DDoS protection ideally suited to a subscription service model. We also had some excellent wins in the hybrid private and public cloud environment. A large European banking customer purchased over several hundred thousand dollars of DE subscription licenses through the AWS Marketplace for the deployment of a new customer engagement portal that coexist with the existing infrastructure and will ultimately support more than 10 million customers. 
A large SaaS customer invested in VE license through the AWS Marketplace to provision Layer 7 local traffic management capabilities on a new platform as a service offering to an installed base. Another cloud win last quarter involves a large U.S.-based entertainment content provider purchasing VE licenses through the AWS Marketplace as part of the lifted shift strategy to move their customer interaction operations into the public cloud. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $490 million to $500 million. In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered solid financial results in Q2. But as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. 
We have made good progress in all our strategic and major initiatives in Q2. As I mentioned last quarter, we have no shortage of short-term business drivers, which we will introduce starting this current quarter. Earlier this month, we introduced a new version of TMOS version 12.1, known internally as a cascade release. Cascade supports the new 100 gig blade for a high-end VIPRION, which I will talk about shortly. Cascade also make huge strides to increase F5's leadership in application programmability and application deployment. 
Cascade introduces F5's next-generation iRules and IR functionality called iRules LX and iApps LX. IRules LX allows users to leverage no labor libraries that provide new functionality addressing the needs of the Dev Ops market, as well as customer applications that need customization and programmability. 
IRules LX is based on the technology and is fully integrated into TMOS. IApps LX allows for easy programming of specific use cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used Web application programming language, JavaScript. IApps LX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN products, as it allows use cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ into the various SDN controllers, such as the Cisco, APEC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature, which should give F5 a great advantage with the SDN partners. We are on track to deliver a new performance fit supplies and LME based on the BIG-IP 10 KC appliances. It uses next generation technology enabling an 8x improving in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core climates in both our financial services and the Federal markets. 
We successfully demonstrated our 100 gig blade for the high end VIPRION series platform at Mobile World Congress last quarter. The new VIPRION 100 gig interfaces more than doubles the performance of our existing cards, thereby, enabling the first ever terabit class ADC in the market. We are seeing strong interest in the 100 gig blade from our global service providers and have already received an initial $1 million plus order for the product. The 100 gig blade is on track for delivery in May, and we would expect to see initial revenues for the 100 gig blade this quarter can come in Q3 with growing momentum in Q4 and into fiscal 2017.
The new blade runs all TMOS application modules and is targeted at service provider applications, including our G.I. firewall, [indiscernible] and intelligent traffic steering. BIG-IQ release 5 is also on track for release this quarter, and we are very encouraged by the customer reaction to the new functionality and scalability improvement that are included in the release. 
Release 5 includes centralized management for all security products, including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi firewall and WebSafe antifraud. It also adds new device management capabilities, ADC Management and Application Analytics. I mentioned in last quarter's call that we plan to expand our product portfolio by adding purpose built security products, which will address new markets. The initial release will include an SSL into effect, an SSL air gap solution, as well as stand-alone -- as well as a stand-alone DDoS solution with new behavioral and threat intelligence capabilities. There have been some small changes in the delivery scheduled for these 2 products. The initial release of the SSL intercept and air gap products will now be available in early July and the stand-alone DDoS products should be available slightly earlier-than-expected with availability towards the end of this current quarter. 
It's worth noting that we have already one large SSL intercept project using our existing iRules on our current ADC lineage products. The initial version of the stand-alone SSL intercept solutions will use our existing iApp technology to allow much a simpler implementation. This will then be enhanced further by using the new iApps LX optionality in a later release. 
We're also making good progress to release a 40 gig capable version of our software VE solution. Intel demonstrated our F5 VE solution in 100 gig environment at Mobile World Congress and received a lot of interest from service providers who have the goal of driving and if the architectures in the future. 
Progress on our plan to deliver a comprehensive appliance refresh is going well. And we are on track to commence delivery of the new products in July and have all products available within a 3 to 4-month window. The new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improved performance, decrease total cost of ownership and increase our competitive leadership. However, the shuttle series is much more than a single product line upgrade. The shuttle series develops friendly and encompasses a field stack of security solutions and offer specific persona-based customized solutions using a proprietary FPGA software-defined hardware functionality. The shuttle series will support our application modules across entire product lineup and are designed to support and enable 2 team architectures, including hybrid clouds. 
Our higher level goal with the shuttle series is to bridge the gap between traditional IT, the dev ops environments and the emerging cloud architecture. I continue to believe F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of trends and customer requirements. Our absolute focus is on execution with a primary goal of delivering product revenue growth. And I believe this growth will be achieved as we deliver to the new product business drivers to the market. 
We have added several key executives to the F5 team last quarter to support and enhance our focus on execution. You may have seen the recent press releases announcing the appointment of key sales and security executives to F5. I'm really excited to have Pete Brand, David Helfer and Mike in the F5 team. Pete joins us as SPP for North American sales and brings with him a fantastic track record with more than 20 years of experience in technology and security sales. David joins us as VP of Worldwide Channels and brings extensive experience global channels and sales operation, again, with a fantastic track record. Mike is F5's first Chief Information Security Officer. His first priority is to continue protection of the company's customer assets and data. Mike will also play a lead role in the development of F5 security products -- securities product roadmap and represent F5 in the IT industry and wider security community.

As we talk about quite a bit, if we do get gross margin improvement, we'd like to look at how we can invest that back in our business. And our most recent obvious examples is bringing Silverline to market with really out much of an impact on our overall business model.

In terms of the first question on the outside north -- outside of the Americas in terms of how the growth profile. I'm not sure it's directed at market share gain and or customer penetration. I think, first of all, typically, when we penetrate, say, the times 200, that's a good thing because that means we do more and more business. So we love the concept of penetrating into existing customers. There's so many applications of that we can sit in front of and optimize. I don't think it's really that.

Can you update us on where you are, how much more you need to do to get to where you where you want any to be and then a quick question for Andy. Andy, historically in Virtual Editions, I think you've referenced the fact that ASPs used to see there were 80% of the price point on hardware. I think more recently, you reference them as being comparable. But I think you've always have been net income impact was awash. I know was hoping you can update us. And one final question if I me, remember here. But John, on the living area issue and your comments about enterprise demand, we had recently note that you saw meaningful downtick in the month of March from a number of chemical and you've named the obviously.

What we did see about that and I commented on was that we felt better about the visibility in March. In other words, by visibility, what I'm talking about is we look at -- when looking at the pipeline in merely the forecasted deals for that quarter, and the visibility of that improved quite radically over the previous 2 quarters. We felt -- that's a combination probably of macro, but also of good sales management to make sure that we know what's going on. But the that -- and that's important to us. So not -- I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't put too much on the leading charity thing because it was it might be different from what we expect. It was a little bit soft in January and February, and we were a bit worried about visibility. In other words, we thought we do without all the better than we do. But we came to merge, and we felt that the split was excellent. So that's on -- oh, yes, the AWS and the cloud and that question. I mean, I realized that a lot of concern we just got this stuff a lot internally. But when we look at the installed base and the customers heavy opportunities, we see a lot with things like our WAP product, our APM product that actually get 3 examples in fact, of that type of thing. So there are definitely opportunities there as well. But we've seen new business opportunities where a fairly big companies where we had no presence and we managed to get into that company via AWS marketplace interestingly enough. And obviously, we feel good about this whole hybrid side of things, especially maybe more and more focused orchestration in areas like that. Having said all that, I do still think that it's actually causing delay in spending overall. We also see some partnership ops -- opportunities with companies like Microsoft and Amazon, or AWS, in terms of working with them on enterprise customers. And we had one very good example of that, that I mentioned the banking company, where that was an example of a partnership. Yes, I think it's early days. I mean, it's not that we -- we don't look at the pipeline right now and say, oh, my God, this is shrinking because of Amazon we don't see that or because of the public cloud. And there's no doubt in my mind, we probably don't get some business that we've got before of a start-up company that will go straight to the public cloud and maybe just instead of buying equipment just ran some software that software could well be ours. But it's not critical. yes, the major concern it gives us right now is it is it going daily and from an opportunity perspective, how can we maximize our product on those public clouds and by partnering with a very the cloud vendors."

And essentially, at our entry-level, hardware systems, you do see parity on the gross margin dollar still. So it's not quite the same price wise, but it's equivalent on the gross margin dollars. And we're still seeing that deal sizes aren't necessarily smaller because usually, when they're buying Virtual Editions, they're deploying them on a more horizontal type of architecture. So they need more versions of it. So we're still in that kind of position. In some of the things that I'd highlight the was we're looking a new licensing model specifically for the cloud. So bring your own license or you can take VE and move it as you want to. An enterprise license agreements. If they want a license in large scale, we'll do an enterprise license agreement. And I think where we're coming at with a 40 gig VE and an FF environment, you might see that as well, where we do a lot of larger to enterprise type licensing agreements, and then we'll see how that works out at discounting. And then we do offer on a utility basis, on AWS, the ability to pull out your credit card and license our Virtual Editions.

GAAP EPS of $1.11 per share was below our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16 per share due to onetime costs for a patent-related jury verdict and other costs associated with that litigation. The related impact of these onetime costs to GAAP EPS was approximately $0.08. Product revenue of $225.4 million declined 4% sequentially and 8% year-over-year and represented 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $258.2 million increased 1% sequentially, 13% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue.
Revenue from the Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter; EMEA contributed 25%; APAC 13%; and Japan 5%. On a year-over-year basis, the Americas were up 1%; EMEA revenue was up 8%; APAC revenue grew 1%; and Japan revenue was down 1%. 
Enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21% and government sales were 16%, including 7% of total sales from U.S. federal. 
In Q2, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18.2% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which represented 15% of total revenue; and Avnet representing 13.3%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. 
Including $8.9 million for patent-related jury verdict and other costs associated with that litigation, GAAP operating expenses were $286.5 million, above our guided range of $272 million to $281 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude these patent litigation costs as well as stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, were $239.8 million. GAAP operating margin was 23.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 34.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.7%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $133.1 million. In Q2, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $94.62 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments. At its April meeting, the Board approved an additional share repurchase authorization of up to $1 billion. 
DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories were $35.2 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $16.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $842.7 million. And we ended the quarter with approximately 4,325 employees, an increase of 50 from the prior quarter.
Onto our fiscal Q3 outlook. As we enter into the historically stronger second half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on business execution and the delivery of our upcoming new products and features to drive the next leg of growth for F5. With this in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 is $490 million to $500 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82.5% range, including approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $270 million to $279 million. This includes approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33%.
Our GAAP EPS target is $1.29 to $1.32 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.77 to $1.80 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by up to 50 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $155 million. With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Overall, I was pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q2 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 2.4%, with strong profitability and operating margins in a relatively challenging business environment. 
From a sales perspective, EMEA, Japan and our Asia Pacific region all delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth. Sales bookings in our America region were down year-over-year in Q2 as we experienced a drop in sales in our 2 strongest verticals, finance and telco. 
However, in spite of the shortfall in these verticals, sales from large transactions remained solid in the Americas during the quarter, with year-over-year growth from sales in the $1 million plus category. Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability, with year-over-year revenue growth of 13%. Also, deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business. 
Our good/better/best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our bookings, with year-over-year growth of 25%. As in previous quarters, customer adoption of the best category remains very strong. 
Overall, software revenue also remained strong in Q2, with more than 1/3 of the product revenue coming from software sales, driven by security module sales; GBB and software-only VE solutions. Security continues to be the growth driver of our business. We had a number of excellent wins last quarter, driven by our application security modules, with strong year-over-year growth in large transactions. 
For example, a global Fortune 25 company invested almost $1 million in the F5 APM solution to enable identity and access management for their employees into the Microsoft Office 365 environment. Also, we won a project with a U.S. regional airline, who invested nearly $1 million in our on-premise Web application firewall to help mitigate malicious and organic DDoS-oriented service interruptions. 
Another example was with a telco provider with more than 20 million subscribers, which made a significant investment in Silverline anti-DDoS services to thwart attacks orchestrated by an unidentified activist. 
We delivered solid sequential and year-over-year growth from Silverline, our cloud-based subscription DDOS and WAP security services. The pipeline for Silverline services continues to grow, and we continue to invest in additional headcount in sales and support resources to take advantage of this growth opportunity. 
We also launched an inside initiative in Q2 targeting the midrange market opportunity where there is real need for application and DDoS protection ideally suited to a subscription service model. We also had some excellent wins in the hybrid private and public cloud environments. A large European banking customer purchased over several hundred thousand dollars of VE subscription licenses through the AWS Marketplace for the deployment of a new customer engagement portal that coexist with the existing infrastructure and will ultimately support more than 10 million customers. 
A large SaaS customer invested in VE license through the AWS Marketplace to provision Layer 7 local traffic management capabilities on a new platform as a service offering to an installed base. Another cloud win last quarter involves a large U.S.-based entertainment content provider purchasing VE licenses through the AWS Marketplace as part of the lift and shift strategy to move their customer interaction operations into the public cloud. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $490 million to $500 million. In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered solid financial results in Q2. But as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. 
We have made good progress in all our strategic and major initiatives in Q2. As I mentioned last quarter, we have no shortage of short-term business drivers, which we will introduce starting this current quarter. Earlier this month, we introduced a new version of TMOS, version 12.1, known internally as a cascade release. Cascade supports a new 100-gig blade for high-end VIPRION series, which I will talk about shortly. Cascade also make huge strides to increase F5's leadership in application programmability and application deployment. 
Cascade introduces F5's next-generation iRules and iApp functionality called iRules LX and iApps LX. IRules LX allows users to leverage no. GS libraries to provide new functionality addressing the needs of the Dev Ops market as well as customer applications that need customization and programmability. 
IRules LX is based on the Linerate technology and is fully integrated into TMOS. IApps LX allows for easy programming of specific use cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used Web application programming language, JavaScript. IApps LX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN products, as it allows use cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ into the various SDN controllers, such as the Cisco, APEC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature, which should give F5 a clear advantage with our SDN partners. We are on track to deliver a new performance FIPS appliance and LME based on the BIG-IP 10K series appliances. It uses next generation technology, enabling an 8x improvement in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core requirements in both our financial services and the federal markets. 
We successfully demonstrated our 100-gig blade for the high-end VIPRION series platform at Mobile World Congress last quarter. The new VIPRION 100-gig interfaces more than doubles the performance of the existing cards, thereby enabling the first-ever terabit-class ADC in the market. We are seeing strong interest in the 100-gig blade from our global service providers and have already received an initial $1 million plus order for the product. The 100-gig blade is on track for delivery in May, and we would expect to see initial revenues from the 100-gig blade this quarter can come in Q3, with growing momentum in Q4 and into fiscal 2017.
The new blade runs all TMOS application modules and is targeted at service provider applications, including our Gi firewall, Carrier-Grade NAT and intelligent traffic steering. BIG-IQ release 5 is also on track for release this quarter, and we are very encouraged by the customer reaction to the new functionality and scalability improvement that are included in the release. 
Release 5 includes centralized management for all security products, including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi firewall and WebSafe antifraud. It also adds new device management capabilities, ADC management and application analytics. I mentioned in last quarter's call that we plan to expand our product portfolio by adding purpose-built security products, which will address new markets. The initial release will include an SSL intercept and SSL air gap solution as well as stand-alone -- as well as a stand-alone DDoS solution, with new behavioral and threat intelligence capabilities. There have been some small changes in the delivery schedule for these 2 products. The initial release of the SSL intercept and air gap products will now be available in early July and the stand-alone DDoS products should be available slightly earlier-than-expected with availability towards the end of this current quarter. 
It's worth noting that we have already 1 large SSL intercept project using our existing iRules on our current ADC range of products. The initial version of the stand-alone SSL intercept solution will use our existing iApp technology to allow a much simpler implementation. This will then be enhanced further by using the new iApp LX functionality in the later release. 
We're also making good progress to release a 40-gig capable version of our software VE solution. Intel demonstrated our F5 VE solution in 100-gig environment at Mobile World Congress and received a lot of interest from service providers, who have the goal of driving NFV architectures in the future. 
Progress on our plan to deliver a comprehensive appliance refresh is going well. And we are on track to commence delivery of the new products in July and have all products available within a 3 to 4-month window. The new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improve performance, decrease total cost of ownership and increase our competitive leadership. However, the shuttle series is much more than a simple product line upgrade. The shuttle series is Dev Ops friendly and encompasses a full stack of security solutions and offer specific persona-based customized solutions using our proprietary FPGA software-defined hardware functionality. The shuttle series will support our application modules across entire product lineup and are designed to support and enable [indiscernible] architectures, including hybrid clouds. 
Our higher level goal with the shuttle series is to bridge the gap between traditional IT, the Dev Ops environments and the emerging cloud architecture. I continue to believe F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. Our absolute focus is on execution with a primary goal of delivering product revenue growth. And I believe this goal will be achieved as we deliver the new product business drivers to the market. 
We have added several key executives to the F5 team last quarter to support and enhance our focus on execution. You may have seen recent press releases announcing the appointment of key sales and security executives to F5. I am really excited to have Pete Brant, David Helfer and Mike Convertino in the F5 team. Pete joins us as SVP for North American sales and brings with him a fantastic track record with more than 20 years of experience in technology and security sales. David joins us as VP of Worldwide Channels and brings extensive experience in global channels and sales operation, again with a fantastic track record. Mike is F5's first Chief Information Security Officer. His first priority is continued protection of the company's customer assets and data. Mike will also play a lead role in the development of F5 security products -- securities product roadmap and represent F5 in the IT industry and wider security community. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll hand the call over to Q&A."

But we are also -- in our opinion, we think there are delays in spending caused by customers effectively strategizing over newer cloud architectures and applications it should take and basically planning that. So I think we're seeing some slowness because of the transformation in architecture. So that's 2 reasons. I must admit that I think there's another reason. I mean, over time, we've seen some disruption. And it's been well-publicized in management. I think that's behind us now. I talked about some of the hiring that John DiLullo in particular has done over the last couple of quarters with -- some of the back in charge in North America and feel really good about that. But it's -- the 2 big ones for us are really that you had macro combined with the factor that the cloud architectures and you combine those 2 together and make easy to make a delay in the spending decision. And then in terms of the Osborne-type question that you asked about. Not really. I can't say we're seeing much of that. We're watching that like a hawk, especially this quarter, because I did see the big product shipments, which is the shuttle series, is now destined for July.

Our goal has always been to add features to increase the addressable market, especially in security. And that's where you're going to see. Speeds and feeds are great because they tend to be pretty tactical from a growth perspective and we'll take advantage of that. So over time, what we are interested in is building our security portfolio that's absolutely focused on our skill set, which is application security and then increasing that. And increasing it not just by functionality, but also, by the way, we take it to market; like for example, Silverline services, cloud based and then of course, putting that software on all the public clouds as well."

Having said all that, I -- we look at the interest level in the 100-gig blade, and it's very high. We're not announcing. We're not shipping it until May. We have taken fairly sizable order already, and we expect to meet revenue this quarter.

I would probably say that because it's going to be available this quarter, one cancels out the other. Another was, I don't think there's going to be any significant related cause of the 100 gig, just to be specific. Regarding the turnover question. We don't really talk about that stuff much, but I will comment on it. We did see some turnover last quarter in the Americas. We're addressing that aggressively.

Obviously, there's been a lot of concern among the investment community about your position relative to the cloud, Amazon in particular, but the cloud in general. You referenced that, I believe, you referenced 2 wins in your prepared remarks. Any additional color around that -- I recognized you've been rejiggering your portfolio to optimize your cloud offerings to streamline and to get the right price points. Can you update us on where you are, how much more you need to do to get to where you want and need to be? And then a quick question for Andy. Andy, historically on Virtual Editions, I think you've referenced the fact that ASPs, you used to say they were 80% of the price point on hardware. I think more recently you referenced them as being comparable. But I think you've always said the net income impact was awash. I'm hoping you could update us. And one final question if I may, another number here. John, on the linearity issue, in your comments about enterprise demand, we had actually recently note that there was -- you saw meaningful downtick in the month of March from a number of com equipment suppliers and you've named them obviously. But and then in your comments, if I understood you correctly, the quarter started off slow coming at the last quarter in January and February and there was a pickup in March, I'm just wondering if you could shed any more light in terms of the pattern as it speaks to forward business."

What we did see about that and I commented on was that we felt better about the visibility in March. In other words, by visibility, what I'm talking about is we look at -- we're looking at the pipeline in mainly the forecasted deals for that quarter and the visibility of that improved quite radically over the previous 2 quarters. We felt -- that's a combination probably of macro, but also of good sales management to make sure that we know what's going on. But that -- and that's important to us. So I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't put too much on the linearity thing because that was -- it wasn't widely different from what we would expect. It was a little bit soft in January and February, and we were a bit worried about the visibility. In other words, we felt we do a little bit better than we did. We felt we do a little better than we did. But we came to March and we felt that visibility was excellent. So that's -- oh, yes, on the AWS and the cloud and that question, I mean, I realized that a lot can say and we discuss the stuff a lot internally. But when we look at the installed base and the customers and the opportunities, we see a lot with things like our WAP product, our APM product that I actually get 3 examples in fact, of that type of thing. So there are definitely opportunities there as well. But we've seen new business opportunities, where a fairly big companies where we had no presence and we managed to get into that company via AWS Marketplace interestingly enough. And obviously, we feel good about the whole hybrid side of things, especially going to be more and more focused on orchestration and areas like that. Having said all that, I do still think that it's been causing causing delay in spending overall. We also see some partnership ops -- opportunities with companies like Microsoft and Amazon, or AWS, in terms of working with them on enterprise customers. And we had one very good example of that. I mentioned the banking company, where that was an example of a partnership. Yes, I think it's early days. I mean, it's not that we -- we don't look at the pipeline right now and say, ""Oh! my God, this is shrinking because of Amazon."" We don't see that or because of the public cloud. There's no doubt in my mind, we probably don't get some business we've got before of a start-up company that go straight to the public cloud and maybe just instead of buying equipment just run some software, that software could well be ours. But it's not critical. Yes, the major concern it gives us right now is, is it causing delays and then from an opportunity perspective, how can we maximize our product on those public clouds and by partnering with the cloud vendors."

And essentially, at our entry-level hardware systems, you do see parity on the gross margin dollar still. So it's not quite the same price wise, but it's equivalent on the gross margin dollars. And we're still seeing the deal sizes aren't necessarily smaller because usually, when they're buying virtual editions, they're deploying them on a more horizontal type of architecture. So they need more versions of it. So we're still in that kind of position. Some of the things I'd highlight though was we're looking at new licensing models specifically for the cloud. So bring your own license or you can take the VE and move it as you want to. Enterprise license agreements. If they want a license in large scale, we'll do an enterprise license agreement. And I think where we're coming out with a 40-gig VE. In an NFV environment, you may see that as well, where we do a lot of larger to enterprise-type license agreements, and then we'll see how that works out at discounting. And then we do offer on a utility basis, on AWS, the ability to pull out your credit card and license our virtual edition. So we'll continue to be looking at those business models to evolve them to the needs of our customers."

In a relatively challenging environment, F5 delivered year-over-year revenue growth and strong profitability.

In a relatively challenging environment, F5 delivered year-over-year revenue growth and strong profitability. Revenue in Q2 grew 2.4% year-over-year to $483.7 million within our guided range of $480 million to $490 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.68, above our guided range of $1.61 to $1.64 per share. These results exceeded our forecast, driven by strength in gross margins and prudent management of expenses as well as a decrease to our worldwide effective tax rate and the strong buyback of our common stock.
GAAP EPS of $1.11 per share was below our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16 per share due to onetime costs for a patent-related jury verdict and other costs associated with that litigation. The related impact of these onetime costs to GAAP EPS was approximately $0.08. Product revenue of $225.4 million declined 4% sequentially and 8% year-over-year and represented 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $258.2 million increased 1% sequentially, 13% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue.
Revenue from the Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter; EMEA contributed 25%; APAC 13%; and Japan 5%. On a year-over-year basis, the Americas were up 1%; EMEA revenue was up 8%; APAC revenue grew 1%; and Japan revenue was down 1%. 
Enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21% and government sales were 16%, including 7% of total sales from U.S. federal. 
In Q2, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18.2% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which represented 15% of total revenue; and Avnet representing 13.3%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. 
Including $8.9 million for patent-related jury verdict and other costs associated with that litigation, GAAP operating expenses were $286.5 million, above our guided range of $272 million to $281 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude these patent litigation costs as well as stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, were $239.8 million. GAAP operating margin was 23.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 34.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.7%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $133.1 million. In Q2, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $94.62 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments. At its April meeting, the board approved an additional share repurchase authorization of up to $1 billion. 
DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories were $35.2 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $16.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $842.7 million. And we ended the quarter with approximately 4,325 employees, an increase of 50 from the prior quarter.
Onto our fiscal Q3 outlook. As we enter into the historically stronger second half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on business execution and the delivery of our upcoming new products and features to drive the next leg of growth for F5. With this in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 is $490 million to $500 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82.5% range, including approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $270 million to $279 million. This includes approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33%.
Our GAAP EPS target is $1.29 to $1.32 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.77 to $1.80 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by up to 50 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $155 million. With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Overall, I was pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q2 performance.

Overall, I was pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q2 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 2.4%, with strong profitability and operating margins in a relatively challenging business environment. 
From a sales perspective, EMEA, Japan and our Asia Pacific region all delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth. Sales bookings in our America region were down year-over-year in Q2 as we experienced a drop in sales in our 2 strongest verticals, finance and telco. 
However, in spite of the shortfall in these verticals, sales from large transactions remained solid in the Americas during the quarter, with year-over-year growth from sales in the $1 million plus category. Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability, with year-over-year revenue growth of 13%. Also, deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business. 
Our good/better/best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our bookings, with year-over-year growth of 25%. As in previous quarters, customer adoption of the best category remains very strong. 
Overall, software revenue also remained strong in Q2, with more than 1/3 of the product revenue coming from software sales, driven by security module sales; GBB and software-only VE solutions. Security continues to be the growth driver of our business. We had a number of excellent wins last quarter, driven by our application security modules, with strong year-over-year growth in large transactions. 
For example, a global Fortune 25 company invested almost $1 million in the F5 APM solution to enable identity and access management for their employees into the Microsoft Office 365 environment. Also, we won a project with a U.S. regional airline, who invested nearly $1 million in our on-premise Web application firewall to help mitigate malicious and organic DDoS-oriented service interruptions. 
Another example was with a telco provider with more than 20 million subscribers, which made a significant investment in Silverline anti-DDoS services to thwart attacks orchestrated by an unidentified activist. 
We delivered solid sequential and year-over-year growth from Silverline, our cloud-based subscription DDOS and WAP security services. The pipeline for Silverline services continues to grow, and we continue to invest in additional headcount in sales and support resources to take advantage of this growth opportunity. 
We also launched an inside initiative in Q2 targeting the midrange market opportunity where there is real need for application and DDoS protection ideally suited to a subscription service model. We also had some excellent wins in the hybrid private and public cloud environments. A large European banking customer purchased over several hundred thousand dollars of VE subscription licenses through the AWS Marketplace for the deployment of a new customer engagement portal that coexist with the existing infrastructure and will ultimately support more than 10 million customers. 
A large SaaS customer invested in VE license through the AWS Marketplace to provision Layer 7 local traffic management capabilities on a new platform as a service offering to an installed base. Another cloud win last quarter involves a large U.S.-based entertainment content provider purchasing VE licenses through the AWS Marketplace as part of the lift and shift strategy to move their customer interaction operations into the public cloud. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $490 million to $500 million. In the context of several global macroeconomic issues, we delivered solid financial results in Q2. But as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. 
We have made good progress in all our strategic and major initiatives in Q2. As I mentioned last quarter, we have no shortage of short-term business drivers, which we will introduce starting this current quarter. Earlier this month, we introduced a new version of TMOS, version 12.1, known internally as a cascade release. Cascade supports a new 100-gig blade for high-end VIPRION series, which I will talk about shortly. Cascade also makes huge strides to increase F5's leadership in application programmability and application deployment. 
Cascade introduces F5's next-generation iRules and iApp functionality called iRules LX and iApps LX. IRules LX allows users to leverage node.js libraries to provide new functionality addressing the needs of the Dev Ops market as well as customer applications that need customization and programmability. 
IRules LX is based on the Linerate technology and is fully integrated into TMOS. IApps LX allows for easy programming of specific use cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used Web application programming language, JavaScript. IApps LX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN products, as it allows use cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ into the various SDN controllers, such as the Cisco, APEC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature, which should give F5 a clear advantage with our SDN partners. We are on track to deliver a new performance FIPS appliance and LME based on the BIG-IP 10K series appliances. It uses next generation technology, enabling an 8x improvement in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core requirements in both our financial services and the federal markets. 
We successfully demonstrated our 100-gig blade for the high-end VIPRION series platform at Mobile World Congress last quarter. The new VIPRION 100-gig interfaces more than doubles the performance of the existing cards, thereby enabling the first-ever terabit-class ADC in the market. We are seeing strong interest in the 100-gig blade from our global service providers and have already received an initial $1 million plus order for the product. The 100-gig blade is on track for delivery in May, and we would expect to see initial revenues from the 100-gig blade this quarter can come in Q3, with growing momentum in Q4 and into fiscal 2017.
The new blade runs all TMOS application modules and is targeted at service provider applications, including our Gi firewall, Carrier-Grade NAT and intelligent traffic steering. BIG-IQ release 5 is also on track for release this quarter, and we are very encouraged by the customer reaction to the new functionality and scalability improvement that are included in the release. 
Release 5 includes centralized management for all security products, including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi firewall and WebSafe antifraud. It also adds new device management capabilities, ADC management and application analytics. I mentioned in last quarter's call that we plan to expand our product portfolio by adding purpose-built security products, which will address new markets. The initial release will include an SSL intercept and SSL air gap solution as well as stand-alone -- as well as a stand-alone DDoS solution, with new behavioral and threat intelligence capabilities. There have been some small changes in the delivery schedule for these 2 products. The initial release of the SSL intercept and air gap products will now be available in early July and the stand-alone DDoS products should be available slightly earlier-than-expected with availability towards the end of this current quarter. 
It's worth noting that we have already 1 large SSL intercept project using our existing iRules on our current ADC range of products. The initial version of the stand-alone SSL intercept solution will use our existing iApp technology to allow a much simpler implementation. This will then be enhanced further by using the new iApp LX functionality in the later release. 
We're also making good progress to release a 40-gig capable version of our software VE solution. Intel demonstrated our F5 VE solution in 100-gig environment at Mobile World Congress and received a lot of interest from service providers, who have the goal of driving NFV architectures in the future. 
Progress on our plan to deliver a comprehensive appliance refresh is going well. And we are on track to commence delivery of the new products in July and have all products available within a 3 to 4-month window. The new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improve performance, decrease total cost of ownership and increase our competitive leadership. However, the shuttle series is much more than a simple product line upgrade. The shuttle series is Dev Ops friendly and encompasses a full stack of security solutions and offer specific persona-based customized solutions using our proprietary FPGA software-defined hardware functionality. The shuttle series will support our application modules across entire product lineup and are designed to support and enable 2-tier architectures, including hybrid clouds. 
Our higher level goal with the shuttle series is to bridge the gap between traditional IT, the Dev Ops environments and the emerging cloud architecture. I continue to believe F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. Our absolute focus is on execution with a primary goal of delivering product revenue growth. And I believe this goal will be achieved as we deliver the new product business drivers to the market. 
We have added several key executives to the F5 team last quarter to support and enhance our focus on execution. You may have seen recent press releases announcing the appointment of key sales and security executives to F5. I am really excited to have Pete Brant, David Helfer and Mike Convertino in the F5 team. Pete joins us as SVP for North American sales and brings with him a fantastic track record with more than 20 years of experience in technology and security sales. David joins us as VP of Worldwide Channels and brings extensive experience in global channels and sales operation, again with a fantastic track record. Mike is F5's first Chief Information Security Officer. His first priority is continued protection of the company's customer assets and data. Mike will also play a lead role in the development of F5 security products -- securities product roadmap and represent F5 in the IT industry and wider security community. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll hand the call over to Q&A."

I mean, over time, we've seen some disruption. And it's been well-publicized in management. I think that's behind us now. I talked about some of the hiring that John DiLullo in particular has done over the last couple of quarters. We've now got somebody back in charge in North America and feel really good about that.

So -- and though we don't guide much beyond the next quarter, where you see we said 84% for our non-GAAP gross margin, we expect to see strong gross margins continue and we'll manage it very carefully."

I mean, if you look at some of the hires that we're hiring, we're hiring more and more security people. And we've added significant security experts within the field to support the overall sales force. We've -- I've talked about Pete Brant with his background in security. Our new [indiscernible] -- so you'll see us doing more than that. I'm not going to say any specific spend. But it's a big focus to us because it's the future. We're also pushing ahead with the security research team as well. Because we do need to get more public about it. I mean, in fact, if you looked in the script today, we probably never really mentioned some of the security wins we've had during a call. We started to do that as well. So we do take that -- we take that input very seriously. In terms of the first question on the outside north -- outside of the Americas in terms of how the growth profile, I'm not sure it's directed at market share gain and/or customer penetration. I think, first of all, typically, when we penetrate, say, the times 200, that's a good thing because that means we do more and more business. So we love the concept of penetrating into existing customers. There's so many applications that we can sit in front and optimize. I don't think it's really that. I think that they've been executing well in a tough environment, obviously, but they've been executing well in those environments. We think -- with the changes we've been making, that John DiLullo has been making in sales in the Americas, you're going to see similar execution coming in the future as well."

Obviously, there's been a lot of concern among the investment community about your position relative to the cloud, Amazon in particular, but the cloud in general.

Any additional color around that -- I recognized you've been rejiggering your portfolio to optimize your cloud offerings to streamline and to get the right price points. Can you update us on where you are, how much more you need to do to get to where you want and need to be? And then a quick question for Andy. Andy, historically on Virtual Editions, I think you've referenced the fact that ASPs, you used to say they were 80% of the price point on hardware. I think more recently you referenced them as being comparable. But I think you've always said the net income impact was awash. I'm hoping you could update us. And one final question if I may, another number here. John, on the linearity issue, in your comments about enterprise demand, we had Ixia recently note that there was -- they saw meaningful downtick in the month of March from a number of com equipment suppliers. They didn't name them obviously. But and then in your comments, if I understood you correctly, the quarter started off slow coming out of the last quarter in January and February and there was a pickup in March, I'm just wondering if you could shed any more light in terms of the pattern as it speaks to forward business."

What we did see about that and I commented on was that we felt better about the visibility in March. In other words, by visibility, what I'm talking about is we look at -- we're looking at the pipeline in mainly the forecasted deals for that quarter and the visibility of that improved quite radically over the previous 2 quarters. We felt -- that's a combination probably of macro, but also of good sales management to make sure that we know what's going on. But that -- and that's important to us. So I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't put too much on the linearity thing because that was -- it wasn't widely different from what we would expect. It was a little bit soft in January and February, and we were a bit worried about the visibility. In other words, we felt we do a little bit better and we didn't. We felt we do a little better and we didn't. But we came to March and we felt that visibility was excellent. So that's -- oh, yes, on the AWS and the cloud and that question, I mean, I realized that a lot of concern and we discuss the stuff a lot internally. But when we look at the installed base and the customers and the opportunities, we see a lot with things like our WAP product, our APM product that I actually get 3 examples in fact, of that type of thing. So there are definitely opportunities there as well. But we've seen new business opportunities, where a fairly big companies where we had no presence and we managed to get into that company via AWS Marketplace interestingly enough. And obviously, we feel good about the whole hybrid side of things, especially going to be more and more focused on orchestration and areas like that. Having said all that, I do still think that it's been causing causing delay in spending overall. We also see some partnership ops -- opportunities with companies like Microsoft and Amazon, or AWS, in terms of working with them on enterprise customers. And we had one very good example of that. I mentioned the banking company, where that was an example of a partnership. Yes, I think it's early days. I mean, it's not that we -- we don't look at the pipeline right now and say, ""Oh! my God, this is shrinking because of Amazon."" We don't see that or because of the public cloud. There's no doubt in my mind, we probably don't get some business we've got before of a start-up company that go straight to the public cloud and maybe just instead of buying equipment just rent some software, that software could well be ours. But it's not critical. Yes, the major concern it gives us right now is, is it causing delays and then from an opportunity perspective, how can we maximize our product on those public clouds and by partnering with the cloud vendors."

And essentially, at our entry-level hardware systems, you do see parity on the gross margin dollar still. So it's not quite the same price wise, but it's equivalent on the gross margin dollars. And we're still seeing the deal sizes aren't necessarily smaller because usually, when they're buying virtual editions, they're deploying them on a more horizontal type of architecture. So they need more versions of it. So we're still in that kind of position. Some of the things I'd highlight though was we're looking at new licensing models specifically for the cloud. So bring your own license where you can take the VE and move it as you want to. Enterprise license agreements. If they want a license in large scale, we'll do an enterprise license agreement. And I think where we're coming out with a 40-gig VE. In an NFV environment, you may see that as well, where we do a lot of larger to enterprise-type license agreements, and then we'll see how that works out at discounting. And then we do offer on a utility basis, on AWS, the ability to pull out your credit card and license our virtual edition. So we'll continue to be looking at those business models to evolve them to the needs of our customers."

In his prepared remarks, John will discuss a number of new wins that reflect increasing adoption of our application delivery and security services for public and private cloud architectures. In addition, we are confident that the new products released in Q3 and those we are rolling out this quarter, including the BIG-IP appliance refresh, will become meaningful drivers of the business over the near and midterm. These, combined with progress we made in sales leadership and improving sales execution over this past year, give us confidence as we look to Q4 and beyond. 
Our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 is $515 million to $525 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 83% range, including approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84.5%.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $276 million to $285 million. This includes approximately $35.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 75 to 100 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $185 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,332689817,1008799,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q3 performance.

Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q3 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth with strong profitability, operating margins and cash flow in what continues to be a relatively challenging business environment. From a sales perspective, both Japan and our Asia Pacific regions delivered double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth. Sales bookings in our Americas regions were down year-over-year compared to a strong America booking quarter in Q3 fiscal 2015. We experienced softness in the service provider vertical, especially with some of the Tier 1 telco operators. However, the Americas sales results were above our internal forecast, and I was pleased with the progress we are seeing overall sales execution in the region. Sales bookings in EMEA were also down year-over-year driven by a weaker-than-expected results in the U.K. 
Once again, our Services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 13% and deferred revenue growth of 13%. Overall software revenues were very solid in Q3, accounting for 38% of overall product revenues with excellent growth in software sales and to public and hybrid cloud applications. Software revenues included -- include VE versions of TMOS and VE solution modules as well as solution modules shipped on our appliances and our VIPRION range of products. 
Security sales were up sequentially over Q2 with a number of excellent security wins across the entire portfolio of our security solutions. For example, a large financial services company used F5's SSL intercept capabilities to provide visibility to encrypted traffic and protect against the collection of both known and unknown advance attacks. This solution includes the service Channing of other vendors attack detection capabilities, including FireEye and networks and some of them our openness and integration capabilities. 
Another excellent security win driven by the Internet of Things trend involve a large Fortune 500 company leveraging our TCP optimization and WAP capabilities to scale and secure a 10,000-plus IoT deployment.
A large bank in EMEA acquired their best BIG-IP bundle to provide service consolidation of several critical functions: single sign-on, WAAF and DDoS mitigation. The customer also purchased our WebSafe anti-fraud product. The resulting solution had a material performance edge over competitors with significantly less expensive to deploy and the load to customer to realize ongoing savings due to the elegance and simplicity of F5 solutions. 
We also have increasing confidence following several excellent wins in the hybrid private and public cloud environments in Q3. When our existing customers initiate less than the shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. Similarly, new customers are implementing solutions such as our APM and WAAF modules to secure cloud-based applications. Some examples of hybrid and public cloud wins last quarter include a multinational pharmaceutical company, which elected to migrate its employees to the cloud-based Microsoft Office 365 plus platform and used F5 CPM activity to enable single sign-on and need to BIG-IP functionality to encrypt active directory financials. Similarly, a market leading SaaS vendor selected our BIG-IP virtualization to support the AWS customer-facing application. These VE instances were sized to support up to 200 megabits per second of throughput and the provision using only the native point-and-click capabilities of the AWS marketplace.
A large Department of Corrections organization replaced their legacy on-premise ADC vendor for F5 and performed a migration to the AWS cloud, incorporating a 200 megabits per second BIG-IP LTM solution together with an F5 application firewall. 
Lastly, a global executive sales and placement agency embarked in a project to migrate a large cluster of on-premise virtual machines to the Microsoft cloud. A smooth cloud transition was engineered by embracing a hybrid multiset migration plan and by leveraging F5 in the Azure cloud to manage application delivery and persistent connection requirements.
Last quarter, we introduced a number of new solutions and features into the market. In Q3, TMOS version 12.1 was released with next-generation programmability features designed to meet the emerging needs of the Dev Ops community. TMOS 12.1 also provides leading application services with enhanced public cloud integration and sophisticated security policies for on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. We also announced availability of our new FIPS security appliance, which not only meets the U.S. schedule information processing standards but also enjoys an eightfold increase in SSL performance over existing solutions. In June, we began shipping our 100-gig blade, enabling the first terabit class ADC. This product focuses on the service provider market offering significant performance improvement with Gi line applications such as the Gi firewall and traffic steering. Based on orders already taken combines growing pipeline, we see demand for -- we see demand ramping for the 100-gig blade in this coming quarter and into fiscal 2017. 
We delivered our latest management and orchestration products, BIG-IQ version 5.0 and iWorkflow version 2.0. BIG-IQ 5.0 delivers significant scalability improvements and centralized management for all the security products. F5's new 2.0 platform available as a virtual appliance accelerates the deployment of applications by orchestrating traffic management and security and hybrid cloud and SDN deployments.
Finally, we also delivered a new build in DDoS appliance called DDoS hybrid defender. This build DDoS solution is the first in a new line of security appliances. The DDoS hybrid defender is the only DDoS solution in the market that provides high-performance and true multilayer DDoS protections for applications, protocols and the network. Included in this solution is sophisticated application attack defense with in-depth behavioral analytics, fewer SSL decryption and the ability to integrate on-premise DDoS protection with optional cloud-based scrubbing via the F5 server line service. 
In this current quarter, we start the process of delivering a range of new appliances with a target of completing a comprehensive appliance refresh by the October and November time frame. As you would expect, the new appliances known internally as the Shuttle series significantly improved performance, decreased total cost of ownership and increased our competitive leadership position. However, the Shuttle CDs is much more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the Shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The Shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organization demand together with scale, security, investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed. Our high-level goal with the Shuttle series is to better meet the capacity the rapidly changing needs of the traditional ID -- IT buyer, the Dev Ops community and the growing ranks of enterprise cloud architects. We also plan to shift our new stand-alone SSL intercept product this quarter called the SSL orchestrator. The SSL orchestrator provides critical visibility into industry-wide spots created by the growing use of encryption for our enterprise networks. This product combines industry-leading cryptographic capabilities with context service chaining. It provides enhanced policy enforcement capabilities, sophisticated detection capabilities and improves network operations and orchestration. We're already seeing a rapidly growing requirement for this functionality. 
As far as fiscal 2016 Q4 outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $515 million to $525 million for this quarter. Given the political events in Europe last quarter combined with the relatively short spending environment overall, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. That being said, I believe we've made progress in a number of areas of this year that will result in the growth of our business as we close fiscal 2016 and head into fiscal 2017 October.
I also have a couple of organizational comments I want to share with you today. We announced today the appointment of our new Chief Marketing Officer, Ben Gibson. Ben's 25 years of management experience in enterprise IT and security makes him an excellent fit for the F5 team as is his exceptional track record of demand and brand creation and close partnership with both sales and product leadership. Ben joins us from Veritas where he led the company's rebranding efforts following the spin-off from Symantec. Prior to Veritas, Gibson spent 5 years as the Chief Marketing Officer at Aruba Networks. Before joining Aruba, Ben held VP roles at Cisco with a number of marketing teams focused on data center application networking and enterprise mobility technologies. With his official start at F5 on August 1, Ben's top priority will be on supporting our product revenue growth plans for the fiscal year ahead, and I expect he will bring new creativity and discipline to our product, field and channel marketing programs as well as advertising, digital strategy and corporate communication initiatives.
As I've mentioned several times over the last few quarters, it has always been my intention to return to retirement as some point in the future. At our board of directors meeting last week, the F5 board agreed at the time is right to initiate a formal set for my success when I retire as CEO of the company. We have se tup a formal committee to run this process and potential candidates. We have no specific targets in place but expect that this process may take 6 months or more to complete. Needless to say, I remain totally committed to the overall success of F5, including our #1 objective of returning to product revenue growth. I continue to believe F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements, and I want to reiterate my comments from last quarter. Throughout fiscal 2016, our absolute focus is on execution the primary goal of delivering product revenue growth, and I believe this goal be achieved as we deliver new product business drivers to the market. In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll now hand the call over to Q&A."

Hopefully we well win the shuffle and areas like that in then security is a pretty broad competence or landscape depending on what security solution we talk about. if you look at the application side of, which is our main focus in security, we've got a lot of uniqueness there. So I wouldn't really call it anything apart from specifically we're probably see more of space because that's what we're bringing to market now, and we think we've got to differentiation but nothing -- no big eye openers in the competitive front."

So 2 things I'm trying to understand. One is public cloud, a sense of how that's percent of your business or the trends there.

The reason you're hearing more about it is that we're doing good penetration about our security products like APM and the WAP. Our orchestration is becoming more important. When we've seen pieces of application move from a customer, say, to a public cloud then as I mentioned we're seeing things like programmability and still being just as critical. It's areas like that but we're still talking fairly small, really small numbers. The other thing is that both in the hybrid cloud and in the public cloud environment, remember, we are focused on the Fortune 500 customers 80% of the Fortune 500.

So one of the ones we picked up that we went after first DDoS. We have a best-of-breed solution there. We do things both at Layer 4, network-based, volumetric style attacks, and we also do things at the application layer. Very differentiated at the time these together seamlessly. Another big area has been SSL intercept. And as John mentioned in his script customers that can implement certain parts of this functionality natively in a ADC platforms but it requires a lot of programming things like that's actually get that to work so what we want to do is package that make it easy to deploy and use and have differentiations for that and charge separately for that the same thing with a carrier grade firewall that we announced, and this is just the first start off the line of products, we'll have other ones that we produce as time goes on as part of this have a laundry list of tings will have specific platforms and branding and everything else you'll see that announced later this year."

Revenue of $496.5 million grew 3% sequentially and 3% year-over-year and was in the upper end of our $490 million to $500 million guided range. 
GAAP EPS of $1.37 per share was above our guidance of $1.29 to $1.32 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.81 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Product revenue of $231.4 million, up 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year, represented 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $265.2 million increased 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue.
Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter; EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 15%; and Japan, 5%. U.S. revenue was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting relatively weak telco spending, and EMEA was down 1% as a result of softer-than-expected U.K. sales. By contrast, APAC revenue grew 20%, and Japan revenue was up 15% from the third quarter of last year.
Enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21%, and government sales were 15%, including 6% of total sales from U.S. Federal.
In Q3, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18.8%; Ingram Micro, which represented 14.9% of total revenue; and Avnet, representing 13.7%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5%. 
GAAP operating expenses were $273.3 million, at the low end of our guided range of $270 million to $279 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $239.2 million.
GAAP operating margin was 28%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 36.3%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 34.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.9%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $170.5 million. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $107.18 for a total of $150 million. $924 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments. DSO at the end of Q3 was 48 days. Inventories were $33.8 million. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $16.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $856.2 million. We ended Q3 with approximately 4,325 employees, up 5% year-over-year and flat with the prior quarter.
On to our Q4 outlook. In his prepared remarks, John will discuss a number of new wins that reflect increasing adoption of our application delivery and security services for public and private cloud architectures. In addition, we are confident that the new products released in Q3 and those we are rolling out this quarter, including the BIG-IP appliance refresh, will become meaningful drivers of the business over the near and mid-term. These, combined with progress we have made in sales leadership and improving sales execution over this past year, give us confidence as we look to Q4 and beyond. 
Our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 is $515 million to $525 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 83% range, including approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84.5%.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $276 million to $285 million. This includes approximately $35.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 75 to 100 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $185 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q3 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth with strong profitability, operating margins and cash flow in what continues to be a relatively challenging business environment.
From a sales perspective, both Japan and our Asia Pacific regions delivered double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth. Sales bookings in our Americas regions were down year-over-year compared to a strong Americas booking quarter in Q3 fiscal 2015. We experienced softness in the service provider vertical, especially with some of the Tier 1 telco operators. However, the Americas sales results were above our internal forecast, and I was pleased with the progress we are seeing in overall sales execution in the region. Sales bookings in EMEA were also down year-over-year driven by a weaker-than-expected results in the U.K. 
Once again, our Services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 13% and deferred revenue growth of 13%. Overall software revenues were very solid in Q3, accounting for 38% of overall product revenues, with excellent growth in software sales and to public and hybrid cloud applications. Software revenues included -- include VE versions of TMOS and VE solution modules as well as solution modules shipped on our appliances and our VIPRION range of products. 
Security sales were up sequentially over Q2, with a number of excellent security wins across the entire portfolio of our security solutions. For example, a large financial services company used F5's SSL intercept capabilities to provide visibility to encrypted outbound traffic and protect against the collection of both known and unknown advanced attacks. This solution included service chaining of other vendors' attack detection capabilities, including FireEye and Palo Alto Networks and further demonstrated our openness and integration capabilities.
Another excellent security win driven by the Internet of Things trend involved a large Fortune 500 company leveraging our TCP optimization and WAF capabilities to scale and secure a 10,000-plus IoT deployment.
A large bank in EMEA acquired out best BIG-IP bundle to provide service consolidation of several critical functions: single sign-on, WAF and DDoS mitigation. The customer also purchased our WebSafe anti-fraud product. The resulting solution had a material performance edge over competitors, with significantly less expensive to deploy and the load to customer to realize substantial ongoing savings due to the elegance and simplicity of F5 solutions. 
We also have increasing confidence following several excellent wins in the hybrid private and public cloud environments in Q3. When our existing customers initiate lift-and-shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. Similarly, new customers are implementing solutions such as our APM and WAF modules to secure their cloud-based applications. Some examples of hybrid and public cloud wins last quarter include a multinational pharmaceutical company, which elected to migrate its employees to the cloud-based Microsoft Office 365 platform and used F5's APM identity and access capabilities to enable single sign-on on native BIG-IP functionality to encrypt active directory credentials.
Similarly, a market-leading SaaS vendor selected our BIG-IP virtualization to support their AWS customer-facing application. These VE instances were sized to support up to 200 megabits per second of throughput and provisions using only the native point-and-click capabilities of the AWS Marketplace.
A large department of corrections organization replaced their legacy on-premise ADC vendor for F5 and performed a lift-and-shift migration to the AWS cloud incorporating a 200 megabits per second BIG-IP LTM solution together with an F5 application firewall. 
Lastly, a global executive search and placement agency embarked on a project to migrate a large cluster of on-premise virtual machines to the Microsoft Azure cloud. A smooth cloud transition was engineered by embracing a hybrid multiset migration plan and by leveraging F5 in the Azure cloud to manage all application delivery and persistent connection requirements.
Last quarter, we introduced a number of new solutions and features into the market. In Q3, TMOS version 12.1 was released with next-generation programmability features designed to meet the emerging needs of the Dev Ops community. TMOS 12.1 also provides leading application services with enhanced public cloud integration and sophisticated security policies for on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. We also announced availability of our new FIPS security appliance, which not only meets the U.S. Federal Information Processing Standards but also enjoys an eightfold increase in SSL performance over existing solutions.
In June, we began shipping our 100-gig blade, enabling the first terabit class ADC. This product focuses on the service provider market offering significant performance improvement with Gi LAN applications such as the Gi firewall and traffic steering. Based on orders already taken combined with our growing pipeline, we see demand for -- we see demand ramping for the 100-gig blade in this coming quarter and into fiscal 2017. 
We delivered our latest management and orchestration products, BIG-IQ version 5.0 and iWorkflow version 2.0. BIG-IQ 5.0 delivers significant scalability improvements and centralized management for all the security products. F5's new iWorkflow 2.0 platform available as a virtual appliance accelerates the deployment of applications by orchestrating traffic management and security in hybrid cloud and SDN deployments.
Finally, we also delivered a new purpose-built DDoS appliance called DDoS Hybrid Defender. This purpose-built DDoS solution is the first in a new line of purpose-built security appliances. The DDoS Hybrid Defender is the only DDoS solution in the market that provides high performance and true multilayer DDoS protections for applications, protocols and the network. Included in this solution is sophisticated application attack defense with in-depth behavioral analytics, full SSL decryption and the ability to integrate on-premise DDoS protection with optional cloud-based scrubbing via the F5 server line service.
In this current quarter, we start the process of delivering a range of new appliances with the target of completing a comprehensive appliance refresh by the October and November time frame. As you would expect, the new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improved performance, decreased total cost of ownership and increased our competitive leadership position. However, the shuttle series is much more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organizations demand together with the scale, security and investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
Our high-level goal with the shuttle series is to better meet the capacity the rapidly changing needs of the traditional ID -- IT buyer, the Dev Ops community and the growing ranks of enterprise cloud architects. We also plan to shift our new stand-alone SSL intercept product this quarter called the SSL Orchestrator. The SSL Orchestrator provides critical visibility into industry blind spots created by the growing use of encryption for our enterprise networks. This product combines industry-leading cryptographic capabilities with context-aware dynamic service chaining. It provides enhanced policy enforcement capabilities, sophisticated detection capabilities and improves network operations and orchestration. We're already seeing a rapidly growing requirement for this functionality. 
As far as fiscal 2016 Q4 outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $515 million to $525 million for this quarter. Given the political events in Europe last quarter combined with the relatively short spending environment overall, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. That being said, I believe we have made progress in a number of areas of this year that will result in the growth of our business as we close fiscal 2016 and head into fiscal 2017 in October.
I also have a couple of organizational comments I want to share with you today. We announced today the appointment of our new Chief Marketing Officer, Ben Gibson. Ben's 25 years of management experience in enterprise IT and security makes him an excellent fit for the F5 team as does his exceptional track record of demand and brand creation and close partnership with both sales and product leadership. Ben joins us from Veritas, where he led the company's rebranding efforts following the spin-off from Symantec. Prior to Veritas, Gibson spent 5 years as the Chief Marketing Officer at Aruba Networks. Before joining Aruba, Ben held VP roles at Cisco, where he led a number of marketing teams focused on data center application networking and enterprise mobility technologies. With his official start at F5 on August 1, Ben's top priority will be on supporting our product revenue growth plans for the fiscal year ahead, and I expect he will bring new creativity and discipline to our product, field and channel marketing programs as well as advertising, digital strategy and corporate communication initiatives.
As I have mentioned several times over the last few quarters, it has always been my intention to return to retirement at some point in the future. At our Board of Directors meeting last week, the F5 board agreed that the time was right to initiate a formal set for my successor when I retire as CEO of the company. We have set up a formal search committee to run this process and to vet potential candidates. We have no specific time targets in place but expect that this process may take 6 months or more to complete. Needless to say, I remain totally committed to the overall success of F5, including our number on objective of returning to product revenue growth.
I continue to believe that F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements, and I want to reiterate my comments from last quarter. Throughout fiscal 2016, our absolute focus is on execution with the primary goal of delivering product revenue growth, and I believe this goal will be achieved as we deliver new product business drivers to the market.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

We did have one example, and it's only one that I know of, of a customer actually placing a purchase order, halving the purchase order and then deciding that to want to take it back completely. That was all due. We didn't ship or take revenue. That was just a proxy purchase server. I'm not implying we extrapolate that across the whole of that quantity market but that did happen.

I mean it really is the infancy in terms of the opportunity. However, we understand it's very real. The reason you're hearing more about it is that we're doing good penetration with our security products like APM and the WAF. Our orchestration is becoming more important. When we've seen pieces of application move from a customer, say, to a public cloud then as I mentioned we're seeing things like programmability and iRules still being just as critical. It's areas like that but we're talking -- we're still talking fairly small, really fair small numbers. The other thing is that both in the hybrid cloud and in the public cloud environment, remember, we are focused on the Fortune 500 customers 80% of the Fortune 500. They are asking us to help them from an architecture and an implementation perspective, so that gives us an advantage in that area as well."

And what we wanted to do is create a differentiated offering that allowed us to go out and drive essentially towards these to better position ourselves with the security buying centers in the enterprise's card et cetera. And so we picked essentially functions, if you will, or products that our field had been asking us for to differentiate we thought that there was a broad adoption of it. So one of the ones we picked up that we went after first DDoS. We have a best-of-breed solution there. We do things both at Layer 4, network-based, volumetric style attacks, and we also do things at the application layer. So it's differentiated that we tie these together seamlessly. Another big area has been SSL intercept. And as John mentioned in his script, we've had customers that can implement certain parts of this functionality natively on our ADC platforms but it requires a lot of programming like iRules things like that to actually get that to work. So what we want to do is package that make it easy to deploy and use and have differentiations specifically for that and charge separately for that and the same thing with the carrier-grade firewall that we announced, and this is just the first start of kind of the of products. We'll have other ones that we produce as time goes on as part of this we have a whole laundry list of tings, and we'll have specific platforms and branding and everything else that, that will go out as part of that.

Revenue of $496.5 million grew 3% sequentially and 3% year-over-year and was in the upper end of our $490 million to $500 million guided range. 
GAAP EPS of $1.37 per share was above our guidance of $1.29 to $1.32 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.81 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Product revenue of $231.4 million, up 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year, represented 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $265.2 million increased 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue.
Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter; EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 15%; and Japan, 5%. U.S. revenue was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting relatively weak telco spending, and EMEA was down 1% as a result of softer-than-expected U.K. sales. By contrast, APAC revenue grew 20%, and Japan revenue was up 15% from the third quarter of last year.
Enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21%, and government sales were 15%, including 6% of total sales from U.S. Federal.
In Q3, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18.8%; Ingram Micro, which represented 14.9% of total revenue; and Avnet, representing 13.7%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5%. 
GAAP operating expenses were $273.3 million, at the low end of our guided range of $270 million to $279 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $239.2 million.
GAAP operating margin was 28%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 36.3%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 34.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.9%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $170.5 million. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $107.18 for a total of $150 million. $924 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments. DSO at the end of Q3 was 48 days. Inventories were $33.8 million. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $16.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $856.2 million. We ended Q3 with approximately 4,325 employees, up 5% year-over-year and flat with the prior quarter.
On to our Q4 outlook. In his prepared remarks, John will discuss a number of new wins that reflect increasing adoption of our application delivery and security services for public and private cloud architectures. In addition, we are confident that the new products released in Q3 and those we are rolling out this quarter, including the BIG-IP appliance refresh, will become meaningful drivers of the business over the near and mid-term. These, combined with progress we have made in sales leadership and improving sales execution over this past year, give us confidence as we look to Q4 and beyond. 
Our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 is $515 million to $525 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 83% range, including approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84.5%.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $276 million to $285 million. This includes approximately $35.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 75 to 100 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $185 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q3 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth with strong profitability, operating margins and cash flow in what continues to be a relatively challenging business environment.
From a sales perspective, both Japan and our Asia Pacific regions delivered double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth. Sales bookings in our Americas regions were down year-over-year compared to a strong Americas booking quarter in Q3 fiscal 2015. We experienced softness in the service provider vertical, especially with some of the Tier 1 telco operators. However, the Americas sales results were above our internal forecast, and I was pleased with the progress we are seeing in overall sales execution in the region. Sales bookings in EMEA were also down year-over-year driven by a weaker-than-expected results in the U.K. 
Once again, our Services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 13% and deferred revenue growth of 15%. Overall software revenues were very solid in Q3, accounting for 38% of overall product revenues, with excellent growth in software sales and to public and hybrid cloud architectures. Software revenues included -- include VE versions of TMOS and VE solution modules as well as solution modules shipped on our appliances and our VIPRION range of products. 
Security sales were up sequentially over Q2, with a number of excellent security wins across the entire portfolio of our security solutions. For example, a large financial services company used F5's SSL intercept capabilities to provide visibility to encrypted outbound traffic and protect against the collection of both known and unknown advanced attacks. This solution included service chaining of other vendors' attack detection capabilities, including FireEye and Palo Alto Networks and further demonstrated our openness and integration capabilities.
Another excellent security win driven by the Internet of Things trend involved a large Fortune 500 company leveraging our TCP optimization and WAF capabilities to scale and secure a 10,000-plus IoT deployment.
A large bank in EMEA acquired out best BIG-IP bundle to provide service consolidation of several critical functions: single sign-on, WAF and DDoS mitigation. The customer also purchased our WebSafe anti-fraud product. The resulting solution had a material performance edge over competitors, was significantly less expensive to deploy and allowed the customer to realize substantial ongoing savings due to the elegance and simplicity of F5 solutions. 
We also have increasing confidence following several excellent wins in the hybrid private and public cloud environments in Q3. When our existing customers initiate lift-and-shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. Similarly, new customers are implementing solutions such as our APM and WAF modules to secure their cloud-based applications. Some examples of hybrid and public cloud wins last quarter include a multinational pharmaceutical company, which elected to migrate its employees to the cloud-based Microsoft Office 365 platform and used F5's APM identity and access capabilities to enable single sign-on and native BIG-IP functionality to encrypt active directory credentials.
Similarly, a market-leading SaaS vendor selected our BIG-IP virtualization to support their AWS customer-facing application. These VE instances were sized to support up to 200 megabits per second of throughput and provisions using only the native point-and-click capabilities of the AWS Marketplace.
A large department of corrections organization replaced their legacy on-premise ADC vendor for F5 and performed a lift-and-shift migration to the AWS cloud incorporating a 200 megabits per second BIG-IP LTM solution together with an F5 application firewall. 
Lastly, a global executive search and placement agency embarked on a project to migrate a large cluster of on-premise virtual machines to the Microsoft Azure cloud. A smooth cloud transition was engineered by embracing a hybrid multiset migration plan and by leveraging F5 in the Azure cloud to manage all application delivery and persistent connection requirements.
Last quarter, we introduced a number of new solutions and features into the market. In Q3, TMOS version 12.1 was released with next-generation programmability features designed to meet the emerging needs of the Dev Ops community. TMOS 12.1 also provides leading application services with enhanced public cloud integration and sophisticated security policies for on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. We also announced availability of our new FIPS security appliance, which not only meets the U.S. Federal Information Processing Standards but also enjoys an eightfold increase in SSL performance over existing solutions.
In June, we began shipping our 100-gig blade, enabling the first terabit class ADC. This product focuses on the service provider market offering significant performance improvement with Gi LAN applications such as the Gi firewall and traffic steering. Based on orders already taken combined with our growing pipeline, we see demand for -- we see demand ramping for the 100-gig blade in this coming quarter and into fiscal 2017. 
We delivered our latest management and orchestration products, BIG-IQ version 5.0 and iWorkflow version 2.0. BIG-IQ 5.0 delivers significant scalability improvements and centralized management for all the security products. F5's new iWorkload (sic) [iWorkflow] 2.0 platform available as a virtual appliance accelerates the deployment of applications by orchestrating traffic management and security in hybrid cloud and SDN deployments.
Finally, we also delivered a new purpose-built DDoS appliance called DDoS Hybrid Defender. This purpose-built DDoS solution is the first in a new line of purpose-built security appliances. The DDoS Hybrid Defender is the only DDoS solution in the market that provides high performance and true multilayer DDoS protections for applications, protocols and the network. Included in this solution is sophisticated application attack defense with in-depth behavioral analytics, full SSL decryption and the ability to integrate on-premise DDoS protection with optional cloud-based scrubbing via the F5 Silverline service.
In this current quarter, we start the process of delivering a range of new appliances with the target of completing a comprehensive appliance refresh by the October and November time frames. As you would expect, the new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improved performance, decreased total cost of ownership and increased our competitive leadership position. However, the shuttle series is much more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organizations demand together with the scale, security, investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
Our high-level goal with the shuttle series is to better meet the capacity the rapidly changing needs of the traditional ID -- IT buyer, the Dev Ops community and the growing ranks of enterprise cloud architects. We also plan to ship our new stand-alone SSL intercept product this quarter called the SSL Orchestrator. The SSL Orchestrator provides critical visibility into industry blind spots created by the growing use of encryption for our enterprise networks. This product combines industry-leading cryptographic capabilities with context-aware dynamic service chaining. It provides enhanced and policy enforcement capabilities, sophisticated detection capabilities and improves network operations and orchestration. We're already seeing a rapidly growing requirement for this functionality. 
As far as the fiscal 2016 Q4 outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $515 million to $525 million for this quarter. Given the political events in Europe last quarter combined with the relatively soft spending environment overall, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. That being said, I believe we have made progress in a number of areas this year that will result in the growth of our business as we close fiscal 2016 and head into fiscal 2017 in October.
I also have a couple of organizational comments I want to share with you today. We announced today the appointment of our new Chief Marketing Officer, Ben Gibson. Ben's 25 years of management experience in enterprise IT and security makes him an excellent fit for the F5 team as does his exceptional track record of demand and brand creation and close partnership with both sales and product leadership. Ben joins us from Veritas, where he led the company's rebranding efforts following the spin-off from Symantec. Prior to Veritas, Gibson spent 5 years as the Chief Marketing Officer at Aruba Networks. Before joining Aruba, Ben held VP roles at Cisco, where he led a number of marketing teams focused on data center application networking and enterprise mobility technologies. With his official start at F5 on August 1, Ben's top priority will be on supporting our product revenue growth plans for the fiscal year ahead, and I expect he will bring new creativity and discipline to our product, field and channel marketing programs as well as advertising, digital strategy and corporate communication initiatives.
As I have mentioned several times over the last few quarters, it has always been my intention to return to retirement at some point in the future. At our Board of Directors meeting last week, the F5 board agreed that the time was right to initiate a formal set for my successor when I retire as CEO of the company. We have set up a formal search committee to run this process and to vet potential candidates. We have no specific time targets in place but expect that this process may take 6 months or more to complete. Needless to say, I remain totally committed to the overall success of F5, including our number one objective of returning to product revenue growth.
I continue to believe that F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements, and I want to reiterate my comments from last quarter. Throughout fiscal 2016, our absolute focus is on execution with the primary goal of delivering product revenue growth, and I believe this goal will be achieved as we deliver new product business drivers to the market.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

I think, just given that scenario, we feel that we should be reasonably cautious when we look at the forecast that we get from our sales organization and how we think the business is going. In terms of the linearity, it was pretty smooth. Really, no surprises. We didn't see any -- it was really normal linearity, which for us we like that a lot, and that was almost on a weekly basis as well in the quarter."

Now, they've had great track record up until that, but that was EMEA. And U.K. actually was down fairly significantly. We think that's probably Brexit related. But remember, by Brexit related that could be currency related. It could be a number of things. We did have one example, and it's only one that I know of, of a customer actually placing a purchase order, halving the purchase order and then deciding that they want to take it back completely. That was all due in the quarter. We didn't ship it or take revenue on it or anything like that. It was just a purchase order. I'm not implying we extrapolate that across the whole of that U.K. market but that did happen. So we think there was some impact and time will tell now as you look forward to this quarter as well, that was just a sudden impact given the result or it's going to be a longer impact.

So there's a few reasons for us to go off and drive towards this, and one was that we wanted to -- today, essentially we have an ADC platform that provides best-of-breed security, especially application security identity access management, but it doesn't necessarily lend itself well to going and targeting specific areas within the security buying centers. And what we wanted to do is create a differentiated offering that allowed us to go out and drive essentially towards these to better position ourselves with the security buying centers in the enterprise's cloud, et cetera. And so we picked essentially functions, if you will, or products that our field had been asking us for to differentiate and we thought that there was a broad -- there'd be broad adoption of. And so one of the ones we picked up, that we went after first, DDoS. We have a best-of-breed solution there. We do things both at Layer 4, network-based, volumetric style attacks, and we also do things at the application layer. And it's very differentiated that we tie these together seamlessly. Another big area has been SSL intercept. And as John mentioned in his script, we've had customers that can implement certain parts of this functionality natively on our ADC platforms but it requires a lot of programming, iRules, things like that, to actually get that to work. So what we wanted to do is package that, make it easy to deploy and use and have differentiations specifically for that and then charge separately for that. And the same thing with the carrier-grade firewall that we had announced. And this is just the first start of kind of a line of products. We'll have other ones that we produce as time goes on. As part of this, we have a whole laundry list of things, and we'll have specific platforms and branding and everything else that, that will go out as part of that.

Revenue of $496.5 million grew 3% sequentially and 3% year-over-year and was in the upper end of our $490 million to $500 million guided range. 
GAAP EPS of $1.37 per share was above our guidance of $1.29 to $1.32 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.81 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Product revenue of $231.4 million, up 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year, represented 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $265.2 million increased 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue.
Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter; EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 15%; and Japan, 5%. U.S. revenue was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting relatively weak telco spending, and EMEA was down 1% as a result of softer-than-expected U.K. sales. By contrast, APAC revenue grew 20%, and Japan revenue was up 15% from the third quarter of last year.
Enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21%, and government sales were 15%, including 6% of total sales from U.S. Federal.
In Q3, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18.8%; Ingram Micro, which represented 14.9% of total revenue; and Avnet, representing 13.7%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5%. 
GAAP operating expenses were $273.3 million, at the low end of our guided range of $270 million to $279 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $239.2 million.
GAAP operating margin was 28%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 36.3%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 34.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.9%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $170.5 million. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $107.18 for a total of $150 million. $924 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments. DSO at the end of Q3 was 48 days. Inventories were $33.8 million. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $16.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $856.2 million. We ended Q3 with approximately 4,325 employees, up 5% year-over-year and flat with the prior quarter.
On to our Q4 outlook. In his prepared remarks, John will discuss a number of new wins that reflect increasing adoption of our application delivery and security services for public and private cloud architectures. In addition, we are confident that the new products released in Q3 and those we are rolling out this quarter, including the BIG-IP appliance refresh, will become meaningful drivers of the business over the near and mid-term. These, combined with progress we have made in sales leadership and improving sales execution over this past year, give us confidence as we look to Q4 and beyond. 
Our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 is $515 million to $525 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 83% range, including approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84.5%.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $276 million to $285 million. This includes approximately $35.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 75 to 100 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $185 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q3 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth with strong profitability, operating margins and cash flow in what continues to be a relatively challenging business environment.
From a sales perspective, both Japan and our Asia Pacific regions delivered double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth. Sales bookings in our Americas regions were down year-over-year compared to a strong Americas booking quarter in Q3 fiscal 2015. We experienced softness in the service provider vertical, especially with some of the Tier 1 telco operators. However, the Americas sales results were above our internal forecast, and I was pleased with the progress we are seeing in overall sales execution in the region. Sales bookings in EMEA were also down year-over-year driven by a weaker-than-expected results in the U.K. 
Once again, our Services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 13% and deferred revenue growth of 15%. Overall software revenues were very solid in Q3, accounting for 38% of overall product revenues, with excellent growth in software sales and to public and hybrid cloud architectures. Software revenues included -- include VE versions of TMOS and VE solution modules as well as solution modules shipped on our appliances and our VIPRION range of products. 
Security sales were up sequentially over Q2, with a number of excellent security wins across the entire portfolio of our security solutions. For example, a large financial services company used F5's SSL intercept capabilities to provide visibility to encrypted outbound traffic and protect against the collection of both known and unknown advanced attacks. This solution included service chaining of other vendors' attack detection capabilities, including FireEye and Palo Alto Networks and further demonstrated our openness and integration capabilities.
Another excellent security win driven by the Internet of Things trend involved a large Fortune 500 company leveraging our TCP optimization and WAF capabilities to scale and secure a 10,000-plus IoT deployment.
A large bank in EMEA acquired out best BIG-IP bundle to provide service consolidation of several critical functions: single sign-on, WAF and DDoS mitigation. The customer also purchased our WebSafe anti-fraud product. The resulting solution had a material performance edge over competitors, was significantly less expensive to deploy and allowed the customer to realize substantial ongoing savings due to the elegance and simplicity of F5 solutions. 
We also have increasing confidence following several excellent wins in the hybrid private and public cloud environments in Q3. When our existing customers initiate lift-and-shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. Similarly, new customers are implementing solutions such as our APM and WAF modules to secure their cloud-based applications. Some examples of hybrid and public cloud wins last quarter include a multinational pharmaceutical company, which elected to migrate its employees to the cloud-based Microsoft Office 365 platform and used F5's APM identity and access capabilities to enable single sign-on and native BIG-IP functionality to encrypt active directory credentials.
Similarly, a market-leading SaaS vendor selected our BIG-IP virtualization to support their AWS customer-facing application. These VE instances were sized to support up to 200 megabits per second of throughput and provisions using only the native point-and-click capabilities of the AWS Marketplace.
A large department of corrections organization replaced their legacy on-premise ADC vendor for F5 and performed a lift-and-shift migration to the AWS cloud incorporating a 200 megabits per second BIG-IP LTM solution together with an F5 application firewall. 
Lastly, a global executive search and placement agency embarked on a project to migrate a large cluster of on-premise virtual machines to the Microsoft Azure cloud. A smooth cloud transition was engineered by embracing a hybrid multiset migration plan and by leveraging F5 in the Azure cloud to manage all application delivery and persistent connection requirements.
Last quarter, we introduced a number of new solutions and features into the market. In Q3, TMOS version 12.1 was released with next-generation programmability features designed to meet the emerging needs of the Dev Ops community. TMOS 12.1 also provides leading application services with enhanced public cloud integration and sophisticated security policies for on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. We also announced availability of our new FIPS security appliance, which not only meets the U.S. Federal Information Processing Standards but also enjoys an eightfold increase in SSL performance over existing solutions.
In June, we began shipping our 100-gig blade, enabling the first terabit class ADC. This product focuses on the service provider market offering significant performance improvement with Gi LAN applications such as the Gi firewall and traffic steering. Based on orders already taken combined with our growing pipeline, we see demand for -- we see demand ramping for the 100-gig blade in this coming quarter and into fiscal 2017. 
We delivered our latest management and orchestration products, BIG-IQ version 5.0 and iWorkflow version 2.0. BIG-IQ 5.0 delivers significant scalability improvements and centralized management for all the security products. F5's new iWorkload (sic) [ iWorkflow ] 2.0 platform available as a virtual appliance accelerates the deployment of applications by orchestrating traffic management and security in hybrid cloud and SDN deployments.
Finally, we also delivered a new purpose-built DDoS appliance called DDoS Hybrid Defender. This purpose-built DDoS solution is the first in a new line of purpose-built security appliances. The DDoS Hybrid Defender is the only DDoS solution in the market that provides high performance and true multilayer DDoS protections for applications, protocols and the network. Included in this solution is sophisticated application attack defense with in-depth behavioral analytics, full SSL decryption and the ability to integrate on-premise DDoS protection with optional cloud-based scrubbing via the F5 Silverline service.
In this current quarter, we start the process of delivering a range of new appliances with the target of completing a comprehensive appliance refresh by the October and November time frames. As you would expect, the new appliances known internally as the shuttle series significantly improved performance, decreased total cost of ownership and increased our competitive leadership position. However, the shuttle series is much more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organizations demand together with the scale, security, investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
Our high-level goal with the shuttle series is to better meet the capacity the rapidly changing needs of the traditional ID -- IT buyer, the Dev Ops community and the growing ranks of enterprise cloud architects. We also plan to ship our new stand-alone SSL intercept product this quarter called the SSL Orchestrator. The SSL Orchestrator provides critical visibility into industry blind spots created by the growing use of encryption for our enterprise networks. This product combines industry-leading cryptographic capabilities with context-aware dynamic service chaining. It provides enhanced policy enforcement capabilities, sophisticated detection capabilities and improves network operations and orchestration. We're already seeing a rapidly growing requirement for this functionality. 
As far as the fiscal 2016 Q4 outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $515 million to $525 million for this quarter. Given the political events in Europe last quarter combined with the relatively soft spending environment overall, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short term. That being said, I believe we have made progress in a number of areas this year that will result in the growth of our business as we close fiscal 2016 and head into fiscal 2017 in October.
I also have a couple of organizational comments I want to share with you today. We announced today the appointment of our new Chief Marketing Officer, Ben Gibson. Ben's 25 years of management experience in enterprise IT and security makes him an excellent fit for the F5 team as does his exceptional track record of demand and brand creation and close partnership with both sales and product leadership. Ben joins us from Veritas, where he led the company's rebranding efforts following the spin-off from Symantec. Prior to Veritas, Gibson spent 5 years as the Chief Marketing Officer at Aruba Networks. Before joining Aruba, Ben held VP roles at Cisco, where he led a number of marketing teams focused on data center application networking and enterprise mobility technologies. With his official start at F5 on August 1, Ben's top priority will be on supporting our product revenue growth plans for the fiscal year ahead, and I expect he will bring new creativity and discipline to our product, field and channel marketing programs as well as advertising, digital strategy and corporate communication initiatives.
As I have mentioned several times over the last few quarters, it has always been my intention to return to retirement at some point in the future. At our Board of Directors meeting last week, the F5 board agreed that the time was right to initiate a formal set for my successor when I retire as CEO of the company. We have set up a formal search committee to run this process and to vet potential candidates. We have no specific time targets in place but expect that this process may take 6 months or more to complete. Needless to say, I remain totally committed to the overall success of F5, including our number one objective of returning to product revenue growth.
I continue to believe that F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements, and I want to reiterate my comments from last quarter. Throughout fiscal 2016, our absolute focus is on execution with the primary goal of delivering product revenue growth, and I believe this goal will be achieved as we deliver new product business drivers to the market.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

We're happy with ours. There's still low percentage versus what they used to be 5 or 6 years ago. It's really that. I think, just given that scenario, we feel that we should be reasonably cautious when we look at the forecast that we get from our sales organization and how we think the business is going. In terms of the linearity, it was pretty smooth. Really, no surprises. We didn't see any -- it was really normal linearity, which for us we like that a lot, and that was almost on a weekly basis as well in the quarter."

Now, they've had great track record up until that, but that was EMEA. And U.K. actually was down fairly significantly. We think that's probably Brexit related. But remember, by Brexit related that could be currency related. It could be a number of things. We did have one example, and it's only one that I know of, of a customer actually placing a purchase order, halving the purchase order and then deciding that they want to take it back completely. That was all due in the quarter. We didn't ship it or take revenue on it or anything like that. It was just a purchase order. I'm not implying we extrapolate that across the whole of that U.K. market but that did happen. So we think there was some impact and time will tell now as you look forward to this quarter as well, that was just a sudden impact given the result or it's going to be a longer impact.

So there's a few reasons for us to go off and drive towards this, and one was that we wanted to -- today, essentially we have an ADC platform that provides best-of-breed security, especially application security identity access management, but it doesn't necessarily lend itself well to going and targeting specific areas within the security buying centers. And what we wanted to do is create a differentiated offering that allowed us to go out and drive essentially towards these to better position ourselves with the security buying centers in the enterprise's cloud, et cetera. And so we picked essentially functions, if you will, or products that our field had been asking us for to differentiate and we thought that there was a broad -- there'd be broad adoption of. And so one of the ones we picked up, that we went after first, DDoS. We have a best-of-breed solution there. We do things both at Layer 4, network-based, volumetric style attacks, and we also do things at the application layer. And it's very differentiated that we tie these together seamlessly. Another big area has been SSL intercept. And as John mentioned in his script, we've had customers that can implement certain parts of this functionality natively on our ADC platforms but it requires a lot of programming, iRules, things like that, to actually get that to work. So what we wanted to do is package that, make it easy to deploy and use and have differentiations specifically for that and then charge separately for that. And the same thing with the carrier-grade firewall that we had announced. And this is just the first start of kind of a line of products. We'll have other ones that we produce as time goes on. As part of this, we have a whole laundry list of things, and we'll have specific platforms and branding and everything else that, that will go out as part of that. You'll see that announced later this year."

F5 closed fiscal 2016 with a strong finish. Both revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 came in above our guidance as a result of solid year-over-year sales growth in the Americas, APAC and Japan and healthy demand for our existing products ahead of our appliance refresh that begun rolling out in mid-September.
Revenue of $525.3 million was up 6% from the prior quarter and 5% year-over-year and above our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. GAAP EPS was $1.64 per share, above our guidance of $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.11 also exceeded our guidance of $1.92 to $1.95 per share. Q4 product revenue of $253 million, up 9% from Q3 and down 2% from Q4 of last year, represented 48% of revenue. Service revenue of $272.4 million increased 3% sequentially, 12% year-over-year and accounted for 52% of revenue. On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 4% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, increased 1% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue was up 13% from a year ago. 
During the quarter, enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales. Service providers accounted for 18%, and government sales were 18%, including 10% from U.S. federal.
In Q4, we had 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.2%; and Avnet at 12.5%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $277.8 million were at the low end of our $276 million to $285 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $242.7 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.9%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.16 billion at year-end. DSO was 46 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.6 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $34.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $870.2 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.31 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. And in Q4, we increased our headcount by 70 employees to 4,395. 
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2016 was just under $2 billion, up 4% from fiscal 2015. Product revenue of $944.5 million was down 5% from the prior year and accounted for 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $1.05 billion grew 13% during the year and represented 53% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2016 was $365.9 million or $5.38 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $496.2 million or $7.30 per share. And for all of fiscal 2016, cash flow from operations totaled $712 million.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '17 outlook. We are encouraged by increasing customer demand for all the new products we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016, in particular for our new family of BIG-IP appliances, the Shuttle series, which we launched in September. We expect to finish the rollout of these products in November, and we anticipate a steady ramp in sales as they replace sales of our existing appliance family over the course of this year. 
As we look to Q1, we expect to see the normal seasonality that accompanies the start of a new fiscal year. In addition, we anticipate a continued challenging sales environment within EMEA over the short term, particularly in the U.K., which we have also factored in when assessing our revenue expectations for Q1.
With that in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we are targeting revenue in a range of $510 million to $520 million. We expect the GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expense of $285 million to $294 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.40 to $1.43 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations at or around $200 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by 60 to 80 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows. From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 84% to 85% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing to the upper 30s range for the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions.
And finally, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 32% to 34% on a GAAP basis and 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis for the year. As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor Meeting will be November 17 in Chicago. We hope you can join us for this in-depth look at our business and our plans for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,332690128,1062160,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone.

Overall, I was very pleased with th",1443,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss the Q4 results in some detail and then outline the progress we have made during fiscal 2016 towards our goal of returning product revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q4 performance, including record revenues of $525 million, record cash from operations of $204 million and record profitability with 39% non-GAAP operating margin. 
Many of the process systems and training investments that we made throughout the year and our go-to-market engine together with the significant addition of new sales and marketing leadership talent began to bear fruit in fiscal Q4. I'm especially encouraged by the improvement in sales execution last quarter from the Americas region, which returned to year-over-year sales growth for the first time in several quarters. I view this as a significant milestone on our path to delivering consistent product revenue growth. I was also happy with the results of our Japan and our Asia Pacific regions, which both fell year-over-year sales bookings growth in the quarter and the entire fiscal year. 
Sales bookings in EMEA, however, were again down year-over-year, driven by weak sales in the U.K. Once again, our Services business delivered strong results and an excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 12%. As well as providing world class customer satisfaction, our service business has been crucial to our profitability throughout fiscal 2016.
We believe that our several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with enterprise and service provider customers in Q4. Firstly, customers are increasingly leveraging our products, not only for native security features but also for the ability of our products to orchestrate and Intercept SSL traffic rules. Hackers today are more often leveraging SSL traffic for malware delivery thereby making the F5 SSL Orchestrator and inspection capabilities more and more relevant. For example, a $5 billion health care organization deployed F5's iHealth application and in so doing determined that 93% of its data center traffic was encrypted and that its existing perimeter firewalls were being defeated by a flood of malicious and nonmalicious traffic. The ultimate resolution included deploying an F5 ee-based SSL solution, working in tandem with a Cisco intrusion prevention offering. This collaborative SSL filtration solution was repeated more than a dozen times this quarter in several large global enterprises.
Similarly, we experienced real traction with our anti-fraud WebSafe platforms in Q4. We believe this reflects both the increasing sophistication of bad actors focused on credential theft as well as the explosion of SSL traffic in the transport of the email and other enterprise and public messaging applications. Our WebSafe product is very effective over SSL encrypted traffic, giving F5 very strong competitive differentiation with these solutions. We had a large win in Q4 with an Australian bank who leveraged our WebSafe and mobile safe anti-fraud capabilities to facilitate the protection of 10 million domestic and international banking customers. The F5 solution provides a client risk private cloud capability to the bank, which uniquely met the requirements of the ever-growing mobile banking clientele. 
Our second emerging trend is the growth opportunity we are experiencing with customers provisioning our proxy-based security solutions to deploy a consistent security stack and security policies across on-premise, off-premise and public cloud infrastructure such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. A multinational airline was suffering from brute force attacks against its web-based and private cloud assets. This customer leveraged a combination of our ASM and server line WAF as a service offerings to mitigate unwanted and help them meet end customer service delivery expectations. This solution provided a set of IT administration abilities across its hybrid, public and private cloud environments thus reducing management complexity and total cost of ownership.
Similarly, 2 different banks in our Asia Pacific data deployed BIG-IP ASM modules within the AWS environment to facilitate a public cloud migration of several customer-facing Internet banking sites. Our solution allowed both banks to duplicate both their ASM functionality and their home built library of fire rules that they have optimized in their own premise data center for use in the public cloud. As we gain more and more experience of customers using F5 solutions to move their apps and what goes to public and private cloud architectures, we are convinced that this is yet a third market trend with significant opportunities for F5. Within our existing customers -- I'm sorry, when our existing customers initiate lift and shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, we continue to view rich F5 ADC functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. For example, an international provider of SaaS-based workforce automation solutions leveraged a virtualization traffic management capabilities and AWS environment to activate remote instances of the product in Canada, Australia and the United kingdom. Working together, AWS and F5 helped the customer emulate the traffic management protocol and reuse the on-premise configuration details they had optimized and over time. The resulting solution greatly reduced the latency of the international customers have been experiencing when accessing the application remotely. This trend was reinforced when our U.S.-based provider of entertainment media and streaming content deployed their ADC solution in the Amazon Web Services environment. Our cloud-based solution allows for rapid activation of additional streaming sessions during on-demand style broadcast when subscriber demand significantly exceeded expectations. The content of these events is primarily delivered by the customer's private cloud. However, this joint F5 and AWS solution provided for a standby capacity leveraging a hybrid cloud architecture.
From a product perspective, we delivered on our goal to commence shipments of a new range of appliances in Q4. This new product lineup, known internally as the Shuttle series, is perhaps the most comprehensive range of new products we have delivered to the market. We started shipping the high-end products in the final weeks of the quarter, and we expect to have the entire product range available by the end of November. As I have mentioned before, the Shuttle series is more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the Shuttle series the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The Shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organization demand together with the scale, security, investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
In our quarterly conference call last January when we announced our Q1 results, I gave a high-level be of the significant array of new products we had in the road map for delivery in fiscal 2016. The Shuttle series capped a tremendous suite of product introductions in fiscal 2016, which will provide solid business drivers in the current fiscal year, enabling the F5 team to achieve our goal of delivering product revenue growth throughout the year. We saw a very good traction in sales of our new 100 gig blade last quarter, and it was exciting to see a significant number of these sales taking advantage of the 100 gig blades world-class performance to enhance solutions like the G.I. firewall. Security, G.I. line consolidation, NFV solutions, traffic and TCP optimization continue to be successfully focused for F5 in the service provider market. 
Our vast array of new products, including the Shuttle series, the SSL Orchestrator, the DDoS Defender, mobile safe, iApps LX, BIG-IQ and under iWorkflow orchestration engine as well as our upcoming TMOS 13.0 release all further support our efforts and enable our customers to efficiently migrate their apps to private and public cloud architectures.
As far as fiscal 2017 Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy discussed our high level financial views of fiscal 2017 and indicated that we expect to deliver revenues in the range of $510 million to $520 million in the first quarter. I believe that F5 is very well positioned moving into fiscal 2017 to take advantage of the new products and business drivers as well as the new opportunities, including the explosion of SSL encrypted traffic. Customer requirements to have consistent security policies across on-premise and public clouds and the move of application workflows to private and public cloud architectures. We will be presenting our strategy in detail at the November Analyst Investor Conference. We have a lot to cover that day, including details on our strategy and road map on several topics. For example, we will present our plans and progress on Dev Ops-centric architectures, including micro services, OpenStack, orchestration and visibility and analytics. And I look forward to seeing you at the event.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. And with that, I will now hand the call over for Q&A."

I really believe that macro was definitely involved in the U.K. issue. And one of the things that's probably unique to F5 more than a lot of other companies is that if you look at our major accounts regions, the financial vector is very, very important in that region. And frankly, that was a tough market after the Brexit announcement where they seem to be taking some time to make up their mind as to where they will deploy their money moving forward. So having said that, you always look at execution, and we continue to do that. I think it was more macro. In terms of the stand-alone product, I mean SSL, you had me talking about SSL and Orchestration and Intercept. That's -- and also DDoS, I mean they're the first 2 solutions that we come out with. We feel very, very good about the trajectory of that solution base. We're going to be talking a lot more about this in November, and you'll hear us talking about product additions in that area. I don't want to get into it now. It's not appropriate, but you'll hear us talk into that. I think it will increase the opportunity in 2017 and also more functionality as well.

GAAP net income for fiscal 2016 was $365.9 million or $5.38 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $496.2 million or $7.30 per share. And for all of fiscal 2016, cash flow from operations totaled $712 million.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '17 outlook. We are encouraged by increasing customer demand for all the new products we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016, in particular for our new family of BIG-IP appliances, the Shuttle series, which we launched in September. We expect to finish the rollout of these products in November, and we anticipate a steady ramp in sales as they replace sales of our existing appliance family over the course of this year. 
As we look to Q1, we expect to see the normal seasonality that accompanies the start of a new fiscal year. In addition, we anticipate a continued challenging sales environment within EMEA over the short term, particularly in the U.K., which we have also factored in when assessing our revenue expectations for Q1.
With that in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we are targeting revenue in a range of $510 million to $520 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expense of $285 million to $294 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.40 to $1.43 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations at or around $200 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by 60 to 80 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows. From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year with the strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 84% to 85% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing to the upper 30s range over the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions.
And finally, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 32% to 34% on a GAAP basis and 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis for the year. As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor Meeting will be November 17 in Chicago. We hope you can join us for this in-depth look at our business and our plans for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,332690128,1062465,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone.

Overall, I was very pleased with th",1437,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss the Q4 results in some detail and then outline the progress we have made during fiscal 2016 towards our goal of returning product revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q4 performance, including record revenues of $525 million, record cash from operations of $204 million and record profitability with 39% non-GAAP operating margin. 
Many of the process, systems and training investments that we made throughout the year and our go-to-market engine, together with the significant addition of new sales and marketing leadership talent, began to bear fruit in fiscal Q4. I'm especially encouraged by the improvement in sales execution last quarter from the Americas region, which returned to year-over-year sales growth for the first time in several quarters. I view this as a significant milestone on our path to delivering consistent product revenue growth. I was also happy with the results of our Japan and our Asia Pacific regions, which both delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth for the quarter and the entire fiscal year. 
Sales bookings in EMEA, however, were again down year-over-year, driven by weak sales in the U.K. Once again, our Services business delivered strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 12%. As well as providing world class customer satisfaction, our service business has been crucial to our profitability throughout fiscal 2016.
We believe that several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with enterprise and service provider customers in Q4. Firstly, customers are increasingly leveraging our products, not only for native security features but also for the ability of our products to orchestrate and intercept SSL traffic rules. Hackers today are more often leveraging SSL traffic for malware delivery thereby making the F5 SSL orchestration and inspection capabilities more and more relevant. For example, a $5 billion health care organization deployed F5's iHealth application and in so doing determined that 93% of its data center traffic was encrypted and that its existing perimeter firewalls were being defeated by a flood of malicious and nonmalicious traffic. The ultimate resolution included deploying an F5 VE-based SSL solution, working in tandem with the Cisco FirePOWER intrusion prevention offering. This collaborative SSL filtration solution was repeated more than a dozen times this quarter in several large global enterprises.
Similarly, we experienced real traction with our anti-fraud WebSafe platforms in Q4. We believe this reflects both the increasing sophistication of bad actors focused on credential theft as well as the explosion of SSL traffic in the transport of the email and other enterprise and public messaging applications. Our WebSafe product is very effective over SSL encrypted traffic, giving F5 very strong competitive differentiation with these solutions. We had a large win in Q4 with an Australian bank who leveraged our WebSafe and MobileSafe anti-fraud capabilities to facilitate the protection of 10 million domestic and international banking customers. The F5 solution provides a clientless private cloud capability to the bank, which uniquely met the requirements of their ever-growing mobile banking clientele. 
Our second emerging trend is the growth opportunity we are experiencing with customers provisioning our proxy-based security solutions to deploy a consistent security stack and security policies across on-premise, off-premise and public cloud infrastructure such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. A multinational airline was suffering from brute force attacks against its web-based and private cloud assets. This customer leveraged a combination of our ASM WAF and Silverline WAF as a service offerings to mitigate unwanted package stores and help them meet end customer service delivery expectations. This solution provided a set of IT administration abilities across its hybrid, public and private cloud environments thus reducing management complexity and total cost of ownership.
Similarly, 2 different banks in Asia Pacific [indiscernible] deployed BIG-IP ASM modules within the AWS environment to facilitate a public cloud migration of several customer-facing Internet banking sites. Our solution allowed both banks to duplicate both their ASM functionality and their homebuilt library of iRules that they had optimized in their own-premise data center for use in the public cloud. As we gain more and more experience of customers using F5 solutions to move their apps and workloads to public and private cloud architectures, we are convinced that this is yet a third market trend with significant opportunities for F5. Within our existing customers -- I'm sorry, when our existing customers initiate lift and shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view rich F5 ADC functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. For example, an international provider of SaaS-based workforce automation solutions leveraged our virtualization traffic management capabilities in AWS environment to activate remote instances of the product in Canada, Australia and the United kingdom. Working together, AWS and F5 helped the customer emulate the traffic management protocol and reuse the on-premise configuration details they had optimized and harden over time. The resulting solution greatly reduced the latency that the international customers have been experiencing when accessing the application remotely. This trend was further reinforced when our U.S.-based provider of entertainment media and streaming content deployed our ADC solution in the Amazon Web Services environment. Our cloud-based solution allow for rapid activation of additional streaming sessions during on-demand style broadcast when subscriber demand significantly exceeded expectations. The contents of these events is primarily delivered by the customers private cloud. However, this joint F5 and AWS solution provided for a standby capacity leveraging a hybrid cloud architecture.
From a product perspective, we delivered on our goal to commence shipments of a new range of appliances in Q4. This new product lineup, known internally as the Shuttle series, is perhaps the most comprehensive range of new products we have delivered to the market. We started shipping the high-end products in the final weeks of the quarter, and we expect to have the entire product range available by the end of November. As I have mentioned before, the Shuttle series is more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the Shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The Shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organization demand together with the scale, security, investment protection that's our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
In our quarterly conference call last January, when we announced our Q1 results, I gave a high-level view of the significant array of new products we had in our road map for delivery in fiscal 2016. The Shuttle series capped a tremendous suite of product introductions in fiscal 2016, which will provide solid business drivers in the current fiscal year, enabling the F5 team to achieve our goal of delivering product revenue growth throughout the year. We saw a very good traction in sales of our new 100-gig blade last quarter, and it was exciting to see a significant number of these sales taking advantage of the 100-gig blade's world-class performance to enhance solutions like the Gi firewall. Security, Gi line consolidation, NFV solutions, traffic steering and TCP optimization continue to be successfully the focus for F5 in the service provider market. 
Our vast array of new products, including the Shuttle series, the SSL Orchestrator, the DDoS Defender, MobileSafe, iApps LX, BIG-IQ and iWorkflow orchestration engine as well as our upcoming TMOS 13.0 release, all further support our efforts to enable our customers to efficiently migrate their apps to private and public cloud architectures.
As far as fiscal 2017 Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy discussed our high-level financial views of fiscal 2017 and indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $510 million to $520 million in the first quarter. I believe that F5 is very well positioned moving into fiscal 2017 to take advantage of the new products and business drivers as well as the new opportunities, including the explosion of SSL encrypted traffic. Customers requirements to have consistent security policies across on-premise and public clouds and the move of application workloads to private and public cloud architectures. We will be presenting our strategy in detail at the November Analyst Investor Conference. We have a lot to cover that day, including details on our strategy and road map on several topics. For example, we will present our plans and progress on Dev Ops-centric architectures, including containerized microservices, OpenStack, orchestration and visibility and analytics. And I look forward to seeing you at the event.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. And with that, I will now hand the call over for Q&A."

First of all, we've had strong management in EMEA for a long time, and they actually had an excellent fiscal 2015. But definitely, 2016 was probably problematic in some areas. I really believe that macro was definitely involved in the U.K. issue. And one of the things that's probably unique to F5 more than a lot of other companies is that if you look at our major accounts regions, the financial vector is very, very important in that region. And frankly, that was a tough market after the Brexit announcement where they seem to be taking some time to make up their mind as to whether they are going to deploy their money moving forward. So having said that, you always look at execution, and we continue to do that. I think it was more macro. In terms of the stand-alone product, I mean SSL, you heard me talking about SSL and orchestration and intercept. That's -- and also DDoS, I mean they're the first 2 solutions that we come out with. We feel very, very good about the trajectory of that solution base. We're going to be talking a lot more about this in November, and you'll hear us talking about product additions in that area. I don't want to get into it now. It's not appropriate, but you'll hear us talking about that. I think it will increase the opportunity in 2017 and also more functionality as well. But we think because of our SSL expertise, we are really, really well positioned to take up the opportunity. Ryan, do you want to mention anything about service chaining and how's that a unique capability for us?"

It's also not just a smaller footprint, but it's faster boot times. It's easier licensing. It's more service level APIs for programmability and orchestration. So in general, getting lighter, faster is definitely part of it, but fitting into these new orchestration environments and increasing capacity and density is also critical. So it's a big focus area."

And then as the classic lift and shift capability that we've seen where we've seen a very, very, very almost 100% success rate where customers lift and shift customers, lift and shift solutions or apps and move them over, but they want to use security products, they want to use iRules. And again, we think that's a big opportunity and we're going to be partnering with Azure and AWS for those types of opportunities. And I'm not going to be specific numbers.

When we see VE-type solutions, we tend to see as much revenue because it's not a vertical scalability as far as [indiscernible] was instead of VIPRION sitting in front of 100 apps, you have one app, one image per -- VE per app. So it's quite a complicated scenario.

F5 closed fiscal 2016 with a strong finish. Both revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 came in above our guidance as a result of solid year-over-year sales growth in the Americas, APAC and Japan and healthy demand for our existing products ahead of our appliance refresh that began rolling out in mid-September.
Revenue of $525.3 million was up 6% from the prior quarter and 5% year-over-year and above our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. GAAP EPS was $1.64 per share, above our guidance of $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.11 also exceeded our guidance of $1.92 to $1.95 per share. Q4 product revenue of $253 million, up 9% from Q3 and down 2% from Q4 of last year, represented 48% of revenue. Service revenue of $272.4 million increased 3% sequentially, 12% year-over-year and accounted for 52% of revenue. On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 4% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, increased 1% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue was up 13% from 1 year ago. 
During the quarter, enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 18%, including 10% from U.S. federal.
In Q4, we had 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.2%; and Avnet at 12.5%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $277.8 million were at the low end of our $276 million to $285 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $242.7 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.9%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.16 billion at year-end. DSO was 46 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.6 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $34.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $870.2 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.31 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. And in Q4, we increased our headcount by 70 employees to 4,395. 
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2016 was just under $2 billion, up 4% from fiscal 2015. Product revenue of $944.5 million was down 5% from the prior year and accounted for 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $1.05 billion grew 13% during the year and represented 53% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2016 was $365.9 million or $5.38 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $496.2 million or $7.30 per share. And for all of fiscal 2016, cash flow from operations totaled $712 million.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '17 outlook. We are encouraged by increasing customer demand for all the new products we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016, in particular for our new family of BIG-IP appliances, the Shuttle series, which we launched in September. We expect to finish the rollout of these products in November, and we anticipate a steady ramp in sales as they replace sales of our existing appliance family over the course of this year. 
As we look to Q1, we expect to see the normal seasonality that accompanies the start of a new fiscal year. In addition, we anticipate a continued challenging sales environment within EMEA over the short term, particularly in the U.K., which we have also factored in when assessing our revenue expectations for Q1.
With that in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we are targeting revenue in a range of $510 million to $520 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expense of $285 million to $294 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.40 to $1.43 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations at or around $200 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by 60 to 80 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows. From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 84% to 85% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing to the upper 30s range over the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions.
And finally, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 32% to 34% on a GAAP basis and 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis for the year. As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor Meeting will be November 17 in Chicago. We hope you can join us for this in-depth look at our business and our plans for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,332690128,1062515,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone.

Overall, I was very pleased with th",1443,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss the Q4 results in some detail and then outline the progress we have made during fiscal 2016 towards our goal of returning product revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q4 performance, including record revenues of $525 million, record cash from operations of $204 million and record profitability with 39% non-GAAP operating margin. 
Many of the process, systems and training investments that we made throughout the year in our go-to-market engine, together with the significant addition of new sales and marketing leadership talent, began to bear fruit in fiscal Q4. I'm especially encouraged by the improvement in sales execution last quarter from the Americas region, which returned to year-over-year sales growth for the first time in several quarters. I view this as a significant milestone on our path to delivering consistent product revenue growth. I was also happy with the results of our Japan and our Asia Pacific regions, which both delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth for the quarter and the entire fiscal year. 
Sales bookings in EMEA, however, were again down year-over-year, driven by weak sales in the U.K. Once again, our Services business delivered strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 12%. As well as providing world class customer satisfaction, our service business has been crucial to our profitability throughout fiscal 2016.
We believe there are several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with enterprise and service provider customers in Q4. Firstly, customers are increasingly leveraging our products, not only for native security features but also for the ability of our products to orchestrate and intercept SSL traffic laws. Hackers today are more often leveraging SSL traffic for malware delivery thereby making the F5 SSL orchestration and inspection capabilities more and more relevant. For example, a $5 billion health care organization deployed F5's iHealth application and in so doing determined that 93% of its data center traffic was encrypted and that its existing perimeter firewalls were being defeated by a flood of malicious and nonmalicious traffic. The ultimate resolution included deploying an F5 VE-based SSL solution, working in tandem with the Cisco FirePOWER intrusion prevention offering. This collaborative SSL orchestration solution was repeated more than a dozen times this quarter in several large global enterprises.
Similarly, we experienced real traction with our anti-fraud WebSafe platforms in Q4. We believe this reflects both the increasing sophistication of bad actors focused on credential theft as well as the explosion of SSL traffic in the transport of the email and other enterprise and public messaging applications. Our WebSafe product is very effective over SSL encrypted traffic, giving F5 very strong competitive differentiation with these solutions. We had a large win in Q4 with an Australian bank who leveraged our WebSafe and MobileSafe anti-fraud capabilities to facilitate the protection of 10 million domestic and international banking customers. The F5 solution provides a clientless private cloud capability to the bank, which uniquely met the requirements of their ever-growing mobile banking clientele. 
A second emerging trend is the growth opportunity we are experiencing with customers provisioning our proxy-based security solutions to deploy a consistent security stack and security policies across on-premise, off-premise and public cloud infrastructure such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. A multinational airline was suffering from brute force attacks against its web-based and private cloud assets. This customer leveraged a combination of our ASM WAF and Silverline WAF as a service offerings to mitigate unwanted package stores  [ph] and help them meet end customer service delivery expectations. This solution provided a set of IT administration abilities across its hybrid, public and private cloud environments, thus reducing management complexity and total cost of ownership.
Similarly, 2 different banks in our Asia Pacific theater deployed BIG-IP ASM modules within the AWS environment to facilitate a public cloud migration of several customer-facing Internet banking sites. Our solution allowed both banks to duplicate both their ASM functionality and their homebuilt library of iRules that they had optimized in their on-premise data center for use in the public cloud. As we gain more and more experience of customers using F5 solutions to move their apps and workloads to public and private cloud architectures, we are convinced that this is yet a third market trend with significant opportunities for F5. Within our existing customers -- I'm sorry, when our existing customers initiate lift and shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view rich F5 ADC functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. For example, an international provider of SaaS-based workforce automation solutions leveraged our virtualization traffic management capabilities in AWS environment to activate remote instances of the product in Canada, Australia and the United kingdom. Working together, AWS and F5 helped the customer emulate the traffic management protocol and reuse the on-premise configuration details they had optimized and hardened over time. The resulting solution greatly reduced the latency that the international customers had been experiencing when accessing the application remotely. This trend was further reinforced when a U.S.-based provider of entertainment media and streaming content deployed our ADC solution in the Amazon Web Services environment. Our cloud-based solution allow for rapid activation of additional streaming sessions during on-demand style broadcast when subscriber demand significantly exceeded expectations. The contents of these events is primarily delivered by the customer's private cloud. However, this joint F5 and AWS solution provided for a standby capacity leveraging a hybrid cloud architecture.
From a product perspective, we delivered on our goal to commence shipments of a new range of appliances in Q4. This new product lineup, known internally as the Shuttle series, is perhaps the most comprehensive range of new products we have delivered to the market. We started shipping the high-end products in the final weeks of the quarter, and we expect to have the entire product range available by the end of November. As I have mentioned before, the Shuttle series is more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the Shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The Shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organizations demand, together with the scale, security, and investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
In our quarterly conference call last January, when we announced our Q1 results, I gave a high-level view of the significant array of new products we had in our road map for delivery in fiscal 2016. The Shuttle series capped a tremendous suite of product introductions in fiscal 2016, which will provide solid business drivers in the current fiscal year, enabling the F5 team to achieve our goal of delivering product revenue growth throughout the year. We saw a very good traction in sales of our new 100-gig blade last quarter, and it was exciting to see a significant number of these sales taking advantage of the 100-gig blade's world-class performance to enhance solutions like the Gi firewall. Security, Gi line consolidation, NFV solutions, traffic steering and TCP optimization continue to be successful areas of focus for F5 in the service provider market. 
Our vast array of new products, including the Shuttle series, the SSL Orchestrator, the DDoS Defender, MobileSafe, iApps LX, BIG-IQ and our iWorkflow orchestration engine, as well as our upcoming TMOS 13.0 release, all further support our efforts to enable our customers to efficiently migrate their apps to private and public cloud architectures.
As far as fiscal 2017 Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy discussed our high-level financial views of fiscal 2017 and indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $510 million to $520 million in the first quarter. I believe that F5 is very well positioned, moving into fiscal 2017, to take advantage of the new products and business drivers as well as the new opportunities, including the explosion of SSL encrypted traffic, customers requirements to have consistent security policies across on-premise and public clouds and the move of application workloads to private and public cloud architectures. We will be presenting our strategy in detail at the November Analyst Investor Conference. We have a lot to cover that day, including details on our strategy and road map on several topics. For example, we will present our plans and progress on Dev Ops-centric architectures, including containerized microservices, OpenStack, orchestration and visibility and analytics. And I look forward to seeing you at the event.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. And with that, I will now hand the call over for Q&A."

First of all, we've had strong management in EMEA for a long time, and they actually had an excellent fiscal 2015. But definitely, 2016 was problematic in some areas. I really believe that macro was definitely involved in the U.K. issue. And one of the things that's probably unique to F5 more than a lot of other companies is that if you look at our major accounts regions, the financial vector is very, very important in that region. And frankly, that was a tough market after the Brexit announcement where they seem to be taking some time to make up their mind as to whether they are going to deploy their money moving forward. So having said that, you always look at execution, and we continue to do that, but I think it was more macro.

That's a pretty broad question in terms of the different areas because the answer is going to be all of the above in lot of the questions you talked about. First of all, I mean, when we talked about the 3 emerging things are happening that we feel excited about, one obviously being SSL, but the other 2 are very related to the cloud with one being -- we're seeing customers have this absolute need to have these constant security policies and processes throughout a hybrid cloud or public cloud or private and on-premise environment, and that's a big opportunity for us. And then as the classic lift and shift capability that we've seen where we've seen a very, very, very almost 100% success rate where customers lift and shift -- customers lift and shift solutions or apps and move them over, but they want to use security products, they want to use iRules. And again, we think that's a big opportunity and we're going to be partnering with Azure and AWS for those types of opportunities. And I'm not going to be specific on numbers. We've also seen examples where, for example, our WAF that we put with on the Azure and cloud gets like a complete new business opportunity where we did not meet customer at all. So we've seen that as well. I think that's covering most of what you asked. That was a pretty broad question. But generally, we feel quite good now that this whole move, this trend is an opportunity for us because of richness of our software and our security portfolio and our application optimization portfolio."

There's just a lot of good reasons for it to be successful. I mean the customer base, as you asked about, more than 5 years is over 40,000 and I guess about 42,500 -- 44,000, I should say, and that's bigger than it's ever been in the product refresh before.

So for example, if a customer may move applications that don't have an ADC in front of them, that's an opportunity for us. A customer, when he moves applications to a public cloud, may want to do more horizontal scaling because it's a software type shift, and that's an opportunity. In fact, we talked about that before. When we see VE-type solutions, we tend to see as much revenue because it's not a vertical scalability, it's horizontal. In other words instead of a VIPRION sitting in front of 100 apps, you have one app, one image per -- VE per app. So it's quite a complicated scenario. But we feel good about it.

F5 closed fiscal 2016 with a strong finish. Both revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 came in above our guidance as a result of solid year-over-year sales growth in the Americas, APAC and Japan and healthy demand for our existing products ahead of our appliance refresh that began rolling out in mid-September.
Revenue of $525.3 million was up 6% from the prior quarter and 5% year-over-year and above our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. GAAP EPS was $1.64 per share, above our guidance of $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.11 also exceeded our guidance of $1.92 to $1.95 per share. Q4 product revenue of $253 million, up 9% from Q3 and down 2% from Q4 of last year, represented 48% of revenue. Service revenue of $272.4 million increased 3% sequentially, 12% year-over-year and accounted for 52% of revenue. On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 4% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, increased 1% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue was up 13% from 1 year ago. 
During the quarter, enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 18%, including 10% from U.S. federal.
In Q4, we had 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.2%; and Avnet at 12.5%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $277.8 million were at the low end of our $276 million to $285 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $242.7 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.9%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.16 billion at year-end. DSO was 46 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.6 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $34.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $870.2 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.31 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. And in Q4, we increased our headcount by 70 employees to 4,395. 
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2016 was just under $2 billion, up 4% from fiscal 2015. Product revenue of $944.5 million was down 5% from the prior year and accounted for 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $1.05 billion grew 13% during the year and represented 53% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2016 was $365.9 million or $5.38 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $496.2 million or $7.30 per share. And for all of fiscal 2016, cash flow from operations totaled $712 million.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '17 outlook. We are encouraged by increasing customer demand for all the new products we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016, in particular for our new family of BIG-IP appliances, the Shuttle series, which we launched in September. We expect to finish the rollout of these products in November, and we anticipate a steady ramp in sales as they replace sales of our existing appliance family over the course of this year. 
As we look to Q1, we expect to see the normal seasonality that accompanies the start of a new fiscal year. In addition, we anticipate a continued challenging sales environment within EMEA over the short term, particularly in the U.K., which we have also factored in when assessing our revenue expectations for Q1.
With that in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we are targeting revenue in a range of $510 million to $520 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expense of $285 million to $294 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.40 to $1.43 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations at or around $200 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by 60 to 80 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows. From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 84% to 85% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing to the upper 30s range over the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions.
And finally, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 32% to 34% on a GAAP basis and 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis for the year. As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor Meeting will be November 17 in Chicago. We hope you can join us for this in-depth look at our business and our plans for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,332690128,1063048,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone.

Overall, I was very pleased with th",1443,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss the Q4 results in some detail and then outline the progress we have made during fiscal 2016 towards our goal of returning product revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q4 performance, including record revenues of $525 million, record cash from operations of $204 million and record profitability with 39% non-GAAP operating margin. 
Many of the process, systems and training investments that we made throughout the year in our go-to-market engine, together with the significant addition of new sales and marketing leadership talent, began to bear fruit in fiscal Q4. I'm especially encouraged by the improvement in sales execution last quarter from the Americas region, which returned to year-over-year sales growth for the first time in several quarters. I view this as a significant milestone on our path to delivering consistent product revenue growth. I was also happy with the results of our Japan and our Asia Pacific regions, which both delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth for the quarter and the entire fiscal year. 
Sales bookings in EMEA, however, were again down year-over-year, driven by weak sales in the U.K. Once again, our Services business delivered strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 12%. As well as providing world class customer satisfaction, our service business has been crucial to our profitability throughout fiscal 2016.
We believe there are several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with enterprise and service provider customers in Q4. Firstly, customers are increasingly leveraging our products, not only for native security features but also for the ability of our products to orchestrate and intercept SSL traffic laws. Hackers today are more often leveraging SSL traffic for malware delivery thereby making the F5 SSL orchestration and inspection capabilities more and more relevant. For example, a $5 billion health care organization deployed F5's iHealth application and in so doing determined that 93% of its data center traffic was encrypted and that its existing perimeter firewalls were being defeated by a flood of malicious and nonmalicious traffic. The ultimate resolution included deploying an F5 VE-based SSL solution, working in tandem with the Cisco FirePOWER intrusion prevention offering. This collaborative SSL orchestration solution was repeated more than a dozen times this quarter in several large global enterprises.
Similarly, we experienced real traction with our anti-fraud WebSafe platforms in Q4. We believe this reflects both the increasing sophistication of bad actors focused on credential theft as well as the explosion of SSL traffic in the transport of the email and other enterprise and public messaging applications. Our WebSafe product is very effective over SSL encrypted traffic, giving F5 very strong competitive differentiation with these solutions. We had a large win in Q4 with an Australian bank who leveraged our WebSafe and MobileSafe anti-fraud capabilities to facilitate the protection of 10 million domestic and international banking customers. The F5 solution provides a clientless private cloud capability to the bank, which uniquely met the requirements of their ever-growing mobile banking clientele. 
A second emerging trend is the growth opportunity we are experiencing with customers provisioning our proxy-based security solutions to deploy a consistent security stack and security policies across on-premise, off-premise and public cloud infrastructure such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. A multinational airline was suffering from brute force attacks against its web-based and private cloud assets. This customer leveraged a combination of our ASM WAF and Silverline WAF as a service offerings to mitigate unwanted package stores  [ph] and help them meet end customer service delivery expectations. This solution provided a set of IT administration abilities across its hybrid, public and private cloud environments, thus reducing management complexity and total cost of ownership.
Similarly, 2 different banks in our Asia Pacific theater deployed BIG-IP ASM modules within the AWS environment to facilitate a public cloud migration of several customer-facing Internet banking sites. Our solution allowed both banks to duplicate both their ASM functionality and their homebuilt library of iRules that they had optimized in their on-premise data center for use in the public cloud. As we gain more and more experience of customers using F5 solutions to move their apps and workloads to public and private cloud architectures, we are convinced that this is yet a third market trend with significant opportunities for F5. Within our existing customers -- I'm sorry, when our existing customers initiate lift and shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view rich F5 ADC functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. For example, an international provider of SaaS-based workforce automation solutions leveraged our virtualization traffic management capabilities in AWS environment to activate remote instances of the product in Canada, Australia and the United kingdom. Working together, AWS and F5 helped the customer emulate the traffic management protocol and reuse the on-premise configuration details they had optimized and hardened over time. The resulting solution greatly reduced the latency that the international customers had been experiencing when accessing the application remotely. This trend was further reinforced when a U.S.-based provider of entertainment media and streaming content deployed our ADC solution in the Amazon Web Services environment. Our cloud-based solution allow for rapid activation of additional streaming sessions during on-demand style broadcast when subscriber demand significantly exceeded expectations. The contents of these events is primarily delivered by the customer's private cloud. However, this joint F5 and AWS solution provided for a standby capacity leveraging a hybrid cloud architecture.
From a product perspective, we delivered on our goal to commence shipments of a new range of appliances in Q4. This new product lineup, known internally as the Shuttle series, is perhaps the most comprehensive range of new products we have delivered to the market. We started shipping the high-end products in the final weeks of the quarter, and we expect to have the entire product range available by the end of November. As I have mentioned before, the Shuttle series is more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the Shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The Shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organizations demand, together with the scale, security, and investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
In our quarterly conference call last January, when we announced our Q1 results, I gave a high-level view of the significant array of new products we had in our road map for delivery in fiscal 2016. The Shuttle series capped a tremendous suite of product introductions in fiscal 2016, which will provide solid business drivers in the current fiscal year, enabling the F5 team to achieve our goal of delivering product revenue growth throughout the year. We saw a very good traction in sales of our new 100-gig blade last quarter, and it was exciting to see a significant number of these sales taking advantage of the 100-gig blade's world-class performance to enhance solutions like the Gi firewall. Security, Gi line consolidation, NFV solutions, traffic steering and TCP optimization continue to be successful areas of focus for F5 in the service provider market. 
Our vast array of new products, including the Shuttle series, the SSL Orchestrator, the DDoS Defender, MobileSafe, iApps LX, BIG-IQ and our iWorkflow orchestration engine, as well as our upcoming TMOS 13.0 release, all further support our efforts to enable our customers to efficiently migrate their apps to private and public cloud architectures.
As far as fiscal 2017 Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy discussed our high-level financial views of fiscal 2017 and indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $510 million to $520 million in the first quarter. I believe that F5 is very well positioned, moving into fiscal 2017, to take advantage of the new products and business drivers as well as the new opportunities, including the explosion of SSL encrypted traffic, customers requirements to have consistent security policies across on-premise and public clouds and the move of application workloads to private and public cloud architectures. We will be presenting our strategy in detail at the November Analyst Investor Conference. We have a lot to cover that day, including details on our strategy and road map on several topics. For example, we will present our plans and progress on Dev Ops-centric architectures, including containerized microservices, OpenStack, orchestration and visibility and analytics. And I look forward to seeing you at the event.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. And with that, I will now hand the call over for Q&A."

First of all, we've had strong management in EMEA for a long time, and they actually had an excellent fiscal 2015. But definitely, 2016 was problematic in some areas. I really believe that macro was definitely involved in the U.K. issue. And one of the things that's probably unique to F5 more than a lot of other companies is that if you look at our major accounts regions, the financial vector is very, very important in that region. And frankly, that was a tough market after the Brexit announcement where they seem to be taking some time to make up their mind as to whether they are going to deploy their money moving forward. So having said that, you always look at execution, and we continue to do that, but I think it was more macro. In terms of the stand-alone product, I mean SSL, you heard me talking about SSL and orchestration and intercept. That's -- and also DDoS, I mean they're the first 2 solutions that we come out with.

I don't want to get into it now. It's not appropriate, but you'll hear us talking about that. I think it will increase the opportunity in 2017 and also more functionality as well.

And then as the classic lift and shift capability that we've seen where we've seen a very, very, very almost 100% success rate where customers lift and shift -- customers lift and shift solutions or apps and move them over, but they want to use security products, they want to use iRules. And again, we think that's a big opportunity and we're going to be partnering with Azure and AWS for those types of opportunities. And I'm not going to be specific on numbers. We've also seen examples where, for example, our WAF that we put with on the Azure and cloud gets like a complete new business opportunity where we did not meet customer at all.

A customer, when he moves applications to a public cloud, may want to do more horizontal scaling because it's a software type shift, and that's an opportunity. In fact, we talked about that before. When we see VE-type solutions, we tend to see as much revenue because it's not a vertical scalability, it's horizontal. In other words instead of a VIPRION sitting in front of 100 apps, you have one app, one image per -- VE per app. So it's quite a complicated scenario. But we feel good about it.

F5 closed fiscal 2016 with a strong finish. Both revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 came in above our guidance as a result of solid year-over-year sales growth in the Americas, APAC and Japan and healthy demand for our existing products ahead of our appliance refresh that began rolling out in mid-September.
Revenue of $525.3 million was up 6% from the prior quarter and 5% year-over-year and above our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. GAAP EPS was $1.64 per share, above our guidance of $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.11 also exceeded our guidance of $1.92 to $1.95 per share. Q4 product revenue of $253 million, up 9% from Q3 and down 2% from Q4 of last year, represented 48% of revenue. Service revenue of $272.4 million increased 3% sequentially, 12% year-over-year and accounted for 52% of revenue. On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 4% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, increased 1% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue was up 13% from 1 year ago. 
During the quarter, enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 18%, including 10% from U.S. federal.
In Q4, we had 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.2%; and Avnet at 12.5%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $277.8 million were at the low end of our $276 million to $285 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $242.7 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.9%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.16 billion at year-end. DSO was 46 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.6 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $34.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $870.2 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.31 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. And in Q4, we increased our headcount by 70 employees to 4,395. 
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2016 was just under $2 billion, up 4% from fiscal 2015. Product revenue of $944.5 million was down 5% from the prior year and accounted for 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $1.05 billion grew 13% during the year and represented 53% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2016 was $365.9 million or $5.38 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $496.2 million or $7.30 per share. And for all of fiscal 2016, cash flow from operations totaled $712 million.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '17 outlook. We are encouraged by increasing customer demand for all the new products we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016, in particular for our new family of BIG-IP appliances, the Shuttle series, which we launched in September. We expect to finish the rollout of these products in November, and we anticipate a steady ramp in sales as they replace sales of our existing appliance family over the course of this year. 
As we look to Q1, we expect to see the normal seasonality that accompanies the start of a new fiscal year. In addition, we anticipate a continued challenging sales environment within EMEA over the short term, particularly in the U.K., which we have also factored in when assessing our revenue expectations for Q1.
With that in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we are targeting revenue in a range of $510 million to $520 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expense of $285 million to $294 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.40 to $1.43 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations at or around $200 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by 60 to 80 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows. From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 84% to 85% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing to the upper 30s range over the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions.
And finally, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 32% to 34% on a GAAP basis and 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis for the year. As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor Meeting will be November 17 in Chicago. We hope you can join us for this in-depth look at our business and our plans for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,332690128,2474235,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone.

Overall, I was very pleased with th",1443,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss the Q4 results in some detail and then outline the progress we have made during fiscal 2016 towards our goal of returning product revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q4 performance, including record revenues of $525 million, record cash from operations of $204 million and record profitability with 39% non-GAAP operating margin. 
Many of the process, systems and training investments that we made throughout the year in our go-to-market engine, together with the significant addition of new sales and marketing leadership talent, began to bear fruit in fiscal Q4. I'm especially encouraged by the improvement in sales execution last quarter from the Americas region, which returned to year-over-year sales growth for the first time in several quarters. I view this as a significant milestone on our path to delivering consistent product revenue growth. I was also happy with the results of our Japan and our Asia Pacific regions, which both delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth for the quarter and the entire fiscal year. 
Sales bookings in EMEA, however, were again down year-over-year, driven by weak sales in the U.K. Once again, our Services business delivered strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 12%. As well as providing world class customer satisfaction, our service business has been crucial to our profitability throughout fiscal 2016.
We believe there are several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with enterprise and service provider customers in Q4. Firstly, customers are increasingly leveraging our products, not only for native security features but also for the ability of our products to orchestrate and intercept SSL traffic laws. Hackers today are more often leveraging SSL traffic for malware delivery thereby making the F5 SSL orchestration and inspection capabilities more and more relevant. For example, a $5 billion health care organization deployed F5's iHealth application and in so doing determined that 93% of its data center traffic was encrypted and that its existing perimeter firewalls were being defeated by a flood of malicious and nonmalicious traffic. The ultimate resolution included deploying an F5 VE-based SSL solution, working in tandem with the Cisco FirePOWER intrusion prevention offering. This collaborative SSL orchestration solution was repeated more than a dozen times this quarter in several large global enterprises.
Similarly, we experienced real traction with our anti-fraud WebSafe platforms in Q4. We believe this reflects both the increasing sophistication of bad actors focused on credential theft as well as the explosion of SSL traffic in the transport of the email and other enterprise and public messaging applications. Our WebSafe product is very effective over SSL encrypted traffic, giving F5 very strong competitive differentiation with these solutions. We had a large win in Q4 with an Australian bank who leveraged our WebSafe and MobileSafe anti-fraud capabilities to facilitate the protection of 10 million domestic and international banking customers. The F5 solution provides a clientless private cloud capability to the bank, which uniquely met the requirements of their ever-growing mobile banking clientele. 
A second emerging trend is the growth opportunity we are experiencing with customers provisioning our proxy-based security solutions to deploy a consistent security stack and security policies across on-premise, off-premise and public cloud infrastructure such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. A multinational airline was suffering from brute force attacks against its web-based and private cloud assets. This customer leveraged a combination of our ASM WAF and Silverline WAF as a service offerings to mitigate unwanted package stores  [ph] and help them meet end customer service delivery expectations. This solution provided a set of IT administration abilities across its hybrid, public and private cloud environments, thus reducing management complexity and total cost of ownership.
Similarly, 2 different banks in our Asia Pacific theater deployed BIG-IP ASM modules within the AWS environment to facilitate a public cloud migration of several customer-facing Internet banking sites. Our solution allowed both banks to duplicate both their ASM functionality and their homebuilt library of iRules that they had optimized in their on-premise data center for use in the public cloud. As we gain more and more experience of customers using F5 solutions to move their apps and workloads to public and private cloud architectures, we are convinced that this is yet a third market trend with significant opportunities for F5. Within our existing customers -- I'm sorry, when our existing customers initiate lift and shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view rich F5 ADC functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. For example, an international provider of SaaS-based workforce automation solutions leveraged our virtualization traffic management capabilities in AWS environment to activate remote instances of the product in Canada, Australia and the United kingdom. Working together, AWS and F5 helped the customer emulate the traffic management protocol and reuse the on-premise configuration details they had optimized and hardened over time. The resulting solution greatly reduced the latency that the international customers had been experiencing when accessing the application remotely. This trend was further reinforced when a U.S.-based provider of entertainment media and streaming content deployed our ADC solution in the Amazon Web Services environment. Our cloud-based solution allow for rapid activation of additional streaming sessions during on-demand style broadcast when subscriber demand significantly exceeded expectations. The contents of these events is primarily delivered by the customer's private cloud. However, this joint F5 and AWS solution provided for a standby capacity leveraging a hybrid cloud architecture.
From a product perspective, we delivered on our goal to commence shipments of a new range of appliances in Q4. This new product lineup, known internally as the Shuttle series, is perhaps the most comprehensive range of new products we have delivered to the market. We started shipping the high-end products in the final weeks of the quarter, and we expect to have the entire product range available by the end of November. As I have mentioned before, the Shuttle series is more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the Shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The Shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organizations demand, together with the scale, security, and investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
In our quarterly conference call last January, when we announced our Q1 results, I gave a high-level view of the significant array of new products we had in our road map for delivery in fiscal 2016. The Shuttle series capped a tremendous suite of product introductions in fiscal 2016, which will provide solid business drivers in the current fiscal year, enabling the F5 team to achieve our goal of delivering product revenue growth throughout the year. We saw a very good traction in sales of our new 100-gig blade last quarter, and it was exciting to see a significant number of these sales taking advantage of the 100-gig blade's world-class performance to enhance solutions like the Gi firewall. Security, Gi line consolidation, NFV solutions, traffic steering and TCP optimization continue to be successful areas of focus for F5 in the service provider market. 
Our vast array of new products, including the Shuttle series, the SSL Orchestrator, the DDoS Defender, MobileSafe, iApps LX, BIG-IQ and our iWorkflow orchestration engine, as well as our upcoming TMOS 13.0 release, all further support our efforts to enable our customers to efficiently migrate their apps to private and public cloud architectures.
As far as fiscal 2017 Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy discussed our high-level financial views of fiscal 2017 and indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $510 million to $520 million in the first quarter. I believe that F5 is very well positioned, moving into fiscal 2017, to take advantage of the new products and business drivers as well as the new opportunities, including the explosion of SSL encrypted traffic, customers requirements to have consistent security policies across on-premise and public clouds and the move of application workloads to private and public cloud architectures. We will be presenting our strategy in detail at the November Analyst Investor Conference. We have a lot to cover that day, including details on our strategy and road map on several topics. For example, we will present our plans and progress on Dev Ops-centric architectures, including containerized microservices, OpenStack, orchestration and visibility and analytics. And I look forward to seeing you at the event.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. And with that, I will now hand the call over for Q&A."

I really believe that macro was definitely involved in the U.K. issue. And one of the things that's probably unique to F5 more than a lot of other companies is that if you look at our major accounts regions, the financial vector is very, very important in that region. And frankly, that was a tough market after the Brexit announcement where they seem to be taking some time to make up their mind as to whether they are going to deploy their money moving forward. So having said that, you always look at execution, and we continue to do that, but I think it was more macro. In terms of the stand-alone product, I mean SSL, you heard me talking about SSL and orchestration and intercept. That's -- and also DDoS, I mean they're the first 2 solutions that we come out with.

I mean the customer base, as you asked about, more than 5 years is over 40,000 and I guess about 42,500 -- 44,000, I should say, and that's bigger than it's ever been in the product refresh before. We've got massive amount of systems available now to the sales force to highlight where these customers are, when their service contracts are up, et cetera. So they've got a lot of ammunition to be able to execute on that refresh. Was there any other questions? I think that answered the question."

We've added a whole load of new processes. But one thing you say Tal, I want to be very clear about we didn't say last quarter that we thought the cloud was a headwind. We actually talked about a lot of customer examples showing the opposite, where it was a tailwind, and what we've seen is that tailwind getting stronger in Q4."

So for example, if a customer may move applications that don't have an ADC in front of them, that's an opportunity for us. A customer, when he moves applications to a public cloud, may want to do more horizontal scaling because it's a software type shift, and that's an opportunity. In fact, we talked about that before. When we see VE-type solutions, we tend to see as much revenue because it's not a vertical scalability, it's horizontal. In other words instead of a VIPRION sitting in front of 100 apps, you have one app, one image per -- VE per app. So it's quite a complicated scenario. But we feel good about it. Everything we've seen tells us it's an opportunity. The other thing we can talk about when we do that is adding security. Security when you move to the cloud is critical. So the chance that it was adding more functionality from a module perspective is also good."

F5 closed fiscal 2016 with a strong finish. Both revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 came in above our guidance as a result of solid year-over-year sales growth in the Americas, APAC and Japan and healthy demand for our existing products ahead of our appliance refresh that began rolling out in mid-September.
Revenue of $525.3 million was up 6% from the prior quarter and 5% year-over-year and above our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. GAAP EPS was $1.64 per share, above our guidance of $1.44 to $1.47 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.11 also exceeded our guidance of $1.92 to $1.95 per share. Q4 product revenue of $253 million, up 9% from Q3 and down 2% from Q4 of last year, represented 48% of revenue. Service revenue of $272.4 million increased 3% sequentially, 12% year-over-year and accounted for 52% of revenue. On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 4% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, increased 1% year-over-year. And Japan at 4% of total revenue was up 13% from 1 year ago. 
During the quarter, enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 18%, including 10% from U.S. federal.
In Q4, we had 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.2%; and Avnet at 12.5%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $277.8 million were at the low end of our $276 million to $285 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $242.7 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.9%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.16 billion at year-end. DSO was 46 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.6 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $34.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $870.2 million. 
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.31 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. And in Q4, we increased our headcount by 70 employees to 4,395. 
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2016 was just under $2 billion, up 4% from fiscal 2015. Product revenue of $944.5 million was down 5% from the prior year and accounted for 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $1.05 billion grew 13% during the year and represented 53% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2016 was $365.9 million or $5.38 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $496.2 million or $7.30 per share. And for all of fiscal 2016, cash flow from operations totaled $712 million.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '17 outlook. We are encouraged by increasing customer demand for all the new products we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016, in particular for our new family of BIG-IP appliances, the Shuttle series, which we launched in September. We expect to finish the rollout of these products in November, and we anticipate a steady ramp in sales as they replace sales of our existing appliance family over the course of this year. 
As we look to Q1, we expect to see the normal seasonality that accompanies the start of a new fiscal year. In addition, we anticipate a continued challenging sales environment within EMEA over the short term, particularly in the U.K., which we have also factored in when assessing our revenue expectations for Q1.
With that in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we are targeting revenue in a range of $510 million to $520 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expense of $285 million to $294 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.40 to $1.43 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.92 to $1.95 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations at or around $200 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by 60 to 80 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows. From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 84% to 85% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing to the upper 30s range over the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions.
And finally, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 32% to 34% on a GAAP basis and 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis for the year. As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor Meeting will be November 17 in Chicago. We hope you can join us for this in-depth look at our business and our plans for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,332690128,2474236,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone.

Overall, I was very pleased with th",1443,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss the Q4 results in some detail and then outline the progress we have made during fiscal 2016 towards our goal of returning product revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Overall, I was very pleased with the F5 team's fiscal Q4 performance, including record revenues of $525 million, record cash from operations of $204 million and record profitability with 39% non-GAAP operating margin. 
Many of the process, systems and training investments that we made throughout the year in our go-to-market engine, together with the significant addition of new sales and marketing leadership talent, began to bear fruit in fiscal Q4. I'm especially encouraged by the improvement in sales execution last quarter from the Americas region, which returned to year-over-year sales growth for the first time in several quarters. I view this as a significant milestone on our path to delivering consistent product revenue growth. I was also happy with the results of our Japan and our Asia Pacific regions, which both delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth for the quarter and the entire fiscal year. 
Sales bookings in EMEA, however, were again down year-over-year, driven by weak sales in the U.K. Once again, our Services business delivered strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 12%. As well as providing world class customer satisfaction, our service business has been crucial to our profitability throughout fiscal 2016.
We believe there are several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with enterprise and service provider customers in Q4. Firstly, customers are increasingly leveraging our products, not only for native security features but also for the ability of our products to orchestrate and intercept SSL traffic laws. Hackers today are more often leveraging SSL traffic for malware delivery thereby making the F5 SSL orchestration and inspection capabilities more and more relevant. For example, a $5 billion health care organization deployed F5's iHealth application and in so doing determined that 93% of its data center traffic was encrypted and that its existing perimeter firewalls were being defeated by a flood of malicious and nonmalicious traffic. The ultimate resolution included deploying an F5 VE-based SSL solution, working in tandem with the Cisco FirePOWER intrusion prevention offering. This collaborative SSL orchestration solution was repeated more than a dozen times this quarter in several large global enterprises.
Similarly, we experienced real traction with our anti-fraud WebSafe platforms in Q4. We believe this reflects both the increasing sophistication of bad actors focused on credential theft as well as the explosion of SSL traffic in the transport of the email and other enterprise and public messaging applications. Our WebSafe product is very effective over SSL encrypted traffic, giving F5 very strong competitive differentiation with these solutions. We had a large win in Q4 with an Australian bank who leveraged our WebSafe and MobileSafe anti-fraud capabilities to facilitate the protection of 10 million domestic and international banking customers. The F5 solution provides a clientless private cloud capability to the bank, which uniquely met the requirements of their ever-growing mobile banking clientele. 
A second emerging trend is the growth opportunity we are experiencing with customers provisioning our proxy-based security solutions to deploy a consistent security stack and security policies across on-premise, off-premise and public cloud infrastructure such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. A multinational airline was suffering from brute force attacks against its web-based and private cloud assets. This customer leveraged a combination of our ASM WAF and Silverline WAF as a service offerings to mitigate unwanted package stores  [ph] and help them meet end customer service delivery expectations. This solution provided a set of IT administration abilities across its hybrid, public and private cloud environments, thus reducing management complexity and total cost of ownership.
Similarly, 2 different banks in our Asia Pacific theater deployed BIG-IP ASM modules within the AWS environment to facilitate a public cloud migration of several customer-facing Internet banking sites. Our solution allowed both banks to duplicate both their ASM functionality and their homebuilt library of iRules that they had optimized in their on-premise data center for use in the public cloud. As we gain more and more experience of customers using F5 solutions to move their apps and workloads to public and private cloud architectures, we are convinced that this is yet a third market trend with significant opportunities for F5. Within our existing customers -- I'm sorry, when our existing customers initiate lift and shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view rich F5 ADC functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security. For example, an international provider of SaaS-based workforce automation solutions leveraged our virtualization traffic management capabilities in AWS environment to activate remote instances of the product in Canada, Australia and the United kingdom. Working together, AWS and F5 helped the customer emulate the traffic management protocol and reuse the on-premise configuration details they had optimized and hardened over time. The resulting solution greatly reduced the latency that the international customers had been experiencing when accessing the application remotely. This trend was further reinforced when a U.S.-based provider of entertainment media and streaming content deployed our ADC solution in the Amazon Web Services environment. Our cloud-based solution allow for rapid activation of additional streaming sessions during on-demand style broadcast when subscriber demand significantly exceeded expectations. The contents of these events is primarily delivered by the customer's private cloud. However, this joint F5 and AWS solution provided for a standby capacity leveraging a hybrid cloud architecture.
From a product perspective, we delivered on our goal to commence shipments of a new range of appliances in Q4. This new product lineup, known internally as the Shuttle series, is perhaps the most comprehensive range of new products we have delivered to the market. We started shipping the high-end products in the final weeks of the quarter, and we expect to have the entire product range available by the end of November. As I have mentioned before, the Shuttle series is more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the Shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The Shuttle series provides the agility that Dev Ops organizations demand, together with the scale, security, and investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.
In our quarterly conference call last January, when we announced our Q1 results, I gave a high-level view of the significant array of new products we had in our road map for delivery in fiscal 2016. The Shuttle series capped a tremendous suite of product introductions in fiscal 2016, which will provide solid business drivers in the current fiscal year, enabling the F5 team to achieve our goal of delivering product revenue growth throughout the year. We saw a very good traction in sales of our new 100-gig blade last quarter, and it was exciting to see a significant number of these sales taking advantage of the 100-gig blade's world-class performance to enhance solutions like the Gi firewall. Security, Gi line consolidation, NFV solutions, traffic steering and TCP optimization continue to be successful areas of focus for F5 in the service provider market. 
Our vast array of new products, including the Shuttle series, the SSL Orchestrator, the DDoS Defender, MobileSafe, iApps LX, BIG-IQ and our iWorkflow orchestration engine, as well as our upcoming TMOS 13.0 release, all further support our efforts to enable our customers to efficiently migrate their apps to private and public cloud architectures.
As far as fiscal 2017 Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy discussed our high-level financial views of fiscal 2017 and indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $510 million to $520 million in the first quarter. I believe that F5 is very well positioned, moving into fiscal 2017, to take advantage of the new products and business drivers as well as the new opportunities, including the explosion of SSL encrypted traffic, customers requirements to have consistent security policies across on-premise and public clouds and the move of application workloads to private and public cloud architectures. We will be presenting our strategy in detail at the November Analyst Investor Conference. We have a lot to cover that day, including details on our strategy and road map on several topics. For example, we will present our plans and progress on Dev Ops-centric architectures, including containerized microservices, OpenStack, orchestration and visibility and analytics. And I look forward to seeing you at the event.
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. And with that, I will now hand the call over for Q&A."

First of all, we've had strong management in EMEA for a long time, and they actually had an excellent fiscal 2015. But definitely, 2016 was problematic in some areas. I really believe that macro was definitely involved in the U.K. issue. And one of the things that's probably unique to F5 more than a lot of other companies is that if you look at our major accounts regions, the financial vector is very, very important in that region. And frankly, that was a tough market after the Brexit announcement where they seem to be taking some time to make up their mind as to whether they are going to deploy their money moving forward. So having said that, you always look at execution, and we continue to do that, but I think it was more macro. In terms of the stand-alone product, I mean SSL, you heard me talking about SSL and orchestration and intercept. That's -- and also DDoS, I mean they're the first 2 solutions that we come out with.

I don't want to get into it now. It's not appropriate, but you'll hear us talking about that. I think it will increase the opportunity in 2017 and also more functionality as well.

It's also not just a smaller footprint, but it's faster boot times. It's easier licensing. It's more service level APIs for programmability and orchestration. So in general, getting lighter, faster is definitely part of it, but fitting into these new orchestration environments and increasing capacity and density is also critical.

And then as the classic lift and shift capability that we've seen where we've seen a very, very, very almost 100% success rate where customers lift and shift -- customers lift and shift solutions or apps and move them over, but they want to use security products, they want to use iRules. And again, we think that's a big opportunity and we're going to be partnering with Azure and AWS for those types of opportunities. And I'm not going to be specific on numbers. We've also seen examples where, for example, our WAF that we put with on the Azure and cloud gets like a complete new business opportunity where we did not meet customer at all.

One, we're seeing higher gross margins from our consulting business. Efficiency is just overall with technology that we're using for just higher productivity, call avoidance, those types of things. And then our hiring was a little behind, which drove it up as well. Gross margin on the product side was actually pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. So in our guidance, you see that we pulled it back a little bit, and that's because we'll probably catch up on the hiring side as we drive through Q1. And then in terms of the profile as it relates to the new product introductions, they're going to be pretty consistent. We're still in the position that we are able to price to margin and we do that in driving value, and we see that in the consistent -- consistency in the product margin we've seen for really years."

We're happy with this traction. We've seen -- remember, it's a high-end products we've announced so far and then the rest of the product line we expect to be done by the end of November. There's just a lot of good reasons for it to be successful. I mean the customer base, as you asked about, more than 5 years is over 40,000 and I guess about 42,500 -- 44,000, I should say, and that's bigger than it's ever been in the product refresh before.

So for example, if a customer may move applications that don't have an ADC in front of them, that's an opportunity for us. A customer, when he moves applications to a public cloud, may want to do more horizontal scaling because it's a software type shift, and that's an opportunity. In fact, we talked about that before. When we see VE-type solutions, we tend to see as much revenue because it's not a vertical scalability, it's horizontal. In other words instead of a VIPRION sitting in front of 100 apps, you have one app, one image per -- VE per app. So it's quite a complicated scenario. But we feel good about it. Everything we've seen tells us it's an opportunity. The other thing we can talk about when we do that is adding security. Security when you move to the cloud is critical.
