Welcome to our conference call. I'm Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business. During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. Statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. We'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided direct reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
Before we share the details about the quarter, I'd like to comment on a lot of the questions I've get asked most frequently these days, which is how the merger integration going. Pleased to report the merger integration is going extremely well. I believe, even more strongly today than strategic rationales of the merger than I did when we announced the merger 1 year ago. We have the first or second waiting positions in attractive global packaging markets and we're aggressively working to maximize the opportunities of the merger while improving operational efficiencies across our organization. We're executing on and making meaningful progress when realizing our $1 billion in synergy and performance improvement opportunities. 
is building an outstanding WestRock team that's aligned and focused on building the premier global packaging company. 
Our customers are very interested in using innovation to increase their sales and reducing their cost to increase their profitability. WestRock's suite of paper packaging and merchandising products and services across a multinational platform is enabling us to engage with customers in ways that no other company can. We're an integrated, global packaging solutions provider, and this is resonating with our customers. We're executing on our strategy and we're working well together while doing so. We're taking advantage of the opportunities to improve our business through our investment in people, assets and acquisitions. 
WestRock is a compelling value creation opportunity. We're well positioned to deliver value for stockholders. We're strong believers in managing the business to generate cash, we've aligned our strategies and to do just that. During our first 6 months of operation, we generated $609 million or $2.33 per share. And free cash flow after adding back after-tax cash, merger and integration-related restructuring costs. For this fiscal year, we expect to generate in the range of $950 million to $1 billion free cash flow, or approximately $3.75 per share based on our current share count. 
We've demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to stockholders. We've repurchased 9.5 million shares over the past 7 months and are paying in annual dividend of about $400 million. We intend to maintain our dividend after the spinoff Specialty Chemicals. At yesterday's closing stock price, our current yield of 4.7% would increase over 5% after completion of the spin. 
Let's turn to the financial results for the quarter. WestRock sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $0.59. Our last 12 months credit agreement EBITDA margin was 16.9%. These returns are largely in line with expectations. Our Corrugated Packaging business performed well, with strong growth in box sales in the United States. We've managed our supply with our customer demand, and as a result, we've permanently closed 3 mills: Coshocton, MeadWestvaco and Uncasville, with total annual capacity of 675,000 tons. 
Our Brazilian Corrugated Packaging operations continued to perform exceptionally well. This business is providing great current returns and also providing attractive investment opportunities to improve our returns over the next several years. 
We've added SP Fiber and some bale packaging businesses to our platform. We expect to complete our joint venture with Grupo Gondi during the first half of calendar year 2016. All 3 transactions add to the strength of our business. 
We've repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock since November. To date, we've bought back 9.5 million shares under our $40 million share repurchase authorization. We reassessed our valuation for Specialty Chemicals business and lack of changing market conditions and financial performance and lower comparative market valuations for their peer group. We reduced the estimated enterprise value for Specialty Chemicals business and the purchase accounting value recorded last July to approximately $1.6 billion. As a result, we've recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $478 million. 
We're making progress on of Ingevity. Earlier this month, we received a private letter internal revenue services to positively address each issue we need to have addressed for the spin, including the removal of additional limitations on WestRock stock repurchases. We anticipate completion of the spin by early May, later than previously announced due to the inherent complexities of the separation process. 
The Corrugated Packaging team delivered outstanding results across our North American box business, with box shipments up 2.9% on a per day basis. Box prices were stable sequentially. All regions of the United States did well, although we did have a slight decline in the west, principally due to a decline in produce volumes. 
We have particularly strong performance in e-commerce. We shipped 530,000 tons to domestic and export markets, including approximately 280,000 tons to domestic markets and 250,000 tons to export markets. Without SP Fiber, domestic shipments were 86,000 tons less than last year, and our prices were essentially flat sequentially. Export channels continue to be price competitive. Overall export pricing was down $9 per ton on a sequential-quarter basis. 
We actively manage our system to meet our customer demand and took 264,000 tons of economic and maintenance downtime in the quarter. The incremental cost of economic downtime was $11 million year-over-year. The closure of the Uncasville and Coshocton mills will reduce our annual operating cost by $25 million. 
The cumulative impact of these actions has balanced our containerboards system. We made solid gains in productivity with incremental contribution to pretax income of $36 million over last year. 
Brazil continued to perform very well, both individually and compared to the rest of the Brazilian market, with EBITDA margins of 24.8%. The [indiscernible] mill in our virgin fiber supply are competitive advantage in this market. WestRock's stock shipments increased 1% compared to the prior year. This is significantly more than the overall market in Brazil, which declined by 5%. 
Turning to the Consumer Packaging segment. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2% grew by 160 basis points over last year. This is driven by strong performance in our packaging businesses, overall stable consumer mill volumes, productivity gains and energy deflation. Price and mix were stable for the quarter. External SBS volumes from our mill systems were modestly down, largely related to the loss of a customer last year. 
Otherwise we're seeing good growth in premium applications including tobacco, commercial print and services cup. While the SBS market is challenged by slow demand and process food applications, we're continuing to perform well across the diversified mix of end markets that we serve. We've seen a small amount of foreign competition in more commodity portions of the market, such as food service plate and general markets. This has not have an appreciable impact on our business. 
In addition to external SBS sales, we're making good progress internalizing approximately 100,000 tons of incremental SBS production into our converting system, the opportunities identified during the merger, the recent acquisitions of packaging businesses. 
Also in the quarter, we continued the integration of more than 150,000 tons of the Carolina commercial print business that we acquired last year. This production transitioned fully to our SBS system earlier this month. The net result of the gains in internal converting in the Carolina acquisition increased the loading and production efficiencies for our SBS mill system. The combined and beverage packaging businesses delivered a good quarter, as modest growth in global beer markets offset declines in carbonated sort soft drink volumes, particularly in North America. 
Our mills operated well during the quarter, and executed and $50 per ton price increase announced less summer. With the Cenveo Packaging acquisition, we will internalize an additional 5,000 tons of into our system. 
Our folding carton converting business continues to perform well. Volumes exceeded of the overall market. Pricing was slightly down as contract renewals were competitive and some food customers experience declining volumes. had a very good quarter with strong European volumes more than offsetting some weakness in North America. Margin continues to improve with good mix, cost management and productivity. 
Merchandising display sales declined due to lower commodity activity with key customers. The core business remains attractive, and we're continuing to optimize the fixed cost structure of this business to improve profitability. 
Turning to Specialty Chemicals. The oil prices has reduced demand for oilfield chemicals and industry products. This has made competing petroleum-based chemistries more economical. 
Total sales during the quarter declined by $31 million compared to last year. Segment EBITDA of $32 million was a little more than half of last year's quarter. Segment profitability also reflected $8.5 million in outage in China start up expenses. The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for this business. 
Ingevity's annual revenue is running at more than $900 million and adjusted EBITDA is now at an annual rate of approximately $200 million. The oilfield services business is now less than 10% of annual revenue at approximately $80 million. This business is relatively smaller compared to the total business. We achieved record quarterly sales for activated carbon and asphalt additive products. We have good growth engines in the asphalt additives and carbon, including the new automotive carbon plant that's starting up in China. We have a strong profitable business, a very strong management team and the scale with which to operate as a successful public company. The long-term fundamentals of the business are sound and will make for compelling growth equity story. Post spin, Ingevity will have reasonable leverage at about 2.5x EBITDA. This will provide an immediate cash inflow of approximately $400 million to WestRock at the time of the spin, plus funding an additional $80 million of security for a capital lease retained by WestRock. 
Our land business results reflected purchase price accounting step up with the assets to fair market value as of July 1 merger closing. The step up effectively removes what the anticipated development profit was at that time. This has no effect on cash flow, only on reported earnings. 
Most important thing to know about this segment is that we're operating in Charlestown, one of the healthiest real estate markets in the country. We're looking at ways to monetize our portfolio faster than the normal development process would allow. We've already make some progress on certain projects and we expect to do more on this front. 
Over the last several months, we completed the SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging acquisitions with a total investment of approximately $400 million. with SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging are great strategic fits with our business and strategy. We believe these businesses will generate excellent returns on investment. 
We expect to complete the Grupo Gondi joint venture investment in the next couple of months. Mexico is very important to our customers and to us, due to its proximity to the United States and its strong growth profile. We have been looking for a long time for the right opportunity to grow our capabilities in Mexico, and I believe that the partnership with Grupo Gondi is the best way for WestRock to grow in Mexico. WestRock will contribute $175 million in cash and our 3 Mexican box plants, and Grupo Gondi will contribute their business. Based on current exchange rates in the last 12 months results, the joint venture on a pro forma basis has generated $670 million in sales and $135 million in EBITDA. Our box plants have generated about 10% to 15% of the $135 million. We will have a 25% interest in the joint venture, and the joint venture will have net positive cash on the balance sheet when the joint venture is formed. The cash that we're contributing will be invested by the joint venture to support growth. WestRock will continue to provide the 200,000 that we supplied to our 3 box plants and will have continuing opportunities to supply additional tons if the joint venture grows. We're currently executing on an opportunity to supply 25,000 tons of crop liner to Gondi that we were not supplying 6 months ago. We will have an opportunity to build upon our combined relationships and capabilities to grow in the attractive paper and packaging market in Mexico. Now I'll turn it over to Ward for additional details."

We reduced corporate expenses by $21 million and this is included as part of our $250 million synergy and productivity performance. Our non-service pension income i",818,"Thank you, Steve. Total non-allocated expenses were $4.5 million in the current quarter. We reduced corporate expenses by $21 million and this is included as part of our $250 million synergy and productivity performance. 
Our non-service pension income is $25 million lower than the $47 million recorded last year. This was principally a result of our pension derisking strategy, which was implemented to protect our overfunded pension plan status. We reallocated our investments to lower return asset categories, which reduced our pension income. Over U.S. qualified plants have $6.4 billion in assets. These are 108% funded and have lost very little value during the recent market disruptions. Our de-risking strategy made a lot of sense last summer and even more now. We are one of the few U.S. companies and the only one of our peers with an overfunded pension plan and we are careful to protect that value. 
We have a very disciplined approach to realizing our synergies and performance improvements across our businesses and functions. We are executing on the opportunities and projects to reach our $1 billion goal and are on track to reach this target by the end of fiscal 2018. Our entire company is critically focused on delivering on and exceeding our goal. Work spans many areas. We are realizing procurement and logistics savings using the power of the expanded size of our company to our advantage and purchasing around the world. We are benefiting from our comprehensive mill system, maximizing our ability to produce the right products in the right locations and in-sourcing paperboard throughout the system. And we are continuing to use best practices from each former company to develop the right models and streamline our businesses and corporate functions across of the company. 
We continue to make capital investments in our mills and converting operations with projects that reduce costs. Based on the strength of these and other initiatives, we exited the quarter at an annualized run rate of more than $250 million and are on track to achieve at least $450 million by the end of fiscal 2016. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined $68 million due primarily to the reductions in Specialty Chemicals, land and development business and the reduction in pension income. Adjusted EBITDA of our core consumer and Corrugated Packaging businesses and corporate expenses, excluding pension income, increased by $15 million. During the quarter, we generated $88 million in productivity, which demonstrates our continued focus and progress in this area. Our productivity more than offsets the negative impact of volume price and other negative market factors. We continue to benefit from deflation in key energy categories. 
Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our gas flow outlook and assumptions. We generate significant cash flow, and that is likely the key metric that has not been fully appreciated in this stock market. For fiscal 2016, we are forecasting cash flow provided by operations of between $1.8 billion and $1.825 billion, and capital expenditures in the range of $825 million to $850 million. As Steve reported, our net free cash flow should be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
We are including Ingevity's results in this outlook for the 7-month period that they we will be part of WestRock, and they will be excluded for the remaining 5 months. However, Ingevity's operating cash flow is equal to the forecasted capital expenditures for the period, as they are finishing their growth initiatives in China and Brazil and the winner is their seasonally slower time of the year. Our outlook reflects a view on the impact of recent PPW price changes on our Corrugated Packaging segment. 
Looking into the March quarter, there's a lot to be excited about in our business as we continue to execute on our strategy. From a financial standpoint, there are more seasonal headwinds in the March quarter on a sequential basis. We will have more energy usage due to the winter weather, and we will have some impact from the recent snowstorm that blanketed much of the Northeast. What would be more expensive than in the December quarter. In addition, the labor cost pool also resets with annual salary increases beginning, as well as the new year employment-related taxes. The mill is undergoing a major maintenance outage in March that will have a $10 million impact on income in the quarter. 
In the corrugated business, export pricing will likely continue, with some softening in pricing. Currencies will also have -- like we have some negative impact on the quarter. We will continue to deliver an our productivity and synergy improvement program, which is creating a lot of value. When all of this is taken into account, we expect that the March quarter will be lower on an adjusted EPS as compared to the $0.59 posted in December. I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

And considering the internalization that Steve mentioned in his opening comments, which came from opportunities to the merger created to the recent acquisition of the Cenveo Packaging business to the acquisition last year of the Carolina commercial print business, this brings a lot of SBS into our system that we are now producing internally. And so in terms of near-term outlook, we'll be up solidly. Now specific to Europe, what we see there is imports are attempting to penetrate, primarily in the more commodity end of the market, such as general markets and food service plate stock where we have less of a position. So in terms of direct impact for us, it's really been 0 out of Europe. And then in terms of Chinese imports, which I believe was your question, again, we're not seeing a significant impact there. The hurdles are fairly high at this stage for competition on that front. We have an advantage cost position. Again, we focus on a very diverse range of higher-end markets. We have quality advantage. And not to mention, there's a very high hurdle rate around the very complex supply chain that exists. It's a very complicated market to serve with very demanding customers and service requirements that we are well positioned. So net-net, not much effect that we're seeing from an import standpoint."

First of all, we are really excited about the opportunity to have acquired SP assets, specifically the Dublin Georgia mill. And I think the proposition goes back to how we look at our markets and our quest to improve the cost of the system. But you've seen us behave consistently in the way that we've matched our supply with demand. And over the last number of quarters, we've tried to balance our system through a combination of temporary shutdowns, slowbacks and permanent closures to try to get our system in just the right balance with our demand. The acquisition of SP Fiber in October gave us the capability to add 575,000 tons of really excellent quality low-cost, lightweight packaging grade papers in the center of our neural network of supply chain. And so that gave us the ability to build a very granular plan in order to improve the cost structure and service capability of our system. And so that allowed us to first permanently close the Coshocton mill in November. Secondly, to close permanently the Newberg news plant and packaging grade mill at November. And the latest move to close Uncasville medium mills, which will be permanently shut by January 31. So this acquisition has given us the ability to provide very good quality market demand substrates in a lower costs, both fixed and operating, and has allowed us to balance supply and demand in a much more efficient way, taking 675,000 tons out of the market. So I hope that gets to"

During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. Statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. We'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
Before we share the details about the quarter, I'd like to comment on one of the questions I get asked most frequently these days, which is how the merger integration going. Pleased to report the merger integration is going extremely well, I believe, even more strongly today than the strategic rationale of the merger than I did when we announced the merger one year ago. We have the first or second leading positions in attractive global packaging markets, and we're aggressively working to maximize the opportunities of the merger while improving operational efficiency across our organization. We've executing on and making meaningful progress with realizing our $1 billion in synergy and performance improvement opportunities.
Culturally, we're building an outstanding WestRock team that's aligned and focused on building the premier global packaging company. 
Our customers are very interested in using innovation to increase their sales and reducing their cost to increase their profitability. WestRock's suite of paper packaging and merchandising products and services, across a multinational platform, is enabling us to engage with customers in ways that no other company can. We're an integrated, global packaging solutions provider, and this is resonating with our customers. We're executing on our strategy, and we're working well together while doing so. We're taking advantage of the opportunities to improve our business through our investment in people, assets and acquisitions.
WestRock is a compelling value creation opportunity. We're well positioned to deliver value for stockholders. We're strong believers in managing the business to generate cash, we've aligned our strategy and to do just that. During our first 6 months of operation, we generated $609 million or $2.33 per share and free cash flow after adding back after-tax cash, merger and integration-related restructuring cost. For this fiscal year, we expect to generate in the range of $950 million to $1 billion free cash flow or approximately $3.75 per share based on our current share count. 
We've demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to stockholders. We've repurchased 9.5 million shares over the past 7 months and are paying an annual dividend of about $400 million. We intend to maintain our dividend after the spin of Specialty Chemicals. At yesterday's closing stock price, our current yield of 4.7% would increase to over 5% after completion of the spin.
Let's turn to the financial results for the quarter. WestRock sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were $0.59. Our last 12 months credit agreement EBITDA margin was 16.9%. These returns are largely in line with expectations. 
Our Corrugated Packaging business has performed well, with strong growth in box sales in the United States. We've managed our supply with our customer demand, and as a result, we've permanently closed 3 mills: Coshocton, MeadWestvaco and Uncasville with total annual capacity of 675,000 tons.
Our Brazilian Corrugated Packaging operations continued to perform exceptionally well. This business is providing great current returns and also providing attractive investment opportunities to improve our returns over the next several years.
We've added SP Fiber and some bale packaging businesses to our platform. We expect to complete our joint venture with Grupo Gondi during the first half of calendar year 2016. All 3 transactions add to the strength of our business. 
We've repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock since November. To date, we've bought back 9.5 million shares under our $40 million share repurchase authorization. We've reassessed our valuation for Specialty Chemicals business in light of changing market conditions and financial performance and lower comparative market valuations for their peer group. We've reduced the estimated enterprise value for Specialty Chemicals business and the purchase accounting value recorded last July to approximately $1.6 billion. As a result, we've recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $478 million.
We're making progress on the spin of Ingevity. Earlier this month, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to positively address each issue. We need this have addressed for the spin, including the removal of additional limitations on WestRock stock repurchases. We anticipate completion of the spin by early May, later than previously announced, due to the inherent complexities of the separation process. 
The Corrugated Packaging team delivered outstanding results across our North American box business, with box shipments up 2.9% on a per day basis. Box prices were stable sequentially. All regions of the United States did well, although we did have a slight decline in the west, principally due to a decline in produce volumes. 
We had particularly strong performance in e-commerce. We shipped 530,000 tons to domestic and export markets, including approximately 280,000 tons to domestic markets and 250,000 tons to export markets.  Without SP Fiber, domestic shipments were 86,000 tons less than last year, and our prices were essentially flat sequentially. Export channels continue to be price competitive. Overall export pricing was down $9 per ton on a sequential-quarter basis. 
We actively managed our system to meet our customer demand and took 264,000 tons of economic and maintenance downtime in the quarter. The incremental cost of the economic downtime was $11 million year-over-year. The closure of the Uncasville and Coshocton mills will reduce our annual operating cost by $25 million. 
The cumulative impact of these actions has balanced our containerboard system. We made solid gains in productivity with incremental contribution to pretax income of $36 million over last year. 
Brazil continued to perform very well, both individually and compared to the rest of the Brazilian market, with EBITDA margins of 24.8%. The trade saw mill in our virgin fiber supply are competitive advantage in this market. WestRock's box shipments increased 1% compared to the prior year. This is significantly more than the overall market in Brazil, which declined by 5%.
Turning to the Consumer Packaging segment. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2% grew by 160 basis points over last year. This is driven by strong performance in our packaging businesses, overall stable consumer mill volumes, productivity gains and energy deflation. Price and the mix were stable for the quarter. External SBS volumes from our mill system were modestly down, largely related to the loss of a customer last year.  Otherwise, we're seeing good growth in premium applications, including tobacco, commercial print and food service income. While the SBS market is challenged by slow demand and processed food applications, we're continuing to perform well across the diversified mix of end markets that we serve. We've seen a small amount of foreign competition in more commodity portions of the market, such as food service, freight and general markets. But this has not had an appreciable impact on our business.
In addition to external SBS sales, we're making good progress internalizing approximately 100,000 tons of incremental SBS production into our converting system, some opportunities identified during the merger, the recent acquisition of some bales packaging businesses.
Also in the quarter, we continued the integration of more than 150,000 tons of the Carolina commercial print business that we acquired last year. This production transitioned fully to our SBS system earlier this month. The net results of the gains and internal converting them to Carolina acquisition increased the loading and production efficiencies for SBS mill system. The combined CNK and beverage packaging businesses delivered a good quarter, as modest growth in global beer markets offset declines in carbonated soft drink volumes, particularly in North America. 
Our CRB mills operated well during the quarter and was executed on the $50 per ton price increase announced less summer. With the Cenveo Packaging acquisition, we will internalize an additional 5,000 tons of CRB into our system. 
Our folding carton converting business continues to perform well. Volumes exceeded of the overall market. Pricing was slightly down as contract renewals were competitive and some food customers experienced declining volumes. Home, health and beauty had a very good quarter, with strong European volumes more than offsetting some weakness in North America. Margin continues to improve with good mix, cost management and productivity.
Merchandising display sales declined due to lower commercial activity with key customers. The core business remains attractive, and we're continuing to optimize the fixed cost structure of this business to improve the profitability.
Turning to Specialty Chemicals. Depressed oil prices have reduced demand for oilfield chemicals and certain industry products. This has made competing petroleum-based chemistries more economical.
Total sales during the quarter declined by $31 million compared to last year. Segment EBITDA of $32 million was a little more than half of last year's quarter. Segment profitability also reflected $8.5 million in outage in China start-up expenses. The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for this business. 
Ingevity's annual revenue is running at more than $900 million, and adjusted EBITDA is now at an annual rate of approximately $200 million. The oilfield services business is now less than 10% of annual revenue at approximately $80 million. This business is relatively smaller compared to the total business. We achieved record quarterly sales for activated carbon and asphalt additive products. We have good growth engines in the asphalt additives and automotive carbon, including the new automotive carbon plant that's starting up in China. We have a strong profitable business, a very strong management team and the scale with which to operate as a successful public company. The long-term fundamentals of the business are sound and will make for a compelling growth equity story. Post spin, Ingevity will have reasonable leverage at about 2.5x EBITDA. This will provide an immediate cash inflow of approximately $400 million to WestRock at the time of the spin, plus funding an additional $80 million of security for a capital lease retained by WestRock. 
Our land business results reflected purchase price accounting step up with the assets to fair market value as of July 1 merger closing. The step up effectively removes what the anticipated development profit was at that time. This has no effect on cash flow, only on reported earnings.
Most important thing to know about this segment is that we're operating in Charlestown, one of the healthiest real estate markets in the country. We're looking at ways to monetize our portfolio faster than the normal development process would allow. We've already make some progress on certain projects, and we expect to do more on this front. 
Over the last several months, we completed the SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging acquisitions, with a total investment of approximately $400 million. Both SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging are great strategic fits with our business and strategy. We believe these businesses will generate excellent returns on investment.
We expect to complete the Grupo Gondi joint venture investment in the next couple of months. Mexico is very important to our customers and to us, due to its proximity to the United States and its strong growth profile. We've been looking from a long time for the right opportunity to grow our capabilities in Mexico, and I believe that the partnership with Grupo Gondi is the best way for WestRock to grow in Mexico. WestRock will contribute $175 million in cash in our 3 Mexican box plants, and Grupo Gondi will contribute their business. Based on current exchange rates in the last 12 months results, the joint venture on a pro forma basis has generated $670 million in sales and $135 million in EBITDA. Our box plants have generated about 10% to 15% of the $135 million. We will have a 25% interest in the joint venture, and the joint venture will have net positive cash on its balance sheet when the joint venture is formed. The cash that we're contributing will be invested by the joint venture to support growth. WestRock will continue to provide the 200,000 tons that we supplied to our 3 box plants, and we'll have continuing opportunities to supply additional tons if the joint venture grows. We're currently executing on an opportunity to supply 25,000 tons of kraftliner to Gondi that we were not supplying 6 months ago. We will have an opportunity to build upon our combined relationships and capabilities to grow in the attractive paper and packaging markets of Mexico. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ward for additional details."

Total non-allocated expenses were $4.5 million in the current quarter. We reduced corporate expenses by $21 million, and this is included as part of our $250 million synergy and productivity performance.Our non-service pension income i",818,"Thank you, Steve. Total non-allocated expenses were $4.5 million in the current quarter. We reduced corporate expenses by $21 million, and this is included as part of our $250 million synergy and productivity performance.
Our non-service pension income is $25 million lower than the $47 million recorded last year. This was principally a result of our pension derisking strategy, which was implemented to protect our overfunded pension plan status. We reallocated our investments to lower return asset categories, which reduced our pension income. Over U.S. qualified plans have $6.4 billion in assets. These are 108% funded and have lost very little value during the recent market disruptions. Our derisking strategy made a lot of sense last summer and even more now. We are one of the few U.S. companies and the only one of our peers with an overfunded pension plan and we are careful to protect that value. 
We have a very disciplined approach to realizing our synergies and performance improvements across our businesses and functions. We are executing on the opportunities and projects to reach our $1 billion goal and are on track to reach this target by the end of fiscal 2018. Our entire company is critically focused on delivering on and exceeding our goal. Work spans many areas. We are realizing procurement and logistics savings using the power of the expanded size of our company to our advantage and purchasing around the world. We are benefiting from our comprehensive mill system, maximizing our ability to produce the right products in the right locations and in-sourcing paperboard throughout the system. And we are continuing to use best practices from each former company to develop the right models and streamline our businesses and corporate functions across of the company.
We continue to make capital investments in our mills and converting operations, with projects that reduce costs. Based on the strength of these and other initiatives, we exited the quarter at an annualized run rate of more than $250 million and are on track to achieve at least $450 million by the end of fiscal 2016. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined $68 million, due primarily to the reductions in Specialty Chemicals, land and development business and the reduction in pension income. Adjusted EBITDA of our core Consumer and Corrugated Packaging businesses and corporate expenses, excluding pension income, increased by $15 million. During the quarter, we generated $88 million in productivity, which demonstrates our continued focus on progress in this area. Our productivity more than offsets the negative impact of volume price and other negative market factors. We continue to benefit from deflation in key energy categories.
Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our cash flow outlook and assumptions. We generate significant cash flow, and that is likely the key metric that has not been fully appreciated in this stock market. For fiscal 2016, we are forecasting cash flow provided by operation of between $1.8 billion and $1.825 billion and capital expenditures in the range of $825 million to $850 million. As Steve reported, our net free cash flow should be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
We are including Ingevity's results in this outlook for the 7-month period that they we will be part of WestRock, and they will be excluded the remaining 5 months. However, Ingevity's operating cash flow is equal to the forecasted capital expenditures for the period, as they are finishing their growth initiatives in China and Brazil and the winner is their seasonally slower time of the year. Our outlook reflects a view on the impact of recent PPW price changes on our Corrugated Packaging segment. 
Looking into the March quarter, there's a lot to be excited about in our business as we continue to execute on our strategy. From our financial standpoint, there are more seasonal headwinds in the March quarter on a sequential basis. We will have more energy usage due to the winter weather, and we will have some impact from the recent snowstorm that blanketed much of the Northeast. Wood will be more expensive than in the December quarter. In addition, the labor cost pool also resets with annual salary increases beginning as well as the New Year and employment-related taxes. The Mahrt mill is undergoing a major maintenance outage in March that will have a $10 million impact on income in the quarter. 
In the corrugated business, export pricing will likely continue, with some softening in pricing. Currencies will also have -- likely have some negative impact on the quarter. We will continue to deliver an our productivity and synergy improvement program, which is creating a lot of value. When all of this is taken into account, we expect that the March quarter will be lower on an adjusted EPS as compared to the $0.59 posted in December. 
I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

Just last quarter, we were up 2.9% on a per day basis, and that demand continues to be strong.

Let me just do a quick run through, starting with CRB and CNK, where backlogs are up from a year-on-year standpoint, although sequentially, we have seen some expected easing that's really seasonality. Overall, we're in good balance from a supply/demand standpoint, and the markets are generally stable. On SBS, the demand that we're seeing in the higher-end premium markets, where we concentrate our efforts, has been stable to up slightly. And that's a global statement. Backlogs are stable, and pricing is stable. And considering the internalization that Steve mentioned in his opening comments, which came from opportunities that the merger created to the recent acquisition of the Cenveo Packaging business to the acquisition last year of the Carolina commercial print business, this brings a lot of SBS into our system that we are now producing internally. And so in terms of near-term outlook, we'll be up solidly. Now specific to Europe, what we see there is imports are attempting to penetrate primarily in the more commodity end of the market, such as general markets and food service plate stock where we have less of a position. So in terms of direct impact for us, it's really been 0 out of Europe. And then in terms of Chinese imports, which I believe was your question, again, we're not seeing a significant impact there. The hurdles are fairly high at this stage for competition on that front. We have an advantage cost position. Again, we focus on a very diverse range of higher-end markets. We have a quality advantage. And not to mention, there's a very high hurdle rate around the very complex supply chain that exists. It's a very complicated market to serve with very demanding customers and service requirements that we are well positioned. So net-net, not much effect that we're seeing from an import standpoint."

But you've seen us behave consistently in a way that we've matched our supply with demand. And over the last number of quarters, we've tried to balance our system through a combination of temporary shutdowns, slow backs and permanent closures to try to get our system in just the right balance with our demand. The acquisition of SP Fiber in October gave us the capability to add 575,000 tons of really excellent quality, low-cost, lightweight packaging grade papers in the center of our neural network of supply chain. And so that gave us the ability to build a very granular plan in order to improve the cost structure and service capability of our system. And so that allowed us to first permanently close the Coshocton mill in November; secondly, to close permanently the Newberg plant and packaging grade mill at November; and our latest move to close Uncasville medium mills, which will be permanently shut by January 31. So this acquisition has given us the ability to provide very good quality market demand substrates in a lower costs, both fixed and operating, and has allowed us to balance supply with demand in a much more efficient way, taking 675,000 tons out of the market.

I don't think it's a function of management bandwidth, I could say, function of priorities. And if you look at the opportunities that we have, we have an incredible opportunity to operate our businesses while even better than they have. We have a very, let's say, a lot of opportunity to bring more money to the bottom line through the focus on our own business. And so when I look at our priorities, I think, acquisition is probably less of a relative priority than it might have been in the past, because the opportunities we have to combine our organization and go to market and operating even more efficiently. So I think internal focus is probably relatively greater priority than it would have been to me previously. Now having said that, the acquisitions that we've made, I think, have been strategic and have been helpful to our business. So we'll continue to look at them. I just don't see them as, in response your questions, high priority as they might have been in the past."

Welcome to our conference call. I'm Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business. 
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. Statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. We'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
Before we share the details about the quarter, I'd like to comment on one of the questions I get asked most frequently these days, which is how's the merger integration going. Pleased to report the merger integration is going extremely well, I believe even more strongly today in the strategic rationale of the merger than I did when we announced the merger one year ago. We have the first or second leading positions in attractive global packaging markets, and we're aggressively working to maximize the opportunities of the merger while improving operational efficiency across our organization. We've executing on and making meaningful progress toward realizing our $1 billion in synergy and performance improvement opportunities.
Culturally, we're building an outstanding WestRock team that's aligned and focused on building the premier global packaging company. 
Our customers are very interested in using innovation to increase their sales and reducing their cost to increase their profitability. WestRock's suite of paper packaging and merchandising products and services, across a multinational platform, is enabling us to engage with customers in ways that no other company can. We're an integrated, global packaging solutions provider, and this is resonating with our customers. We're executing on our strategy, and we're working well together while doing so. We're taking advantage of the opportunities to improve our business through our investment in people, assets and acquisitions.
WestRock is a compelling value creation opportunity. We're well positioned to deliver value for stockholders. We're strong believers in managing the business to generate cash, we've aligned our strategy and incentives to do just that. During our first 6 months of operation, we generated $609 million or $2.33 per share in free cash flow after adding back after-tax cash, merger and integration-related restructuring cost. For this fiscal year, we expect to generate in the range of $950 million to $1 billion free cash flow or approximately $3.75 per share based on our current share count. 
We've demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to stockholders. We've repurchased 9.5 million shares over the past 7 months and are paying an annual dividend of about $400 million. We intend to maintain our dividend after the spin of Specialty Chemicals. At yesterday's closing stock price, our current yield of 4.7% would increase to over 5% after completion of the spin.
Let's turn to the financial results for the quarter. WestRock sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were $0.59. Our last 12 months credit agreement EBITDA margin was 16.9%. These returns are largely in line with expectations. 
Our Corrugated Packaging business has performed well, with strong growth in box sales in the United States. We've managed our supply with our customer demand, and as a result, we've permanently closed 3 mills: Coshocton, Newberg and Uncasville with total annual capacity of 675,000 tons.
Our Brazilian Corrugated Packaging operations continued to perform exceptionally well. This business is providing great current returns and also providing attractive investment opportunities to improve our returns over the next several years.
We've added SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging businesses to our platform. We expect to complete our joint venture with Grupo Gondi during the first half of calendar year 2016. All 3 transactions add to the strength of our business. 
We've repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock since November. To date, we've bought back 9.5 million shares under our $40 million share repurchase authorization. We've reassessed our valuation of the Specialty Chemicals business in light of changing market conditions and financial performance and lower comparative market valuations for their peer group. We've reduced the estimated enterprise value for Specialty Chemicals business and the purchase accounting value reported last July to approximately $1.6 billion. As a result, we've recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $478 million.
We're making progress on the spin of Ingevity. Earlier this month, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to positively address each issue we needed to have addressed for the spin, including the removal of additional limitations on WestRock stock repurchases. We anticipate completion of the spin by early May, later than previously announced, due to the inherent complexities of the separation process. 
The Corrugated Packaging team delivered outstanding results across our North American box business, with box shipments up 2.9% on a per day basis. Box prices were stable sequentially. All regions of the United States did well, although we did have a slight decline in the West, principally due to a decline in produce volumes. 
We had particularly strong performance in e-commerce. We shipped 530,000 tons to domestic and export markets, including approximately 280,000 tons to domestic markets and 250,000 tons to export markets. Without SP Fiber, domestic shipments were 86,000 tons less than last year, and our prices were essentially flat sequentially. Export channels continued to be price competitive. Overall export pricing was down $9 per ton on a sequential-quarter basis. 
We actively managed our system to meet our customer demand and took 264,000 tons of economic and maintenance downtime in the quarter. The incremental cost of the economic downtime was $11 million year-over-year. The closure of the Uncasville and Coshocton mills will reduce our annual operating cost by $25 million. 
The cumulative impact of these actions has balanced our containerboard system. We made solid gains in productivity with incremental contribution to the pretax income of $36 million over last year. 
Brazil continued to perform very well, both individually and compared to the rest of the Brazilian market, with EBITDA margins of 24.8%. The Três Barras mill and our virgin fiber supply are a competitive advantage in this market. WestRock's box shipments increased 1% compared to the prior year. This is significantly more than the overall market in Brazil, which declined by 5%.
Turning to the Consumer Packaging segment. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2% grew by 160 basis points over last year. This is driven by strong performance in our packaging businesses, overall stable consumer mill volumes, productivity gains and energy deflation. Price and the mix were stable for the quarter. External SBS volumes from our mill system were modestly down, largely related to the loss of a customer last year. Otherwise, we're seeing good growth in premium applications, including tobacco, commercial print and food service cup. While the SBS market is challenged by slow demand and processed food applications, we're continuing to perform well across the diversified mix of end markets that we serve. We've seen a small amount of foreign competition in more commodity portions of the market, such as food service, plate and general markets. But this has not had an appreciable impact on our business.
In addition to external SBS sales, we're making good progress internalizing approximately 100,000 tons of incremental SBS production into our converting system, some opportunities identified during the merger -- the recent acquisition of Cenveo's packaging businesses.
Also in the quarter, we continued the integration of more than 150,000 tons of the Carolina commercial print business that we acquired last year. This production transitioned fully to our SBS system earlier this month. The net results of the gains and internal converting in the Carolina acquisition increased the loading and production efficiencies for our SBS and mill system. The combined CNK and beverage packaging businesses delivered a good quarter, as modest growth in global beer markets offset declines in carbonated soft drink volumes, particularly in North America. 
Our CRB mills operated well during the quarter and we've executed on the $50 per ton price increase announced last summer. With the Cenveo Packaging acquisition we will internalize an additional 5,000 tons of CRB into our system. 
Our folding carton converting business continues to perform well. Volumes growth exceeded that of the overall market. Pricing was slightly down as contract renewals were competitive and some food customers experienced declining volumes. Home, health and beauty had a very good quarter, with strong European volumes more than offsetting some weakness in North America. Margin continues to improve with good mix, cost management and productivity.
Merchandising display sales declined due to lower commercial activity with key customers. The core business remains attractive, and we're continuing to optimize the fixed cost structure of this business to improve profitability.
Turning to Specialty Chemicals. Depressed oil prices have reduced demand for oilfield chemicals and certain industrial products. This has made competing petroleum-based chemistries more economical.
Total sales during the quarter declined by $31 million compared to last year. Segment EBITDA of $32 million was a little more than half of last year's quarter. Segment profitability also reflected $8.5 million in outage and China start-up expenses. The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for this business. 
Ingevity's annual revenue is running at more than $900 million, and adjusted EBITDA is now at an annual rate of approximately $200 million. The oilfield services business is now less than 10% of annual revenue at approximately $80 million. This business is relatively small compared to the total business. We achieved record quarterly sales for activated carbon and asphalt additive products. We have good growth engines in the asphalt additives and automotive carbon, including the new automotive carbon plant that's starting up in China. We have a strong profitable business, a very strong management team and the scale with which to operate as a successful public company. The long-term fundamentals of the business are sound and will make for a compelling growth equity story. Post spin, Ingevity will have reasonable leverage at about 2.5x EBITDA. This will provide an immediate cash inflow of approximately $400 million to WestRock at the time of the spin, plus funding an additional $80 million in security for a capital lease retained by WestRock. 
Our land business results reflect a purchase price accounting step up of the assets to fair market value as of the July 1 merger closing. The step up effectively removes what the anticipated development profit was at the time. This has no effect on cash flow, only on reported earnings.
Most important thing to know about this segment is that we're operating in Charlestown, one of the healthiest real estate markets in the country. We're looking at ways to monetize our portfolio faster than the normal development process would allow. We've already make some progress on certain projects, and we expect to do more on this front. 
Over the last several months, we completed the SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging acquisitions, with a total investment of approximately $400 million. Both SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging are great strategic fits with our business and strategy. We believe these businesses will generate excellent returns on investment.
We expect to complete the Grupo Gondi joint venture investment in the next couple of months. Mexico is very important to our customers and to us, due to its proximity to the United States and its strong growth profile. We've been looking for a long time for the right opportunity to grow our capabilities in Mexico, and I believe that the partnership with Grupo Gondi is the best way for WestRock to grow in Mexico. WestRock will contribute $175 million in cash and our 3 Mexican box plants, and Grupo Gondi will contribute their business. Based on current exchange rates and the last 12 months results, the joint venture on a pro forma basis has generated $670 million in sales and $135 million in EBITDA. Our box plants have generated about 10% to 15% of the $135 million. We will have a 25% interest in the joint venture, and the joint venture will have net positive cash on its balance sheet when the joint venture is formed. The cash that we're contributing will be invested by the joint venture to support growth. WestRock will continue to provide the 200,000 tons that we supplied to our 3 box plants, and we'll have continuing opportunities to supply additional tons as the joint venture grows. We're currently executing on an opportunity to supply 25,000 tons of kraftliner to Gondi that we were not supplying 6 months ago. We will have the opportunity to build upon our combined relationships and capabilities to grow in the attractive paper and packaging markets of Mexico. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ward for additional details."

Total of non-allocated expenses were $4.5 million in the current quarter. We reduced corporate expenses by $21 million, and this is included as part of our $250 million synergy and productivity performance.
Our non-service pension income is $25 million lower than the $47 million recorded last year. This was principally a result of our pension derisking strategy, which was implemented to protect our overfunded pension plan status. We reallocated our investments to lower return asset categories, which reduced our pension income. Our U.S. qualified plans have $6.4 billion in assets. These are 108% funded and have lost very little value during the recent market disruptions. Our derisking strategy made a lot of sense last summer and even more now. We are one of the few U.S. companies and the only one of our peers with an overfunded pension plan and we are careful to protect that value. 
We have a very disciplined approach to realizing our synergies and performance improvements across our businesses and functions. We are executing on the opportunities and projects to reach our $1 billion goal and are on track to reach this target by the end of fiscal 2018. Our entire company is critically focused on delivering on and exceeding our goal. Work spans many areas. We are realizing procurement and logistics savings using the power of the expanded size of our company to our advantage in purchasing around the world. We are benefiting from our comprehensive mill system, maximizing our ability to produce the right products in the right locations and in-sourcing paperboard throughout the system. And we are continuing to use best practices from each former company to develop the right models and streamline our businesses and corporate functions across the company.
We continue to make capital investments in our mills and converting operations, with projects that reduce cost. Based on the strength of these and other initiatives, we exited the quarter at an annualized run rate of more than $250 million and are on track to achieve at least $450 million by the end of fiscal 2016. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined $68 million, due primarily to the reductions in Specialty Chemicals, the Land and Development business and the reduction in pension income. Adjusted EBITDA of our core Consumer and Corrugated Packaging businesses and corporate expenses, excluding pension income, increased by $15 million. During the quarter, we generated $88 million in productivity, which demonstrates our continued focus on progress in this area. Our productivity more than offsets the negative impact of volume price and other negative market factors. We continue to benefit from deflation in key energy categories.
Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our cash flow outlook and assumptions. We generate significant cash flow, and that is likely the key metric that has not been fully appreciated in this stock market. For fiscal 2016, we are forecasting cash flow provided by operations of between $1.8 billion and $1.825 billion and capital expenditures in the range of $825 million to $850 million. As Steve reported, our net free cash flow should be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
We are including Ingevity's results in this outlook for the 7-month period that they we will be part of WestRock, and they will be excluded for the remaining 5 months. However, Ingevity's operating cash flow is equal to the forecasted capital expenditures for the period, as they are finishing their growth initiatives in China and Brazil and the winter is their seasonally slower time of the year. Our outlook reflects a view on the impact of recent PPW price changes on our Corrugated Packaging segment. 
Looking into the March quarter, there's a lot to be excited about in our business as we continue to execute on our strategy. From a financial standpoint, there are more seasonal headwinds in the March quarter on a sequential basis. We will have more energy usage due to the winter weather, and we will have some impact from the recent snowstorm that blanketed much of the Northeast. Wood will be more expensive than in the December quarter. In addition, the labor cost pool also resets with annual salary increases beginning as well as a new year of employment-related taxes. The Mahrt mill is undergoing a major maintenance outage in March that will have a $10 million impact on income in the quarter. 
In the corrugated business, export pricing will likely continue, with some softening in pricing. Currencies will also have -- likely have some negative impact on the quarter. We will continue to deliver on our productivity and synergy improvement program, which is creating a lot of value. When all of this is taken into account, we expect that the March quarter will be lower on an adjusted EPS as compared to the $0.59 posted in December. 
I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

Now we're -- after 12 months of exceptional growth, we're going to be entering a period where the comps are getting tougher. But current demand, as evidenced by our backlogs, continues to be strong.

Let me just do a quick run through, starting with CRB and CNK, where backlogs are up from a year-on-year standpoint, although sequentially, we have seen some expected easing that's really seasonality. Overall, we're in good balance from a supply and demand standpoint, and the markets are generally stable. On SBS, the demand that we're seeing in the higher-end premium markets, where we concentrate our efforts, has been stable to up slightly. And that's a global statement. Backlogs are stable, and pricing is stable. And considering the internalization that Steve mentioned in his opening comments, which came from opportunities that the merger created to the recent acquisition of the Cenveo Packaging business to the acquisition last year of the Carolina commercial print business, this brings a lot of SBS into our system that we are now producing internally. And so in terms of near-term outlook, we'll be up solidly. Now specific to Europe, what we see there is imports are attempting to penetrate primarily in the more commodity end of the market, such as general markets and food service plate stock where we have less of a position. So in terms of direct impact for us, it's really been 0 out of Europe. And then in terms of Chinese imports, which I believe was your question, again, we're not seeing a significant impact there. The hurdles are fairly high at this stage for competition on that front. We have an advantage cost position. Again, we focus on a very diverse range of higher-end markets. We have a quality advantage. And not to mention, there's a very high hurdle rate around the very complex supply chain that exists. It's a very complicated market to serve with very demanding customers and service requirements that we are well positioned. So net-net, not much effect that we're seeing from an import standpoint."

First of all, we are really excited about the opportunity to have acquired the SP asset, specifically the Dublin, Georgia mill. And I think the proposition goes back to how we look at our markets and our quest to improve the cost of the system. But you've seen us behave consistently in a way that we've matched our supply with demand. And over the last number of quarters, we've tried to balance our system through a combination of temporary shutdowns, slow backs and permanent closures to try to get our system in just the right balance with our demand. The acquisition of SP Fiber in October gave us the capability to add 575,000 tons of really excellent quality, low-cost, lightweight packaging grade papers in the center of our neural network of supply chain. And so that gave us the ability to build a very granular plan in order to improve the cost structure and service capability of our system. And so that allowed us to first permanently close the Coshocton mill in November; secondly, to close permanently the Newberg newsprint and packaging grade mill in mid-November; and our latest move to close Uncasville media mill, which will be permanently shut by January 31. So this acquisition has given us the ability to provide very good quality market demand substrates in a lower cost, both fixed and operating, and has allowed us to balance supply with demand in a much more efficient way, taking 675,000 tons out of the market. So I hope that gives clarity to our move."

Welcome to our conference call. I'm Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business. 
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. Statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. We'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
Before we share the details about the quarter, I'd like to comment on one of the questions I get asked most frequently these days, which is how's the merger integration going. Pleased to report the merger integration is going extremely well, I believe even more strongly today in the strategic rationale of the merger than I did when we announced the merger one year ago. We have the first or second leading positions in attractive global packaging markets, and we're aggressively working to maximize the opportunities of the merger while improving operational efficiency across our organization. We've executing on and making meaningful progress toward realizing our $1 billion in synergy and performance improvement opportunities.
Culturally, we're building an outstanding WestRock team that's aligned and focused on building the premier global packaging company. 
Our customers are very interested in using innovation to increase their sales and reducing their cost to increase their profitability. WestRock's suite of paper packaging and merchandising products and services, across a multinational platform, is enabling us to engage with customers in ways that no other company can. We're an integrated, global packaging solutions provider, and this is resonating with our customers. We're executing on our strategy, and we're working well together while doing so. We're taking advantage of the opportunities to improve our business through our investment in people, assets and acquisitions.
WestRock is a compelling value creation opportunity. We're well positioned to deliver value for stockholders. We're strong believers in managing the business to generate cash, we've aligned our strategy and incentives to do just that. During our first 6 months of operation, we generated $609 million or $2.33 per share in free cash flow after adding back after-tax cash, merger and integration-related restructuring cost. For this fiscal year, we expect to generate in the range of $950 million to $1 billion free cash flow or approximately $3.75 per share based on our current share count. 
We've demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to stockholders. We've repurchased 9.5 million shares over the past 7 months and are paying an annual dividend of about $400 million. We intend to maintain our dividend after the spin of Specialty Chemicals. At yesterday's closing stock price, our current yield of 4.7% would increase to over 5% after completion of the spin.
Let's turn to the financial results for the quarter. WestRock sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were $0.59. Our last 12 months credit agreement EBITDA margin was 16.9%. These returns are largely in line with expectations. 
Our Corrugated Packaging business has performed well, with strong growth in box sales in the United States. We've managed our supply with our customer demand, and as a result, we've permanently closed 3 mills: Coshocton, Newberg and Uncasville with total annual capacity of 675,000 tons.
Our Brazilian Corrugated Packaging operations continued to perform exceptionally well. This business is providing great current returns and also providing attractive investment opportunities to improve our returns over the next several years.
We've added SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging businesses to our platform. We expect to complete our joint venture with Grupo Gondi during the first half of calendar year 2016. All 3 transactions add to the strength of our business. 
We've repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock since November. To date, we've bought back 9.5 million shares under our $40 million share repurchase authorization. We've reassessed our valuation of the Specialty Chemicals business in light of changing market conditions and financial performance and lower comparative market valuations for their peer group. We've reduced the estimated enterprise value for Specialty Chemicals business and the purchase accounting value reported last July to approximately $1.6 billion. As a result, we've recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $478 million.
We're making progress on the spin of Ingevity. Earlier this month, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to positively address each issue we needed to have addressed for the spin, including the removal of additional limitations on WestRock stock repurchases. We anticipate completion of the spin by early May, later than previously announced, due to the inherent complexities of the separation process. 
The Corrugated Packaging team delivered outstanding results across our North American box business, with box shipments up 2.9% on a per day basis. Box prices were stable sequentially. All regions of the United States did well, although we did have a slight decline in the West, principally due to a decline in produce volumes. 
We had particularly strong performance in e-commerce. We shipped 530,000 tons to domestic and export markets, including approximately 280,000 tons to domestic markets and 250,000 tons to export markets. Without SP Fiber, domestic shipments were 86,000 tons less than last year, and our prices were essentially flat sequentially. Export channels continued to be price competitive. Overall export pricing was down $9 per ton on a sequential-quarter basis. 
We actively managed our system to meet our customer demand and took 264,000 tons of economic and maintenance downtime in the quarter. The incremental cost of the economic downtime was $11 million year-over-year. The closure of the Uncasville and Coshocton mills will reduce our annual operating cost by $25 million. 
The cumulative impact of these actions has balanced our containerboard system. We made solid gains in productivity with incremental contribution to the pretax income of $36 million over last year. 
Brazil continued to perform very well, both individually and compared to the rest of the Brazilian market, with EBITDA margins of 24.8%. The Três Barras mill and our virgin fiber supply are a competitive advantage in this market. WestRock's box shipments increased 1% compared to the prior year. This is significantly more than the overall market in Brazil, which declined by 5%.
Turning to the Consumer Packaging segment. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2% grew by 160 basis points over last year. This is driven by strong performance in our packaging businesses, overall stable consumer mill volumes, productivity gains and energy deflation. Price and the mix were stable for the quarter. External SBS volumes from our mill system were modestly down, largely related to the loss of a customer last year. Otherwise, we're seeing good growth in premium applications, including tobacco, commercial print and food service cup. While the SBS market is challenged by slow demand and processed food applications, we're continuing to perform well across the diversified mix of end markets that we serve. We've seen a small amount of foreign competition in more commodity portions of the market, such as food service, plate and general markets. But this has not had an appreciable impact on our business.
In addition to external SBS sales, we're making good progress internalizing approximately 100,000 tons of incremental SBS production into our converting system, some opportunities identified during the merger -- the recent acquisition of Cenveo's packaging businesses.
Also in the quarter, we continued the integration of more than 150,000 tons of the Carolina commercial print business that we acquired last year. This production transitioned fully to our SBS system earlier this month. The net results of the gains and internal converting in the Carolina acquisition increased the loading and production efficiencies for our SBS and mill system. The combined CNK and beverage packaging businesses delivered a good quarter, as modest growth in global beer markets offset declines in carbonated soft drink volumes, particularly in North America. 
Our CRB mills operated well during the quarter and we've executed on the $50 per ton price increase announced last summer. With the Cenveo Packaging acquisition we will internalize an additional 5,000 tons of CRB into our system. 
Our folding carton converting business continues to perform well. Volumes growth exceeded that of the overall market. Pricing was slightly down as contract renewals were competitive and some food customers experienced declining volumes. Home, health and beauty had a very good quarter, with strong European volumes more than offsetting some weakness in North America. Margin continues to improve with good mix, cost management and productivity.
Merchandising display sales declined due to lower commercial activity with key customers. The core business remains attractive, and we're continuing to optimize the fixed cost structure of this business to improve profitability.
Turning to Specialty Chemicals. Depressed oil prices have reduced demand for oilfield chemicals and certain industrial products. This has made competing petroleum-based chemistries more economical.
Total sales during the quarter declined by $31 million compared to last year. Segment EBITDA of $32 million was a little more than half of last year's quarter. Segment profitability also reflected $8.5 million in outage and China start-up expenses. The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for this business. 
Ingevity's annual revenue is running at more than $900 million, and adjusted EBITDA is now at an annual rate of approximately $200 million. The oilfield services business is now less than 10% of annual revenue at approximately $80 million. This business is relatively small compared to the total business. We achieved record quarterly sales for activated carbon and asphalt additive products. We have good growth engines in the asphalt additives and automotive carbon, including the new automotive carbon plant that's starting up in China. We have a strong profitable business, a very strong management team and the scale with which to operate as a successful public company. The long-term fundamentals of the business are sound and will make for a compelling growth equity story. Post spin, Ingevity will have reasonable leverage at about 2.5x EBITDA. This will provide an immediate cash inflow of approximately $400 million to WestRock at the time of the spin, plus funding an additional $80 million in security for a capital lease retained by WestRock. 
Our land business results reflect a purchase price accounting step up of the assets to fair market value as of the July 1 merger closing. The step up effectively removes what the anticipated development profit was at the time. This has no effect on cash flow, only on reported earnings.
Most important thing to know about this segment is that we're operating in Charlestown, one of the healthiest real estate markets in the country. We're looking at ways to monetize our portfolio faster than the normal development process would allow. We've already make some progress on certain projects, and we expect to do more on this front. 
Over the last several months, we completed the SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging acquisitions, with a total investment of approximately $400 million. Both SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging are great strategic fits with our business and strategy. We believe these businesses will generate excellent returns on investment.
We expect to complete the Grupo Gondi joint venture investment in the next couple of months. Mexico is very important to our customers and to us, due to its proximity to the United States and its strong growth profile. We've been looking for a long time for the right opportunity to grow our capabilities in Mexico, and I believe that the partnership with Grupo Gondi is the best way for WestRock to grow in Mexico. WestRock will contribute $175 million in cash and our 3 Mexican box plants, and Grupo Gondi will contribute their business. Based on current exchange rates and the last 12 months results, the joint venture on a pro forma basis has generated $670 million in sales and $135 million in EBITDA. Our box plants have generated about 10% to 15% of the $135 million. We will have a 25% interest in the joint venture, and the joint venture will have net positive cash on its balance sheet when the joint venture is formed. The cash that we're contributing will be invested by the joint venture to support growth. WestRock will continue to provide the 200,000 tons that we supplied to our 3 box plants, and we'll have continuing opportunities to supply additional tons as the joint venture grows. We're currently executing on an opportunity to supply 25,000 tons of kraftliner to Gondi that we were not supplying 6 months ago. We will have the opportunity to build upon our combined relationships and capabilities to grow in the attractive paper and packaging markets of Mexico. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ward for additional details."

Total of non-allocated expenses were $4.5 million in the current quarter. We reduced corporate expenses by $21 million, and this is included as part of our $250 million synergy and productivity performance.Our non-service pension incom",820,"Thank you, Steve. Total of non-allocated expenses were $4.5 million in the current quarter. We reduced corporate expenses by $21 million, and this is included as part of our $250 million synergy and productivity performance.
Our non-service pension income is $25 million lower than the $47 million recorded last year. This was principally a result of our pension derisking strategy, which was implemented to protect our overfunded pension plan status. We reallocated our investments to lower return asset categories, which reduced our pension income. Our U.S. qualified plans have $6.4 billion in assets. These are 108% funded and have lost very little value during the recent market disruptions. Our derisking strategy made a lot of sense last summer and even more now. We are one of the few U.S. companies and the only one of our peers with an overfunded pension plan and we are careful to protect that value. 
We have a very disciplined approach to realizing our synergies and performance improvements across our businesses and functions. We are executing on the opportunities and projects to reach our $1 billion goal and are on track to reach this target by the end of fiscal 2018. Our entire company is critically focused on delivering on and exceeding our goal. Work spans many areas. We are realizing procurement and logistics savings using the power of the expanded size of our company to our advantage in purchasing around the world. We are benefiting from our comprehensive mill system, maximizing our ability to produce the right products in the right locations and in-sourcing paperboard throughout the system. And we are continuing to use best practices from each former company to develop the right models and streamline our businesses and corporate functions across the company.
We continue to make capital investments in our mills and converting operations, with projects that reduce cost. Based on the strength of these and other initiatives, we exited the quarter at an annualized run rate of more than $250 million and are on track to achieve at least $450 million by the end of fiscal 2016. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined $68 million, due primarily to the reductions in Specialty Chemicals, the Land and Development business and the reduction in pension income. Adjusted EBITDA of our core Consumer and Corrugated Packaging businesses and corporate expenses, excluding pension income, increased by $15 million. During the quarter, we generated $88 million in productivity, which demonstrates our continued focus on progress in this area. Our productivity more than offsets the negative impact of volume price and other negative market factors. We continue to benefit from deflation in key energy categories.
Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our cash flow outlook and assumptions. We generate significant cash flow, and that is likely the key metric that has not been fully appreciated in this stock market. For fiscal 2016, we are forecasting cash flow provided by operations of between $1.8 billion and $1.825 billion and capital expenditures in the range of $825 million to $850 million. As Steve reported, our net free cash flow should be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. 
We are including Ingevity's results in this outlook for the 7-month period that they we will be part of WestRock, and they will be excluded for the remaining 5 months. However, Ingevity's operating cash flow is equal to the forecasted capital expenditures for the period, as they are finishing their growth initiatives in China and Brazil and the winter is their seasonally slower time of the year. Our outlook reflects a view on the impact of recent PPW price changes on our Corrugated Packaging segment. 
Looking into the March quarter, there's a lot to be excited about in our business as we continue to execute on our strategy. From a financial standpoint, there are more seasonal headwinds in the March quarter on a sequential basis. We will have more energy usage due to the winter weather, and we will have some impact from the recent snowstorm that blanketed much of the Northeast. Wood will be more expensive than in the December quarter. In addition, the labor cost pool also resets with annual salary increases beginning as well as a new year of employment-related taxes. The Mahrt mill is undergoing a major maintenance outage in March that will have a $10 million impact on income in the quarter. 
In the corrugated business, export pricing will likely continue, with some softening in pricing. Currencies will also have -- likely have some negative impact on the quarter. We will continue to deliver on our productivity and synergy improvement program, which is creating a lot of value. When all of this is taken into account, we expect that the March quarter will be lower on an adjusted EPS as compared to the $0.59 posted in December. 
I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

With that, we're pleased to respond to your questions."

This last quarter we were up 2.9% on a per day basis, and that demand continues to be strong. Now we're -- after 12 months of exceptional growth, we're going to be entering a period where the comps are getting tougher. But current demand, as evidenced by our backlogs, continues to be strong. Now as Steve mentioned, we've had some weather events to January that will probably put a dent in those numbers, but we expect that by the end of the quarter, we should be flat on a year-over-year basis."

Let me just do a quick run through, starting with CRB and CNK, where backlogs are up from a year-on-year standpoint, although sequentially, we have seen some expected easing that's really seasonality. Overall, we're in good balance from a supply and demand standpoint, and the markets are generally stable. On SBS, the demand that we're seeing in the higher-end premium markets, where we concentrate our efforts, has been stable to up slightly. And that's a global statement. Backlogs are stable, and pricing is stable. And considering the internalization that Steve mentioned in his opening comments, which came from opportunities that the merger created to the recent acquisition of the Cenveo Packaging business to the acquisition last year of the Carolina commercial print business, this brings a lot of SBS into our system that we are now producing internally. And so in terms of near-term outlook, we'll be up solidly. Now specific to Europe, what we see there is imports are attempting to penetrate primarily in the more commodity end of the market, such as general markets and food service plate stock where we have less of a position. So in terms of direct impact for us, it's really been 0 out of Europe. And then in terms of Chinese imports, which I believe was your question, again, we're not seeing a significant impact there. The hurdles are fairly high at this stage for competition on that front. We have an advantage cost position. Again, we focus on a very diverse range of higher-end markets. We have a quality advantage. And not to mention, there's a very high hurdle rate around the very complex supply chain that exists. It's a very complicated market to serve with very demanding customers and service requirements that we are well positioned. So net-net, not much effect that we're seeing from an import standpoint."

First of all, we are really excited about the opportunity to have acquired the SP asset, specifically the Dublin, Georgia mill. And I think the proposition goes back to how we look at our markets and our quest to improve the cost of the system. But you've seen us behave consistently in a way that we've matched our supply with demand. And over the last number of quarters, we've tried to balance our system through a combination of temporary shutdowns, slow backs and permanent closures to try to get our system in just the right balance with our demand. The acquisition of SP Fiber in October gave us the capability to add 575,000 tons of really excellent quality, low-cost, lightweight packaging grade papers in the center of our neural network of supply chain. And so that gave us the ability to build a very granular plan in order to improve the cost structure and service capability of our system. And so that allowed us to first permanently close the Coshocton mill in November; secondly, to close permanently the Newberg newsprint and packaging grade mill in mid-November; and our latest move to close Uncasville media mill, which will be permanently shut by January 31. So this acquisition has given us the ability to provide very good quality market demand substrates in a lower cost, both fixed and operating, and has allowed us to balance supply with demand in a much more efficient way, taking 675,000 tons out of the market. So I hope that gives clarity to our move."

Welcome to our Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer.  I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business. 
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and include our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and our 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2015. 
We will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
Before Ward and I discuss our quarterly results in detail, I want to take a moment to underscore the reasons that WestRock is a compelling value creation opportunity. WestRock holds #1 or #2 positions in attractive paper and packaging markets. We're providing differentiated tailored packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace. Our strategy is sound and we're achieving the objectives that we outlined when we created WestRock. We've already delivered $350 million or over 1/3 of our $1 billion synergy and performance improvement target in the past 9 months. We expect to be at an annualized run rate of $450 million to $500 million by the end of our fiscal year in September. 
We've added to the strength of our business, most recently to the formation of our joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the leading paper and packaging company in Mexico. With the separation of Ingevity in the next 2 weeks, we will remove our noncore business from our portfolio. We manage our business to generate long-term cash flow and we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $950 million to $1 billion for fiscal 2016. After adjusting for the separation of Ingevity, this will provide an attractive 10% free cash flow yield at our current share price. 
We're returning our free cash flow to stockholders through our $1.50 per share annual dividend that we plan to maintain after the separation of Ingevity. We're continuing our balanced capital allocation strategy that includes paying a very attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases with our 2.25 to 2.5x leverage ratio target. All told, we're executing well on our strategy and this is reflected in our results for the quarter.
WestRock sales for the March quarter were $3.7 billion, an adjusted earnings per share of $0.61. We performed well both commercially and operationally. Over the last 12 months, our Credit Agreement EBITDA margin was 17.4%. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $81 million in the quarter and a total of $432 million fiscal year-to-date. The impact of our synergies and performance improvements is being reflected in our reported financial results. The March quarter productivity improvements increased EBITDA by $103 million year-over-year. 
We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the March quarter at an average price of $39. About half of these purchases were in January at a price of $43 per share. The other half of these purchases were in February and March at an average price of $35 per share. Since July 1, with the inception of WestRock, we've repurchased 11.2 million shares. We've returned $856 million in capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the corrugated industry, domestic end-use markets are flat to slightly up. Operating rates have continued to be in the mid-90s with declining inventories overall and we're headed into the seasonally stronger time of the year. 
Our Corrugated Packaging business continues to improve with good operational and commercial execution. E-commerce: dairy and produce markets were strong for us in the quarter with some softness in beverage, retail and bakery. Corrugated Packaging net sales in the quarter were $1.9 billion with EBITDA of $316 million. North American corrugated EBITDA margins of 17.5% increased by 20 basis points over the prior year. Total segment shipments in the quarter were 2.2 million tons, an increase of 5% over last year and large part due to the increased kraft bag volumes at our mill in Dublin, Georgia. 
We continue to balance our supply with customer demand. The majority of the 40,000 tons of economic downtime that we took this quarter was medium downtime in January, and advance of the final closure date at Uncasville. Our mills system was in balance during February and March. We've taken 35,000 tons of maintenance and economic downtime so far in April. 10,000 pounds of the 35,000 has been economic downtime. While our shipments of containerboard to the domestic independent market declined by 8,000 tons sequentially, our average price per ton for this portfolio of sales to this market increased by between $1 and $2 per ton sequentially. This was principally due to the positive mix change where we sold an increasing proportion of liner and white top liner.
Export demand remains solid although pricing remains very competitive due to the strength of the U.S. dollar and the availability of supply from Brazil, Russia and Finland. We exported 304,000 tons, 18,000 tons more than last year while our mix of export business was consistent with 62% going to Latin America and the rest going to combination of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our portfolio of export pricing declined $43 per ton compared to last year and was down $18 per ton sequentially. 
Turning to our North American box business. Our box pricing was stable both compared to last year and sequentially. Our domestic box shipments were slightly up on an absolute basis and down 1% on a same day basis as compared to last year. Last year was a very strong quarter for WestRock and is therefore, a very tough comparison. We're experiencing similar pricing and volume trends so far this quarter. We feel good about the demand environment and see positive momentum with the commercial opportunities we've had and how we're competing and winning in the marketplace. We're improving operationally as a result of our productivity programs and our ongoing capital investment to upgrade our capabilities. 
We're now installing the 21st of 30 EVOLs, a project that started 2 years ago that we expect to complete by the middle of fiscal year '17. We've grown our volumes in excess of the industry in 13 of the last 15 months, and continue to be confident in our ability to profitably grow our box business. In Brazil. Our performance remains strong despite challenges the country is facing. Our combined corrugated box and container board shipments increased by 13%. We're capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export linerboard to offset the impact of the contracting domestic box market. 
Now turning to our Consumer Packaging business. Favorable financial performance year-over-year is driven by strong operational and commercial performance. We continue to realize larger synergy benefits. Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.6 billion and EBITDA was $224 million, up from the $181 million in the prior-year quarter. We delivered $58 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress that we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements available to us. Industry backlogs for all of our consumer board grades stabilized during the quarter. We exited the quarter with backlogs ranging from 2 to 4 weeks, and are now moving from the 3 to 5-week range.
In SBS, our shipments increase 50,000 tons in the second quarter. This was fueled by solid growth in tobacco, food service, the on boarding of the Carolina brand business and additional internal demand from our folding carton plants. Tobacco. We're continuing to have success in business development with China premium tobacco brands. We see solid growth in food service cups, driven by the ongoing of foam cups to more sustainable paper cups. In commercial print. We're successful in working with our merchant partners to capitalize on the strength of our expanded offering of SBS for commercial front. This offering now includes both the Carolina and tango brands. We're pleased with the integration of the Carolina brand and we manufactured 12,000 tons of this product in the quarter. We expect the Carolina tons that we manufacture to increased to annual rate in excess of 150,000 tons during the June quarter. 
Our Covington and Demopolis mills performed so well that we needed to balance supply with demand in our SBS system. As a result, we produced 31,000 tons more pulp primarily at Evadale. Pulp prices were $73 per ton lower than last year, this is reflected in the pulp pricing mix shown on the bridge. More broadly in the paperboard markets, we're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian competitors. Pricing was stable in our core markets with some discounting to more commodity portions of the food service plate and carton markets. The recent published price productions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp & Paper Week will have limited impact in fiscal year '16. This limited impact is reflected in our cash flow guidance. 
The SBS price decrease applies to only general folding carton markets to less than 50% of our total SBS volume. The folding carton markets remained challenged by soft primary demand for processed, frozen and dried foods. This is consistent with the ongoing consumer preference for fresh foods in the shrinking center of the supermarket. With this backdrop, our folding carton performed exceedingly well in the quarter and is benefiting from our differentiated strategy. We're now on boarding new folding customers that were previously only box customers of WestRock and we secured an e-business for our SBS, CRB and CMK systems. Folding carton volumes grew by 6% in the quarter and 2%, excluding the impact of the Cenveo acquisition. Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. The business is performing at expectations.
Our beverage business. We've achieved gains in global beer and sparkling water markets, that offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand primarily in North America. We are growing our customers that have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multi packs and Latin America and China. Home, health and beauty had a very strong quarter with EBITDA margins of more than 18%, driven by positive sales mix especially in Europe. Continued cost focus and our record productivity quarter for the business. 
In merchandising displays. Customer promotional activity has stabilized. We're entering a significantly stronger time of the year. We're taking action to balance our capacity with current market demand, which will exclude our cost structure and improve our margins. We have tremendous capabilities in our display business. And over the past several months, we've received 31 industry awards for work we performed to support companies such as: Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate, Coca-Cola and [indiscernible] brands. We're nearing completion of our review of our Land and Development portfolio. Working with the team in Charleston, we accelerated the monetization of some projects. That's reflected in a significant increase in our sales under contract figures. 
The original plan for this year had modestly negative cash flows and current plans have positive pretax cash flows for the year. We'll share more detail with you on the upcoming quarters on our progress in monetizing specific projects within our portfolio. The separation of Ingevity is expected to occur on May 15. The Ingevity management team led by Michael Wilson, will be on their equity roadshow over the next 2 weeks. As part of the separation, WestRock will receive a distribution of $518 million, retain approximately $438 million in cash after expenses that we can use for general corporate purchases -- purposes. Ingevity has the right team and strategy in place. I'm looking forward to following Ingevity success as an independent company.
As a result of the separation, WestRock's Credit Agreement EBITDA will decline by the amount generated by Ingevity of about $200 million in EBITDA on a trailing basis. After adjusting for this, WestRock's leverage ratio post separation will be in the 2.35 to 2.4x range within our target. We've outlined WestRock's results for the quarter of with and without Ingevity and these numbers should help you in your model. Ingevity contributed $0.08 in adjusted EPS in the quarter. For June 2016 quarter, we will reflect the 6 weeks of Ingevity operations as discontinued operations.
We closed on our new joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Gondi on April 1. We believe that Gondi is the premier operator in the market. Based on the recent performance, we expect the joint venture to generate annual sales of more than $750 million and EBITDA margins in excess of 21%. We're currently supplying the joint venture with container board at a rate of 250,000 tons per year. Importantly, the $175 million that we've contributed to the joint venture will remain in the joint venture and be available to support its growth. As an example, Gondi has just started production on a new state-of-the-art 120,000 metric ton box plant in Nava. This plant is adjacent to the new Constellation Brands brewery. This joint venture accelerates our ability to win in the growing Mexican packaging market and gives both WestRock and Gondi many new growth opportunities. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ward."

We exited the March quarter with an annualized run rate of savings of $350 million. We continue to realize procurement and logistics savings in the expanding scale we now have enables us to be more efficient overall. We can balance our system over this larger footprint, producing the right products in the right locations to better serve our customers and maximize efficiency.
In addition, work is continuing to streamline our businesses and corporate functions across our company. We expect to be in the $450 million to $500 million run rate range by this September, and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of FY '18. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased $29 million due primarily to the $103 million in productivity. Commodity imports cost deflation of $37 million and the flow through of these into our businesses. The negative pulp, price and mix impact across our corrugated and consumer businesses was $23 million. Natural gas was the biggest input cost savings area with $21 million in lower cost compared to the prior year. 
Lower chemicals, freight, diesel, wood, fiber and other costs contributed an additional $16 million to income. The reduction to pension income is a noncash charge that negatively impacts earnings. Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our cash flow, outlook and assumptions. 
We are maintaining our cash flow guidance for FY '16 of $950 million to $1 billion. As we think about our business for the third quarter, there are several key items to help you with your modeling. As a starting point. Our March adjusted EPS of $0.61 includes $0.08 of Ingevity. Using that adjusted base and looking sequentially, you should consider some of the following trends that will affect our earnings in the June quarter: we expect to see some seasonal volume increases with negative price and mix across our businesses related to export markets and the PPW changes in both corrugated and consumer grades; we anticipate price inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas and recycled fiber; our book tax rates are expected to be in the range of 34% to 36%; net of any contribution from Ingevity, we expect an increase in adjusted earnings per share in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. 
I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

The second quarter '15, we were up 6.5% on a per day basis. So this past quarter, we were virtually flat on an absolute basis or up slightly that is, and down slightly on a per day basis. So that is a little bit behind the industry. But we've got a very strong pipeline of new opportunities. And we would expect to see some seasonal strengthening as we go into Q3.

On the other hand, we certainly acknowledge that prices have become incredibly competitive, largely due to new machine start-up in northern Europe and the Russian and Brazilian economies, which is taking board produced in those countries that aren't being cut up in boxes in those countries, so we're seeing that in other parts of the world. And with the currency differential they have over the U.S. dollar, it has put a significant impact on price. So to your question of is it getting better, we have seen some currency strengthening.

We've already delivered $350 million or over 1/3 of our $1 billion synergy and performance improvement target in the past 9 months. We expect to be at an annualized run rate of $450 million to $500 million by the end of our fiscal year in September. 
We've added to the strength of our business, most recently through the formation of our joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the leading paper and packaging company in Mexico. And with the separation of Ingevity over the next 2 weeks, we will remove a noncore business from our portfolio. 
We manage our business to generate long-term cash flow, and we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $950 million to $1 billion for fiscal 2016. After adjusting for the separation of Ingevity, this would provide an attractive 10% free cash flow yield at our current share price. 
We're returning our free cash flow to stockholders through our $1.50 per share annual dividend that we plan to maintain after the separation of Ingevity. We're continuing our balanced capital allocation strategy that includes paying a very attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases with our 2.25 to 2.5x leverage ratio target. All told, we're executing well on our strategy, and this is reflected in our results for the quarter.
WestRock sales for the March quarter were $3.7 billion, an adjusted earnings per share over [ph] $0.61. We performed well, both commercially and operationally. Over the last 12 months, our Credit Agreement EBITDA margin was 17.4%. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $81 million in the quarter and a total of $432 million fiscal year-to-date. 
The impact of our synergies and performance improvements is being reflected in our reported financial results. For the March quarter, productivity improvements increased EBITDA by $103 million year-over-year. 
We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the March quarter at an average price of $39. About half of these purchases were in January at a price of $43 per share. The other half of these purchases were in February and March at an average price of $35 per share. Since July 1, with the inception of WestRock, we've repurchased 11.2 million shares, and we've returned $856 million in capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In the corrugated industry, domestic end-use markets are flat to slightly up. Operating rates have continued to be in the mid-90s with declining inventories overall, and we're headed into the seasonally stronger time of the year. 
Our Corrugated Packaging business continues to improve with good operational and commercial execution. E-commerce, dairy and produce markets were strong for us in the quarter, with some softness in beverage, retail and bakery. 
Corrugated Packaging net sales in the quarter were $1.9 billion with EBITDA of $316 million. North American corrugated EBITDA margins of 17.5% increased by 20 basis points over the prior year. Total segment shipments in the quarter were 2.2 million tons, an increase of 5% over last year in large part to the increased kraft bag volumes at our mill in Dublin, Georgia. 
We continue to balance our supply with customer demand. The majority of the 30,000 tons of economic downtime that we took this quarter was medium downtime in January in advance of the final closure date at Uncasville. Our mills system was in balance during February and March. We've taken 35,000 tons of maintenance and economic downtime so far in April. 10,000 tons of the 35,000 has been economic downtime. 
While our shipments of containerboard to the domestic independent market declined by 8,000 tons sequentially, our average price per ton for this portfolio of sales to this market increased by between $1 and $2 per ton sequentially. This was principally due to the positive mix change where we sold an increasing proportion of liner and white top liner.
Export demand remained solid, although pricing remains very competitive due to the strength of the U.S. dollar and the availability of supply from Brazil, Russia and Finland. We exported 304,000 tons, 18,000 tons more than last year, while our mix of export business was consistent with 62% going to Latin America and the rest going to a combination of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our portfolio of export pricing declined $43 per ton compared to last year and was down $18 per ton sequentially. 
Turning to our North American box business. Our box pricing was stable, both compared to last year and sequentially. Our domestic box shipments were slightly up on an absolute basis and down 1% on a same-day basis as compared to last year. Last year was a very strong quarter for WestRock and is, therefore, a very tough comparison. We're experiencing similar pricing and volume trends so far this quarter. 
We feel good about the demand environment and see positive momentum with the commercial opportunities we have and how we're competing and winning in the marketplace. We're improving operationally as a result of our productivity programs and our ongoing capital investment to upgrade our capabilities. 
We're now installing the 21st of 30 EVOLs, a project that started 2 years ago that we expect to complete by the middle of fiscal year '17. We've grown our volumes in excess of the industry in 13 of the last 15 months and continue to be confident in our ability to profitably grow our box business. 
In Brazil, our performance remained strong despite challenges the country is facing. Our combined corrugated box and container board shipments increased by 13%. We're capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export linerboard to offset the impact of a contracting domestic box market. 
Now turning to our Consumer Packaging business. Favorable financial performance year-over-year was driven by strong operational and commercial performance, and we continued to realize merger synergy benefits. 
Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.6 billion and EBITDA was $224 million, up from the $181 million in the prior year quarter. We delivered $58 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress that we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements available to us. 
Industry backlogs for all of our consumer board grades stabilized during the quarter. We exited the quarter with backlogs ranging from 2 to 4 weeks, and are now moving from the 3- to 5-week range.
In SBS, our shipments increase 50,000 tons in the second quarter. This was fueled by solid growth in tobacco, food service, the on-boarding of the Carolina brand business and additional internal demand from our folding carton plants. 
Tobacco. We're continuing to have success in business development with China premium tobacco brands. We see solid growth in food service cup, driven by the ongoing conversion of foam cups to more sustainable paper cups. 
In commercial print, we are successful in working with our merchant partners to capitalize on the strength of our expanded offering of SBS for commercial print. This offering now includes both the Carolina and Tango brands. We're pleased with the integration of the Carolina brand, and we manufactured 12,000 tons of this product in the quarter. We expect the Carolina tons that we manufacture to increase to an annual rate in excess of 150,000 tons during the June quarter. 
Our Covington and Demopolis mills performed so well that we needed to balance supply with demand in our SBS system. As a result, we produced 31,000 tons more pulp, primarily at Evadale. Pulp prices were $73 per ton lower than last year. This is reflected in the pulp price and mix shown on the bridge. 
More broadly, in the paperboard markets, we're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian competitors. Pricing was stable in our core markets, with some discounting in more commodity portions of the food service plate and folding carton markets. The recent published price productions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp & Paper Week will have limited impact in fiscal year '16. This limited impact is reflected in our cash flow guidance. 
The SBS price decrease applies only to general folding carton markets to less than 50% of our total SBS volume. The folding carton markets remained challenged by soft primary demand for processed, frozen and dry foods. This is consistent with the ongoing consumer preference for fresh foods in the shrinking center of the supermarket. With this backdrop, our folding carton team performed exceedingly well during the quarter and is benefiting from our differentiated strategy. 
We're now on-boarding new folding customers that were previously only box customers of WestRock, and we've secured new business for our SBS, CRB and CNK systems. Folding carton volumes grew by 6% in the quarter and 2% excluding the impact of the Cenveo acquisition. Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. The business is performing at expectations.
Our beverage business. We've achieved gains in global beer and sparkling water markets that offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand, primarily in North America. We are growing with customers that have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multipacks in Latin America and China. 
Home, health and beauty had a very strong quarter, with EBITDA margins of more than 18%, driven by positive sales mix, especially in Europe, continued cost focus and a record productivity quarter for the business. 
In merchandising displays, customer promotional activity has stabilized, and we're entering a seasonally stronger time of the year. We're taking action to balance our capacity with current market demand, which will include our cost structure and improve our margins. We have tremendous capabilities in our display business, and over the past several months, we've received 31 industry awards for work we performed to support companies such as: Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate, Coca-Cola and Newell Brands. 
We're nearing completion of our review of our Land and Development portfolio. Working with the team in Charleston, we've accelerated the monetization of some projects. That's reflected in a significant increase in our sales under contract figures. 
The original plan for this year had modestly negative cash flows and current plans have positive pretax cash flows for the year. We'll share more detail with you on the upcoming quarters on our progress in monetizing specific projects within our portfolio. 
The separation of Ingevity is expected to occur on May 15. The Ingevity management team, led by Michael Wilson, will be on their equity road show over the next 2 weeks. As part of the separation, WestRock will receive a distribution of $518 million and retain approximately $438 million in cash after expenses that we can use for general corporate purchases -- purposes. Ingevity has the right team and strategy in place. I'm looking forward to following Ingevity's successes as an independent company.
As a result of the separation, WestRock's Credit Agreement EBITDA will decline by the amount generated by Ingevity or about $200 million in EBITDA on a trailing basis. After adjusting for this, WestRock's leverage ratio post separation will be in the 2.35 to 2.4x range, within our target. 
We've outlined WestRock's results for the quarter both with and without Ingevity, and these numbers should help you in your modeling. Ingevity contributed $0.08 in adjusted EPS in the quarter. For June 2016 quarter, we will reflect the 6 weeks of Ingevity operations as discontinued operations.
We closed on our new joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Gondi on April 1. We believe that Gondi is the premier operator in the market. Based on their recent performance, we expect the joint venture to generate annual sales of more than $750 million and EBITDA margins in excess of 20%. We're currently supplying the joint venture with containerboard at a rate of 250,000 tons per year. Importantly, the $175 million that we've contributed to the joint venture will remain in the joint venture and be available to support its growth. As an example, Gondi has just started production on a new state-of-the-art 120,000-metric-ton box plant in Nava. This plant is adjacent to the new Constellation Brands brewery. This joint venture accelerates our ability to win in the growing Mexican packaging market and gives both WestRock and Gondi many new growth opportunities. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ward."

We exited the March quarter with an annualized run rate of savings of $350 million. We continue to realize procurement and logistics savings, and the expanded scale we now have enables us to be more efficient overall. We can balance our system over this larger footprint, producing the right products in the right locations to better serve our customers and maximize efficiency.
In addition, work is continuing to streamline our businesses and corporate functions across our company. We expect to be in the $450 million to $500 million run rate range by this September, and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of FY '18. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased $29 million due primarily to the $103 million in productivity, commodity input cost deflation of $37 million and the flow-through of these into our businesses. The negative pulp price and mix impact across our corrugated and consumer businesses was $23 million. Natural gas was the biggest input cost savings area with $21 million in lower cost compared to the prior year. 
Lower chemicals, freight, diesel, wood, fiber and other costs contributed an additional $16 million to income. The reduction in pension income is a noncash charge that negatively affects earnings. 
Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our cash flow, outlook and assumptions. We are maintaining our cash flow guidance for FY '16 of $950 million to $1 billion. As we think about our business for the third quarter, there are several key items to help you with your modeling. As a starting point. Our March adjusted EPS of $0.61 includes $0.08 of Ingevity. Using that adjusted base and looking sequentially, you should consider some of the following trends that will affect our earnings in the June quarter: we expect to see some seasonal volume increases, with negative price and mix across our businesses related to export markets and the PPW changes in both corrugated and consumer grades; we anticipate price inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas and recycled fiber; our book tax rates are expected to be in the range of 34% to 36%. Net of any contribution from Ingevity, we expect an increase in adjusted earnings per share in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. 
I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

So first of all, I couldn't be more excited about how our Corrugated Packaging business is operating. Just made tremendous improvement from a culture and quality service innovation and satisfying our customers, which really is the foundation of the wins that we've been seeing. Really proud of the team. And that's allowed us to equal or exceed the industry performance in 13 out of the last 15 months. However, comps are getting a little tougher. The second quarter of '15, we were up 6.5% on a per-day basis. So this past quarter, we were virtually flat on an absolute basis -- or up slightly, that is, and down slightly on a per-day basis. So that is a little bit behind the industry. But we're -- we've got a very strong pipeline of new opportunities, and we would expect to see some seasonal strengthening as we go into Q3.

Currently, that bag has been operating in the 90,000 to 100,000 tons -- about 90,000 tons a quarter. And it's -- again, it remains a good grade for us.

And first of all, the global demand has been solid. Over the last couple of years, it's averaged 4%. I think, the last quarter, North American exports was up 3.6%. So we can see solid demand principally for virgin containerboard. We've developed a very strong series of relationships across the world that, frankly, value our virgin containerboard on quality, service, supply chain, consistent delivery to them month in and month out. So there's more to it than price. On the other hand, we certainly acknowledge that prices have become incredibly competitive, largely due to a new machine startup in Northern Europe and the Russian and Brazilian economies, which is taking board produced in those countries that aren't being cut up in boxes in those countries. We're seeing that in other parts of the world. And with the currency differential they have over the U.S. dollar, it has put a significant impact on price. So to your question of, is it getting better? We have seen some currency strengthening. So we would expect that to contribute to the pricing scenario. We have, as you know, rightsized our portfolio some, so we are not supplying all the business across the world that we once did.

I think a couple examples, we serve a lot of consumer products companies, and a lot of the consumer products companies use preprint. And so we've been able to take the preprint offering to Brazil and working with a customer that we would serve in North America to add preprint to their packaging.

I do believe, for CapEx spending, we will be on the low end of the range. We gave a range of $825 million to $850 million. I think the best place to refer you to for the D&A is the exhibit that has our business excluding Ingevity. As you look at the Q2, I think it showed that the quarterly run rate for D&A excluding Ingevity was just over $270 million. And you can use that as you start to think forward with some additional capital expenditures as we exit the year. We did not go through line by line all the other assumptions, but the pension and postretirement funding is consistent with what we said in January. I actually think the operating cash flow range is also consistent. Cash taxes may be a little bit higher as we look -- I had said that the cash taxes would be in the -- tax rate for the year would be in the mid-, high 20s. I think it'll be just above 30% as we exit the year."

Welcome to our fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business. 
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and include our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and our 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2015. 
We will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
Before Ward and I discuss our quarterly results in detail, I want to take a moment to underscore the reasons why WestRock is a compelling value-creation opportunity. WestRock holds #1 or #2 positions in attractive paper and packaging markets. We're providing differentiated, tailored packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace. Our strategy is sound, and we're achieving the objectives that we outlined when we created WestRock. We've already delivered $350 million or over 1/3 of our $1 billion synergy and performance improvement target in the past 9 months. We expect to be at an annualized run rate of $450 million to $500 million by the end of our fiscal year in September. 
We've added to the strength of our business, most recently through the formation of our joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the leading paper and packaging company in Mexico. And with the separation of Ingevity over the next 2 weeks, we will remove a noncore business from our portfolio. 
We manage our business to generate long-term cash flow, and we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $950 million to $1 billion for fiscal 2016. After adjusting for the separation of Ingevity, this would provide an attractive 10% free cash flow yield at our current share price. 
We're returning our free cash flow to stockholders through our $1.50 per share annual dividend that we plan to maintain after the separation of Ingevity. We're continuing our balanced capital allocation strategy that includes paying a very attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases with our 2.25 to 2.5x leverage ratio target. All told, we're executing well on our strategy, and this is reflected in our results for the quarter.
WestRock sales for the March quarter were $3.7 billion, an adjusted earnings per share were  $0.61. We performed well, both commercially and operationally. Over the last 12 months, our Credit Agreement EBITDA margin was 17.4%. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $81 million in the quarter and a total of $432 million fiscal year-to-date. 
The impact of our synergies and performance improvements is being reflected in our reported financial results. The March quarter, productivity improvements increased EBITDA by $103 million year-over-year. 
We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the March quarter at an average price of $39. About half of these purchases were in January at a price of $43 per share. The other half of these purchases were in February and March at an average price of $35 per share. Since July 1, with the inception of WestRock, we've repurchased 11.2 million shares, and we've returned $856 million in capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In the corrugated industry, domestic end-use markets are flat to slightly up. Operating rates have continued to be in the mid-90s with declining inventories overall, and we're headed into the seasonally stronger time of the year. 
Our Corrugated Packaging business continues to improve with good operational and commercial execution. E-commerce, dairy and produce markets were strong for us in the quarter, with some softness in beverage, retail and bakery. 
Corrugated Packaging net sales in the quarter were $1.9 billion with EBITDA of $316 million. North American corrugated EBITDA margins of 17.5% increased by 20 basis points over the prior year. Total segment shipments in the quarter were 2.2 million tons, an increase of 5% over last year in large part to the increased kraft bag volumes at our mill in Dublin, Georgia. 
We continue to balance our supply with customer demand. The majority of the 30,000 tons of economic downtime that we took this quarter was medium downtime in January in advance of the final closure date at Uncasville. Our mills system was in balance during February and March. We've taken 35,000 tons of maintenance and economic downtime so far in April. 10,000 tons of the 35,000 has been economic downtime. 
While our shipments of containerboard to the domestic independent market declined by 8,000 tons sequentially, our average price per ton for this portfolio of sales to this market increased by between $1 and $2 per ton sequentially. This was principally due to the positive mix change where we sold an increasing proportion of liner and white top liner.
Export demand remained solid, although pricing remains very competitive due to the strength of the U.S. dollar and the availability of supply from Brazil, Russia and Finland. We exported 304,000 tons, 18,000 tons more than last year, while our mix of export business was consistent with 62% going to Latin America and the rest going to a combination of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our portfolio of export pricing declined $43 per ton compared to last year and was down $18 per ton sequentially. 
Turning to our North American box business. Our box pricing was stable, both compared to last year and sequentially. Our domestic box shipments were slightly up on an absolute basis and down 1% on a same-day basis as compared to last year. Last year was a very strong quarter for WestRock and is, therefore, a very tough comparison. We're experiencing similar pricing and volume trends so far this quarter. 
We feel good about the demand environment and see positive momentum with the commercial opportunities we have and how we're competing and winning in the marketplace. We're improving operationally as a result of our productivity programs and our ongoing capital investment to upgrade our capabilities. 
We're now installing the 21st of 30 EVOLs, a project that started 2 years ago that we expect to complete by the middle of fiscal year '17. We've grown our volumes in excess of the industry in 13 of the last 15 months and continue to be confident in our ability to profitably grow our box business. 
In Brazil, our performance remained strong despite challenges the country is facing. Our combined corrugated box and container board shipments increased by 13%. We're capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export linerboard to offset the impact of a contracting domestic box market. 
Now turning to our Consumer Packaging business. Favorable financial performance year-over-year was driven by strong operational and commercial performance, and we continue to realize merger synergy benefits. 
Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.6 billion and EBITDA was $224 million, up from the $181 million in the prior year quarter. We delivered $58 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress that we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements available to us. 
Industry backlogs for all of our consumer board grades stabilized during the quarter. We exited the quarter with backlogs ranging from 2 to 4 weeks, and are now moving from the 3- to 5-week range.
In SBS, our shipments increase 50,000 tons in the second quarter. This was fueled by solid growth in tobacco, food service, the on-boarding of the Carolina brand business and additional internal demand from our folding carton plants. 
Tobacco. We're continuing to have success in business development with China premium tobacco brands. We see solid growth in food service cup, driven by the ongoing conversion of foam cups to more sustainable paper cups. 
In commercial print, we are successful in working with our merchant partners to capitalize on the strength of our expanded offering of SBS for commercial print. This offering now includes both the Carolina and Tango brands. We're pleased with the integration of the Carolina brand, and we manufactured 12,000 tons of this product in the quarter. We expect the Carolina tons that we manufacture to increase to an annual rate in excess of 150,000 tons during the June quarter. 
Our Covington and Demopolis mills performed so well that we needed to balance supply with demand in our SBS system. As a result, we produced 31,000 tons more pulp, primarily at Evadale. Pulp prices were $73 per ton lower than last year. This is reflected in the pulp price/mix shown on the bridge. 
More broadly, in the paperboard markets, we're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian competitors. Pricing was stable in our core markets, with some discounting in more commodity portions of the food service plate and folding carton markets. The recent published price reductions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp & Paper Week will have limited impact in fiscal year '16. This limited impact is reflected in our cash flow guidance. 
The SBS price decrease applies only to general folding carton markets to less than 50% of our total SBS volume. The folding carton markets remained challenged by soft primary demand for processed, frozen and dry foods. This is consistent with the ongoing consumer preference for fresh foods and the shrinking center of the supermarket. With this backdrop, our folding carton team performed exceedingly well during the quarter and is benefiting from our differentiated strategy. 
We're now on-boarding new folding customers that were previously only box customers of WestRock, and we've secured new business for our SBS, CRB and CNK systems. Folding carton volumes grew by 6% in the quarter and 2% excluding the impact of the Cenveo acquisition. Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. The business is performing at expectations.
In our beverage business we've achieved gains in global beer and sparkling water markets that offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand, primarily in North America. We are growing with customers that have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multipacks in Latin America and China. 
Home, health and beauty had a very strong quarter, with EBITDA margins of more than 18%, driven by positive sales mix, especially in Europe, continued cost focus and a record productivity quarter for the business. 
In merchandising displays, customer promotional activity has stabilized, and we're entering a seasonally stronger time of the year. We're taking action to balance our capacity with current market demand, which will improve our cost structure and improve our margins. We have tremendous capabilities in our display business, and over the past several months, we've received 31 industry awards for work we performed to support companies such as: Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate, Coca-Cola and Newell Brands. 
We're nearing completion of our review of our Land and Development portfolio. Working with the team in Charleston, we've accelerated the monetization of some projects. That's reflected in a significant increase in our sales under contract figures. 
The original plan for this year had modestly negative cash flows and current plans have positive pretax cash flows for the year. We'll share more detail with you in the upcoming quarters on our progress in monetizing specific projects within our portfolio. 
The separation of Ingevity is expected to occur on May 15. The Ingevity management team, led by Michael Wilson, will be on their equity road show over the next 2 weeks. As part of the separation, WestRock will receive a distribution of $518 million and retain approximately $438 million in cash after expenses that we can use for general corporate purchases -- purposes. Ingevity has the right team and strategy in place. I'm looking forward to following Ingevity's successes as an independent company.
As a result of the separation, WestRock's Credit Agreement EBITDA will decline by the amount generated by Ingevity or about $200 million in EBITDA on a trailing basis. After adjusting for this, WestRock's leverage ratio post separation will be in the 2.35 to 2.4x range, within our target. 
We've outlined WestRock's results for the quarter both with and without Ingevity, and these numbers should help you in your modeling. Ingevity contributed $0.08 in adjusted EPS in the quarter. The June 2016 quarter, will reflect the 6 weeks of Ingevity operations as discontinued operations.
We closed on our new joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Gondi on April 1. We believe that Gondi is the premier operator in the market. Based on their recent performance, we expect the joint venture to generate annual sales of more than $750 million and EBITDA margins in excess of 20%. We're currently supplying the joint venture with containerboard at a rate of 250,000 tons per year. Importantly, the $175 million that we've contributed to the joint venture will remain in the joint venture and be available to support its growth. As an example, Gondi has just started production on a new state-of-the-art 120,000-metric-ton box plant in Nava. This plant is adjacent to the new Constellation Brands brewery. This joint venture accelerates our ability to win in the growing Mexican packaging market and gives both WestRock and Gondi many new growth opportunities. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ward."

We exited the March quarter with an annualized run rate of savings of $350 million. We continue to realize procurement and logistics savings, and the expanded scale we now have enables us to be more efficient overall. We can balance our system over this larger footprint, producing the right products in the right locations to better serve our customers and maximize efficiency.
In addition, work is continuing to streamline our businesses and corporate functions across our company. We expect to be in the $450 million to $500 million run rate range by this September, and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of FY '18. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased $29 million due primarily to the $103 million in productivity, commodity input cost deflation of $37 million and the flow-through of these into our businesses. The negative pulp price and mix impact across our corrugated and consumer businesses was $23 million. Natural gas was the biggest input cost savings area with $21 million in lower cost compared to the prior year. 
Lower chemicals, freight, diesel, wood, fiber and other costs contributed an additional $16 million to income. The reduction in pension income is a noncash charge that negatively affects earnings. 
Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our cash flow, outlook and assumptions. We are maintaining our cash flow guidance for FY '16 of $950 million to $1 billion. As we think about our business for the third quarter, there are several key items to help you with your modeling. As a starting point. Our March adjusted EPS of $0.61 includes $0.08 of Ingevity. Using that adjusted base and looking sequentially, you should consider some of the following trends that will affect our earnings in the June quarter: we expect to see some seasonal volume increases, with negative price and mix across our businesses related to export markets and the PPW changes in both corrugated and consumer grades; we anticipate price inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas and recycled fiber; our book tax rates are expected to be in the range of 34% to 36%. Net of any contribution from Ingevity, we expect an increase in adjusted earnings per share in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. 
I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

We're delivering on the objectives we set out when we created WestRock, and we're well on our way to achieving our synergy and performance improvement target that contributed to over $100 million in productivity gains in the quarter.

With the separation of Ingevity next month, we'll remove a noncore business from our portfolio. 
We're generating attractive free cash flow returns, have the opportunity to grow this cash flow over time through execution of our strategy. We're returning a significant portion of our cash flow to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.

The second quarter of '15, we were up 6.5% on a per-day basis. So this past quarter, we were virtually flat on an absolute basis -- or up slightly, that is, and down slightly on a per-day basis. So that is a little bit behind the industry. But we're -- we've got a very strong pipeline of new opportunities, and we would expect to see some seasonal strengthening as we go into Q3.

And so we've been able to take the preprint offering to Brazil and working with a customer that we would serve in North America to add preprint to their packaging. And we think it has the potential to help them sell more product. There is a number of examples about that. I think we are -- the reason I say we're in the early innings is -- while we have a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of connection, I think we can get better at institutionalizing that through the company. I don't often talk about IT projects, but last week, we had a lot of excitement because we went live on a single instance of Salesforce, which is going to allow much better transparency throughout the organization about the relationships that we have across the organization. I think -- through time, I think it's going to grow in the contribution that it makes to the success of WestRock."

Welcome to our fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business. 
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and include our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and our 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2015. 
We will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
Before Ward and I discuss our quarterly results in detail, I want to take a moment to underscore the reasons why WestRock is a compelling value-creation opportunity. WestRock holds #1 or #2 positions in attractive paper and packaging markets. We're providing differentiated, tailored packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace. Our strategy is sound, and we're achieving the objectives that we outlined when we created WestRock. We've already delivered $350 million or over 1/3 of our $1 billion synergy and performance improvement target in the past 9 months. We expect to be at an annualized run rate of $450 million to $500 million by the end of our fiscal year in September. 
We've added to the strength of our business, most recently through the formation of our joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the leading paper and packaging company in Mexico. And with the separation of Ingevity over the next 2 weeks, we will remove a noncore business from our portfolio. 
We manage our business to generate long-term cash flow, and we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $950 million to $1 billion for fiscal 2016. After adjusting for the separation of Ingevity, this would provide an attractive 10% free cash flow yield at our current share price. 
We're returning our free cash flow to stockholders through our $1.50 per share annual dividend that we plan to maintain after the separation of Ingevity. We're continuing our balanced capital allocation strategy that includes paying a very attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases with our 2.25 to 2.5x leverage ratio target. All told, we're executing well on our strategy, and this is reflected in our results for the quarter.
WestRock sales for the March quarter were $3.7 billion, an adjusted earnings per share were  $0.61. We performed well, both commercially and operationally. Over the last 12 months, our Credit Agreement EBITDA margin was 17.4%. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $81 million in the quarter and a total of $432 million fiscal year-to-date. 
The impact of our synergies and performance improvements is being reflected in our reported financial results. The March quarter, productivity improvements increased EBITDA by $103 million year-over-year. 
We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the March quarter at an average price of $39. About half of these purchases were in January at a price of $43 per share. The other half of these purchases were in February and March at an average price of $35 per share. Since July 1, with the inception of WestRock, we've repurchased 11.2 million shares, and we've returned $856 million in capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In the corrugated industry, domestic end-use markets are flat to slightly up. Operating rates have continued to be in the mid-90s with declining inventories overall, and we're headed into the seasonally stronger time of the year. 
Our Corrugated Packaging business continues to improve with good operational and commercial execution. E-commerce, dairy and produce markets were strong for us in the quarter, with some softness in beverage, retail and bakery. 
Corrugated Packaging net sales in the quarter were $1.9 billion with EBITDA of $316 million. North American corrugated EBITDA margins of 17.5% increased by 20 basis points over the prior year. Total segment shipments in the quarter were 2.2 million tons, an increase of 5% over last year in large part to the increased kraft bag volumes at our mill in Dublin, Georgia. 
We continue to balance our supply with customer demand. The majority of the 30,000 tons of economic downtime that we took this quarter was medium downtime in January in advance of the final closure date at Uncasville. Our mills system was in balance during February and March. We've taken 35,000 tons of maintenance and economic downtime so far in April. 10,000 tons of the 35,000 has been economic downtime. 
While our shipments of containerboard to the domestic independent market declined by 8,000 tons sequentially, our average price per ton for this portfolio of sales to this market increased by between $1 and $2 per ton sequentially. This was principally due to the positive mix change where we sold an increasing proportion of liner and white top liner.
Export demand remained solid, although pricing remains very competitive due to the strength of the U.S. dollar and the availability of supply from Brazil, Russia and Finland. We exported 304,000 tons, 18,000 tons more than last year, while our mix of export business was consistent with 62% going to Latin America and the rest going to a combination of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our portfolio of export pricing declined $43 per ton compared to last year and was down $18 per ton sequentially. 
Turning to our North American box business. Our box pricing was stable, both compared to last year and sequentially. Our domestic box shipments were slightly up on an absolute basis and down 1% on a same-day basis as compared to last year. Last year was a very strong quarter for WestRock and is, therefore, a very tough comparison. We're experiencing similar pricing and volume trends so far this quarter. 
We feel good about the demand environment and see positive momentum with the commercial opportunities we have and how we're competing and winning in the marketplace. We're improving operationally as a result of our productivity programs and our ongoing capital investment to upgrade our capabilities. 
We're now installing the 21st of 30 EVOLs, a project that started 2 years ago that we expect to complete by the middle of fiscal year '17. We've grown our volumes in excess of the industry in 13 of the last 15 months and continue to be confident in our ability to profitably grow our box business. 
In Brazil, our performance remained strong despite challenges the country is facing. Our combined corrugated box and container board shipments increased by 13%. We're capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export linerboard to offset the impact of a contracting domestic box market. 
Now turning to our Consumer Packaging business. Favorable financial performance year-over-year was driven by strong operational and commercial performance, and we continue to realize merger synergy benefits. 
Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.6 billion and EBITDA was $224 million, up from the $181 million in the prior year quarter. We delivered $58 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress that we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements available to us. 
Industry backlogs for all of our consumer board grades stabilized during the quarter. We exited the quarter with backlogs ranging from 2 to 4 weeks, and are now moving from the 3- to 5-week range.
In SBS, our shipments increase 50,000 tons in the second quarter. This was fueled by solid growth in tobacco, food service, the on-boarding of the Carolina brand business and additional internal demand from our folding carton plants. 
Tobacco. We're continuing to have success in business development with China premium tobacco brands. We see solid growth in food service cup, driven by the ongoing conversion of foam cups to more sustainable paper cups. 
In commercial print, we are successful in working with our merchant partners to capitalize on the strength of our expanded offering of SBS for commercial print. This offering now includes both the Carolina and Tango brands. We're pleased with the integration of the Carolina brand, and we manufactured 12,000 tons of this product in the quarter. We expect the Carolina tons that we manufacture to increase to an annual rate in excess of 150,000 tons during the June quarter. 
Our Covington and Demopolis mills performed so well that we needed to balance supply with demand in our SBS system. As a result, we produced 31,000 tons more pulp, primarily at Evadale. Pulp prices were $73 per ton lower than last year. This is reflected in the pulp price/mix shown on the bridge. 
More broadly, in the paperboard markets, we're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian competitors. Pricing was stable in our core markets, with some discounting in more commodity portions of the food service plate and folding carton markets. The recent published price reductions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp & Paper Week will have limited impact in fiscal year '16. This limited impact is reflected in our cash flow guidance. 
The SBS price decrease applies only to general folding carton markets to less than 50% of our total SBS volume. The folding carton markets remained challenged by soft primary demand for processed, frozen and dry foods. This is consistent with the ongoing consumer preference for fresh foods and the shrinking center of the supermarket. With this backdrop, our folding carton team performed exceedingly well during the quarter and is benefiting from our differentiated strategy. 
We're now on-boarding new folding customers that were previously only box customers of WestRock, and we've secured new business for our SBS, CRB and CNK systems. Folding carton volumes grew by 6% in the quarter and 2% excluding the impact of the Cenveo acquisition. Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. The business is performing at expectations.
In our beverage business we've achieved gains in global beer and sparkling water markets that offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand, primarily in North America. We are growing with customers that have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multipacks in Latin America and China. 
Home, health and beauty had a very strong quarter, with EBITDA margins of more than 18%, driven by positive sales mix, especially in Europe, continued cost focus and a record productivity quarter for the business. 
In merchandising displays, customer promotional activity has stabilized, and we're entering a seasonally stronger time of the year. We're taking action to balance our capacity with current market demand, which will improve our cost structure and improve our margins. We have tremendous capabilities in our display business, and over the past several months, we've received 31 industry awards for work we performed to support companies such as: Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate, Coca-Cola and Newell Brands. 
We're nearing completion of our review of our Land and Development portfolio. Working with the team in Charleston, we've accelerated the monetization of some projects. That's reflected in a significant increase in our sales under contract figures. 
The original plan for this year had modestly negative cash flows and current plans have positive pretax cash flows for the year. We'll share more detail with you in the upcoming quarters on our progress in monetizing specific projects within our portfolio. 
The separation of Ingevity is expected to occur on May 15. The Ingevity management team, led by Michael Wilson, will be on their equity road show over the next 2 weeks. As part of the separation, WestRock will receive a distribution of $518 million and retain approximately $438 million in cash after expenses that we can use for general corporate purchases -- purposes. Ingevity has the right team and strategy in place. I'm looking forward to following Ingevity's successes as an independent company.
As a result of the separation, WestRock's Credit Agreement EBITDA will decline by the amount generated by Ingevity or about $200 million in EBITDA on a trailing basis. After adjusting for this, WestRock's leverage ratio post separation will be in the 2.35 to 2.4x range, within our target. 
We've outlined WestRock's results for the quarter both with and without Ingevity, and these numbers should help you in your modeling. Ingevity contributed $0.08 in adjusted EPS in the quarter. The June 2016 quarter, will reflect the 6 weeks of Ingevity operations as discontinued operations.
We closed on our new joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Gondi on April 1. We believe that Gondi is the premier operator in the market. Based on their recent performance, we expect the joint venture to generate annual sales of more than $750 million and EBITDA margins in excess of 20%. We're currently supplying the joint venture with containerboard at a rate of 250,000 tons per year. Importantly, the $175 million that we've contributed to the joint venture will remain in the joint venture and be available to support its growth. As an example, Gondi has just started production on a new state-of-the-art 120,000-metric-ton box plant in Nava. This plant is adjacent to the new Constellation Brands brewery. This joint venture accelerates our ability to win in the growing Mexican packaging market and gives both WestRock and Gondi many new growth opportunities. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ward."

We exited the March quarter with an annualized run rate of savings of $350 million. We continue to realize procurement and logistics savings, and the expanded scale we now have enables us to be more efficient overall. We can balance our system over this larger footprint, producing the right products in the right locations to better serve our customers and maximize efficiency.
In addition, work is continuing to streamline our businesses and corporate functions across our company. We expect to be in the $450 million to $500 million run rate range by this September, and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of FY '18. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased $29 million due primarily to the $103 million in productivity, commodity input cost deflation of $37 million and the flow-through of these into our businesses. The negative pulp price and mix impact across our corrugated and consumer businesses was $23 million. Natural gas was the biggest input cost savings area with $21 million in lower cost compared to the prior year. 
Lower chemicals, freight, diesel, wood, fiber and other costs contributed an additional $16 million to income. The reduction in pension income is a noncash charge that negatively affects earnings. 
Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our cash flow, outlook and assumptions. We are maintaining our cash flow guidance for FY '16 of $950 million to $1 billion. As we think about our business for the third quarter, there are several key items to help you with your modeling. As a starting point. Our March adjusted EPS of $0.61 includes $0.08 of Ingevity. Using that adjusted base and looking sequentially, you should consider some of the following trends that will affect our earnings in the June quarter: we expect to see some seasonal volume increases, with negative price and mix across our businesses related to export markets and the PPW changes in both corrugated and consumer grades; we anticipate price inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas and recycled fiber; our book tax rates are expected to be in the range of 34% to 36%. Net of any contribution from Ingevity, we expect an increase in adjusted earnings per share in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. 
I will now turn the call back over to Steve."

Then on SBS, I didn't include it in the comments, but like about half of our volumes would be affected by PPW that would go to the pulp and paper [ph] markets, and the other half would be just much less sensitive to that.

So first of all, I couldn't be more excited about how our Corrugated Packaging business is operating. Just made tremendous improvement from a culture and quality service innovation and satisfying our customers, which really is the foundation of the wins that we've been seeing. Really proud of the team. And that's allowed us to equal or exceed the industry performance in 13 out of the last 15 months. However, comps are getting a little tougher. The second quarter of '15, we were up 6.5% on a per-day basis. So this past quarter, we were virtually flat on an absolute basis -- or up slightly, that is, and down slightly on a per-day basis. So that is a little bit behind the industry. But we're -- we've got a very strong pipeline of new opportunities, and we would expect to see some seasonal strengthening as we go into Q3. And so therefore, we would expect to be relatively flat with another difficult quarter last year because we were up 4.5%. And -- but I think the climate is improving, and I'm confident in our team's ability to drive innovation and wins for our customers."

So there's more to it than price. On the other hand, we certainly acknowledge that prices have become incredibly competitive, largely due to a new machine startup in Northern Europe and the Russian and Brazilian economies, which is taking board produced in those countries that aren't being cut up in boxes in those countries. We're seeing that in other parts of the world. And with the currency differential they have over the U.S. dollar, it has put a significant impact on price. So to your question of, is it getting better? We have seen some currency strengthening. So we would expect that to contribute to the pricing scenario.

Because I think in your prepared remarks, you'd talked about the number of months that you'd outgrown the industry, but my question is really around, how does adding the EVOL machines change your mix of business? I mean, I would think it would move towards more longer-run businesses or longer-run boxes, but maybe it frees up those other machines that you have to do more customized work. But any color you can give around that would be appreciated."

For those of you have not yet met Matt, Matt joined WestRock in May. He has 10 years of Investor Relations experience. I'm very happy Matt decided to join our team here at WestRock. I want to st",2044,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call. 
For those of you have not yet met Matt, Matt joined WestRock in May. He has 10 years of Investor Relations experience. I'm very happy Matt decided to join our team here at WestRock. 
I want to start by taking a moment to look back on the first year of WestRock. It's been an exciting year, one that has had many accomplishments. The mergers gone extremely well and now, at year-end, I'm pleased to report we've locked together a great team, created a great company with the size and scale to succeed in the marketplace and deliver attractive and increasing cash flows to investors. WestRock holds the #1 or 2 market share position in attractive packaging markets while providing differentiated packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace and our broad portfolio of products and services is resonating well with customers. 
We're delivering expectations that we outlined at the outset of the merger. These expectations fall into 3 overall categories: Cash flow, productivity and the use of our balanced capital allocation strategy to create long-term value. 
Beginning with cash flow. We managed our business to maximize our long-term cash flow returns and we executed well on this objective during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $532 million with $106 million coming from the reduction of inventory in our corrugated and consumer packaging businesses. We expect that our full year fiscal 2016 adjusted free cash flow will exceed $1 billion. 
This was the upper end of our previously stated guidance. This highlights the strength of our business model, the capabilities of our team, our leadership position in the marketplace. It's worth pointing out that WestRock's stock continues to provide an attractive free cash flow yield of nearly 10% at the current share price. 
Next, productivity. Improving productivity allows us to mobilize our organization, getting literally hundreds of products to fund and completed. WestRock's teams are getting a lot done to improve productivity. This is demonstrated by the $105 million of productivity benefits realized in our quarterly earnings in our annual -- in our current annual run rate of synergies and performance improvements of $425 million. 
Our balanced capital allocation strategy includes paying an attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing acquisitions that improve our business and repurchasing WestRock shares, all while keeping leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x EBITDA. 
Over the past year, in addition to the 1 billion we returned to stockholders, we invested 1.4 billion back into our business through more than 800 million in capital expenditures and approximately 600 million in acquisitions, including our joint venture with Grupo Gondi. 
This quarter, we successfully completed the separation of Ingevity. I'm pleased to see the stock perform well. WestRock shareholders who held on to their Ingevity stock have over $6 per WestRock equivalent share of additional value.  All told, we're executing well on our strategy and this is reflected in our results for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we performed well across our businesses. Sales for the June quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $611 million or 17.3% of sales, driven by strong capture of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved by 190 basis points in the Consumer Packaging segment versus the prior year. 
And we generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the quarter. This brings our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow to slightly more than $800 million. 
And then how about this, over the last 12 months, we achieved more than $350 million in productivity benefits that positively impacted our income statement and cash flow. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.33x. This is within our targeted range. We repurchased 1.2 million shares in the quarter, bringing the total to 12.5 million shares, almost 5% the outstanding shares over the past 12 months. 
For Corrugated Packaging team executed very well in the quarter, with North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.3%. This is an increase of 80 basis points sequentially. 
Our North American box shipments declined by 2% on a per day basis from the very strong prior year quarter. The fiscal year-to-date box shipments had an increase over the last year. 
And in July, our box volumes have increased 1.7% on a per day basis over last year. 
Our backlogs are higher than last year, and I'm very encouraged by our new business pipeline that's up significantly over last year and as a leading indicator of volume growth. 
Our box prices declined $16 per ton from the prior year period as a result of the previously published Pulp & Paper Week containerboard price declines.  Sequentially, third quarter box pricing declined by only $6 per ton. 
Shipments of domestic containerboard were about the same as last year, they are up slightly sequentially. Prices of domestic containerboard were flat sequentially. 
Current North American containerboard markets are healthy, with industry operating rates at 95.6%. Industry daily box shipments increased by 1.5% in June over the prior year. Containerboard consumption increased 2.4% in June and industry inventory levels declined and are now down to 4 weeks of supply. 
Shipments of export containerboard decreased slightly from the prior year and increased slightly sequentially. Our mix of export business is unchanged with approximately 60% in Latin America and the rest split between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  Export pricing declined only $2 per ton sequentially. 
The negative price mix across our box, domestic independent and export customers had a pretax impact of $41 million in the quarter as compared to last year. This unfavorable impact was directly offset by ongoing productivity improvement efforts. 
Sequential changes in pricing and mix reduced income by less than $15 million, which reflect very favorably on our disciplined approach to the market. 
We balanced our supply with our market demand by taking 72,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter. 
In addition, we took 60,000 tons of maintenance downtime. 
The joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the premier operator in Mexico, is now complete. As a reminder, we hold 25% ownership interest in the partnership. Their exceptional team and exceptional assets provide us with a growth platform in a very attractive market. 
In the quarter, we shipped 67,000 tons of containerboard to the joint venture. We anticipate our shipments into Mexico will increase going forward, both from additional integration opportunities as well as from strong growth opportunities. 
When reporting Gondi's result equity investment line on statement. For the 3 months in the June quarter, Gondi's sales were $188 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. I would encourage you for the purpose of valuation to include our share of their EBITDA at an appropriate multiple. 
Based on our independent purchase price valuation as of the time of formation of the joint venture, this was an excess of $1 per share for WestRock's interest. 
Gondi's management is led by Eduardo Posada [indiscernible] to deploy additional capital available to them as a result of the joint venture. This includes the announcement of the acquisition of [indiscernible] carton business and the order of 11 new production lines from Boxton VHS that will used to upgrade existing Gondi plants and capitalize new plants. 
In Brazil, our performance remained strong despite the continued challenges the country faces. With EBITDA margins of almost 23%, our combined corrugated box and containerboard shipments increased by 5% compared to the prior year. 
Our year-to-date box volumes are tracking in the industry, down 2.3%, and we're implementing price increases to mitigate input cost inflation. 
The Três Barras mill is running well, and we are capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export linerboard to offset the impact of the soft domestic box market. 
As we indicated on our last call, we expect inflation in natural gas recycled fiber prices during the third quarter to begin to have an impact. This played out as we anticipated as seen in recycled cardboard prices, which were higher by $7 per ton. 
An increase in natural gas prices started to impact us this fourth quarter. The prices are still down as compared to last year. The average NYMEX natural gas price for the third quarter was $1.95, lower than the current strip of $2.82 for the second half of the calendar year. 
Overall, the Corrugated Packaging team navigated the market extremely well, offsetting price with productivity improvements and aggressively executing our commercial strategy. 
I'll now turn to our consumer packaging business. We drove meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points from the prior year period. This was on solid productivity and integration synergies. 
Consumer packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.64 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $275 million. 
We're in process of integrating 250,000 tons per year in SBS volumes from both internalized consumption in the Carolina business. 
Pricing was stable in our core markets in the quarter as the published price reductions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp & Paper Week had limited impact on our results at this point given our differentiated strategy portfolio and mix. 
We delivered $59 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress we're making in integrating our consumer packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements across our expanded platform. 
Demands have been stable in our folding carton and beverage packaging rates as well as in our merchandising displays, home, health and beauty groups. 
In our consumer mills, industry backlogs improved during the second half of the quarter, particularly in SBS where we're now above prior year levels. We're entering the quarter with backlog of 5% -- of 5 weeks. 
Of note, we're continuing to see solid demand growth in hot and cold drink cups. In SBS, we're seeing limited penetration at this point from European and Asian competitors. CRB is the softest grade due to continuing pressures in the packaged food categories such as cereals, crackers and snacks. Our backlogs for CRB and CNK ranged from 2 to 3 weeks. 
Beverage had a strong quarter, posting improvements and profitability versus prior year due to productivity. We continue to achieve gains in global beer and sparkling water markets, which offset the continued weakness traditional carbonated software demand primarily in North America. 
We continue to grow with customers to have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multi-packs in Latin America and China. 
Our folding carton team performed very well in the quarter and it's executing our differentiated strategy. Organic sales growth was up slightly as compared to a slight decline for the overall folding carton industry. 
Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. As part of the integration, we announced the closure of a former Cenveo facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This closure as well as the internalization of mill tons is driving $12 million of current run rate synergies. We're projecting $17 million of total synergies associated with the Cenveo transaction, that's $10 million more than originally projected. 
Using the acquisition price of $98 million, we paid 3x EBITDA after synergies. This is a terrific transaction for WestRock. 
Home, health and beauty result significantly exceeded the prior year, driven by strong sales execution on growth and mix improvement initiatives, cost-containment and operating productivity. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter add had a record for the business and were several hundred basis points higher than prior year. 
Revenue was 4% higher than prior year due to growth in North America, Europe and Brazil. 
In merchandising display, customer promotional activity has stabilized. We're seeing year-over-year growth with many of our customers. Our cost actions had a positive impact on results. We're  seeing sequential adjusted EBITDA improvement the last 2 quarters. 
As part of our long-term strategy to balance capacity and investment with market demand, we announced the closure of our Chicago manufacturing facility in April. We anticipate the cost savings of that closure to have a positive impact in fiscal year '17. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ward's. He'll talk about the progress we're making with our land and development business, our synergy capture and other financial topics. Ward?"

We made significant progress this quarter and completed a detailed review of projects and strategy within our land and development portfolio. 
Segment sales for the period were $42 million and segment income was $10 million. We accelerated the sale of the property Wallwork property and the $27 million in proceeds was more than expected. 
We have been engaged since January with our Charleston-based team and an outside real estate adviser on a project by project review to determine the best path forward to maximize value, accelerate cash flows, reduce development cost and risk. 
We now expect to complete the accelerated monetization of the portfolio within the next 24 to 30 months and realized grow sales proceeds of approximately $600 million. After distributing our partners ownership interest and paying off project-specific debt, we expect to realize after-tax cash flows of approximately $275 million to $300 million, in line with original purchase price estimates. 
More than half of this cash flow should be realized by the end of fiscal 2017. The original book value in the merger accounting was approximately $400 million on a pretax basis. 
As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy in performance improvement objectives. We exited the June quarter with an annual run rate of $425 million. We have generated benefits from the optimization of our consumer mill system, including the internalization of the Carolina tons and the outside bleach for purchases for our folding carton operations. 
In addition, we are realizing savings from our footprint actions in both business segments. We continue to make capital investments that reduced costs such as our EVOL deployment and press upgrades in our converting operations. 
WestRock's size and scale has led to sourcing benefits across overall material purchases. We expect to achieve a $500 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year, which is the upper end of our previously range, and we remain on track to achieve our billion dollar goal by the end of fiscal 2018. 
Adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $23 million. We had a $20 million unfavorable volume decline primarily within consumer packaging. The $39 million unfavorable impact of price and mix was due primarily to our corrugated business. However, we benefited from commodity deflation as lower natural gas and wood prices more than offset increased result of fiber cost. Labor cost inflation more than offset this slower energy and material cost. 
We remain committed to our ongoing productivity initiatives and expect them to continue to contribute meaningfully going forward. The small FX impact of only $4 million reflects primarily U.S. dollar revenue base. 
And finally, pension income was lower by $18 million, a noncash impact reflecting our successful pension de-risking plan. 
I'm pleased with the strong cash flow we generated through the third quarter, which gives us confidence to say we will exceed our billion-dollar adjusted free cash flow target for the fiscal 2016. 
We are a company that generates strong cash flow, and believe this metric is important when valuing WestRock. 
Some of the key business drivers for the fourth quarter are as follows: First, we anticipate inflation of input cost, including natural gas and recycled fiber, and we are planning major maintenance outages with our consumer packaging mill system that will have approximately $11 million pretax income. 
Additionally, we recognized a $10 million pretax benefit during Q3 from our Wallwork land sale, which sold for more than its step up value. We do not expect to repeat these gains in the fourth quarter and expect a sequential $10 million decline in land and development earnings. However, while these items will result in a sequential decline in adjusted earnings per share, we continue to work aggressively to capture commercial opportunities, while controlling costs. We have protected our significant overfunded status in our U.S. pension plans and that has paid off. We matched our investment strategy with our pension liability so the decline in interest rates has no impact on our overfunded status is our assets and liabilities move in tandem. We were overfunded by 107% against our GAAP liability, which translated to a $450 million over funding as of July 15.  We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan. 
Steve, I'll hand it back over to you for closing comments."

We expect to invest $800 million to $825 million during this fiscal year. This includes the Japanese funding prior to the separation. 
While we completed our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. We estimate our annual maintenance capital needs to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. 
We see numerous attractive return generating opportunities providing between 15% and 25% unlevered after-tax returns on these investments. 
So over the past year, we've returned $1 billion or more than 40% to 2.4 billion stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of capital to stock holders will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. 
We continue to see acquisitions as an important growth driver for WestRock. We have a proven core competency in making good acquisitions and driving fantastic results firm. 
This is an exciting time for WestRock. I want to thank all of our WestRock coworkers that worked to achieve all that we could accomplish in the first year. 
If you look back, our accomplishments in the first year are significant. We have successfully integrated company, both culturally and operationally. We delivered more than $350 million in productivity benefits. We separated Ingevity, completed 2 acquisitions and formed our partnership with Gondi. That's just a partial list because most importantly, we're building WestRock for the future. We're investing in developing team commercial and operational capabilities that will support our teams as we build upon our accomplishments.

I think we like our position. The logistics network and our supply chain capabilities have improved dramatically, rail cart availability, truck freight availability, I think leads us to the point where we pleased currently. There will always be some pluses and minuses and maybe over time, a small incremental further reduction. So I hope that gives you color on that front. On the cost, there's no question that we're facing some headwinds on natural gas and fiber, and you have normal inflation. However, we also have a nice pipeline of productivity.

We do not focus on, call it, quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month changes in our volumes. I know the investment community does, so we in turn have to focus on it. But I think we're focusing on building a company that is very profitable and generates long-term cash flows. So we are very focused in container, but we have a very structured way to go to market. So if you come to work at WestRock, you go through certain training, and you go to market in a very consistent way and then we're in the process of say rolling that out, broader -- more fully across WestRock, and we're in a position to do that. And I just came across something that Gallup, they have an email that they send out periodically that covers just all sorts of different topics. They sent one out yesterday and their conclusion was, they find most companies can double their revenue by simply selling more to the existing customer base. And I just repeat that because that's really on point to what we're doing. So most of our customers will buy folded carton to buy boxes, and we're taking sales force, and we're going to market to identify those customers we can go to and have value to team. And so I think that's a long-winded answer to your question, but I'm very pleased with what we're doing, and we're building that capability over the long term and our volumes will go up or down from quarter-to-quarter, but I think if you look at the overall portfolio of business we're generating, it's a very attractive portfolio of business. And I think I'm going to go on because we're supplementing that with capital. And so just for -- in container, I think we've been very clear about the investment we're doing with respect to the EVOLs. And as far as our capital budget process I talked about earlier, we go back and look at our all our capitals as to whether it does what we thought it was going to do, at least in container, as far this process, we will be at $80 million in capital projects in our box business and a lot of them are EVOLs. There were other projects as well. That actual was within 1% of what we thought it was going to be. The actual returns, we estimate it at 15% after tax. The actuals were 20%. So they were well in excess of what we thought whether we made the investment. So we have for us our business to go to market in a way which is very different for us and then back that up with the investment in capital and talent to make the business, I think we'll create a lot value in the long term by doing that."

We had pricing changes in the marketplace, we had inflationary pressures. If I were to give you the reference point of what -- why we're going to generate that the higher cash flow come out the higher end of the range, I think earnings are better. I think our working capital source that we talked about it at that point in time is actually lower. The other cash items such as cash taxes, I think they're very consistent with the assumption that we laid out back in earlier in the year and then CapEx is clearly on the lower end of the range that we had identified at the beginning of the year. I think we'll even come in just below the $825 million that we have described.

For those of you who have not yet met Matt, Matt joined WestRock in May. He has 10 years of Investor Relations experience. I'm very happy Matt's decided to join our team here at WestRock. I want",2057,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call. 
For those of you who have not yet met Matt, Matt joined WestRock in May. He has 10 years of Investor Relations experience. I'm very happy Matt's decided to join our team here at WestRock. 
I want to start by taking a moment to look back on the first year of WestRock. It's been an exciting year, one that has had many accomplishments. The merger has gone extremely well and now, at year-end, I'm pleased to report we've brought together a great team, created a great company with the size and scale to succeed in the marketplace and deliver attractive and increasing cash flows to investors. WestRock holds the #1 or 2 market share positions in attractive packaging markets while providing differentiated packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace, and our broad portfolio of products and services is resonating well with customers. 
We're delivering on the expectations that we outlined at the outset of the merger. These expectations fall into 3 overall categories: cash flow, productivity and the use of our balanced capital allocation strategy to create long-term value. 
Beginning with cash flow. We manage our business to maximize our long-term cash flow returns and we executed well on this objective during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $532 million with $106 million coming from the reduction of inventory in our Corrugated and Consumer Packaging businesses. We expect that our full year fiscal 2016 adjusted free cash flow will exceed $1 billion. 
This was the upper end of our previously stated guidance. This highlights the strength of our business model, the capabilities of our team, our leadership position in the marketplace. It's worth pointing out that WestRock's stock continues to provide an attractive free cash flow yield of nearly 10% at the current share price. 
Next, productivity. Improving productivity requires us to mobilize our organization, getting literally hundreds of products defined and completed. WestRock's teams are getting a lot done to improve productivity. This is demonstrated by the $105 million of productivity benefits realized in our quarterly earnings and our annual, current annual run rate of synergies and performance improvements of $425 million. 
Our balanced capital allocation strategy includes paying an attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing acquisitions that improve our business and repurchasing WestRock shares, all while keeping leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x EBITDA. 
Over the past year, in addition to the $1 billion we returned to stockholders, we invested $1.4 billion back into our business through more than $800 million in capital expenditures and approximately $600 million in acquisitions, including our joint venture with Grupo Gondi. 
This quarter, we successfully completed the separation of Ingevity. I'm pleased to see the stock perform well. WestRock shareholders who have held on to their Ingevity stock have over $6 per WestRock equivalent share of additional value. All told, we're executing well on our strategy and this is reflected in our results for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we performed well across our businesses. Sales for the June quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $611 million or 17.3% of sales, driven by strong capture of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved by 190 basis points in the Consumer Packaging segment versus the prior year. 
And we generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the quarter. This brings our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow to slightly more than $800 million. 
And then how about this, over the last 12 months, we achieved more than $350 million in productivity benefits that positively impacted our income statement and cash flow. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.33x. This is within our targeted range. We repurchased 1.2 million shares in the quarter, bringing the total to 12.5 million shares, almost 5% the outstanding shares over the past 12 months. 
Our Corrugated Packaging team executed very well in the quarter, with North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.3%. This is an increase of 80 basis points sequentially. 
Our North American box shipments declined by 2% on a per day basis from the very strong prior year quarter. Our fiscal year-to-date box shipments have increased over the last year. And in July, our box volumes have increased 1.7% on a per day basis over last year. 
Our backlogs are higher than last year, and I'm very encouraged by our new business pipeline that's up significantly over last year and as a leading indicator of volume growth. 
Our box prices declined $16 per ton from the prior year period as a result of the previously published Pulp & Paper Week containerboard price declines. Sequentially, third quarter box pricing declined by only $6 per ton. 
Shipments of domestic containerboard were about the same as last year, they are up slightly sequentially. Prices of domestic containerboard were flat sequentially. 
Current North American containerboard markets are healthy, with industry operating rates 95.6%. Industry daily box shipments increased by 1.5% in June over the prior year. Containerboard consumption increased 2.4% in June and industry inventory levels declined and are now down to 4 weeks of supply. 
Shipments of export containerboard decreased slightly from the prior year and increased slightly sequentially. Our mix of export business was unchanged with approximately 60% to Latin America and the rest split between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  Export pricing declined only $2 per ton sequentially. 
The negative price mix across our box, domestic independent and export customers had a pretax impact of $41 million in the quarter as compared to last year. This unfavorable impact was directly offset by ongoing productivity improvement efforts. 
Sequential changes in pricing and mix reduced income by less than $15 million, which reflect very favorably on our disciplined approach to the market. 
We balanced our supply with our market demand by taking 72,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter. 
In addition, we took 60,000 tons of maintenance downtime. 
The joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the premier operator in Mexico, is now complete. As a reminder, we hold 25% ownership interest in the partnership. Their exceptional team and exceptional assets provide us with a growth platform in a very attractive market. 
In the quarter, we shipped 67,000 tons of containerboard to the joint venture. We anticipate our shipments into Mexico will increase going forward, both from additional integration opportunities as well as from strong growth opportunities. 
We're reporting Gondi's result in the equity investment line on the income statement. For the 3 months from the June quarter, Gondi's sales were $188 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. I would encourage you, for the purpose of valuation, to include our share of their EBITDA at an appropriate multiple. Based on our independent purchase price valuation as of the time of formation of the joint venture, this was an excess of $1 per share for WestRock's interest. 
Gondi's management is led by Eduardo Posada, and they've moved quickly to deploy additional capital available to them as a result of the joint venture. This includes the announcement of the acquisition of print folding carton business and the order of 11 new production lines from Boxton VHS that will used to upgrade existing Gondi plants and capitalize new plants. 
In Brazil, our performance remained strong despite the continued challenges the country faces. With EBITDA margins of almost 23%, our combined corrugated box and containerboard shipments increased by 5% compared to the prior year. 
Our year-to-date box volumes are tracking in the industry, down 2.3%, and we're implementing price increases to mitigate input cost inflation. 
The Três Barras mill is running well, and we are capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export linerboard to offset the impact of the soft domestic box market. 
As we indicated on our last call, we expected inflation in natural gas recycled fiber prices during the third quarter to begin to have an impact. This played out as we anticipated, as seen in recycled cardboard prices, which were higher by $7 per ton. 
An increase in natural gas prices started to impact us this fourth quarter. The prices are still down as compared to last year. The average NYMEX natural gas price for the third quarter was $1.95, lower than the current strip of $2.82 for the second half of the calendar year. 
Overall, the Corrugated Packaging team navigated the market extremely well, offsetting price with productivity improvements and aggressively executing our commercial strategy. 
I'll now turn to our consumer packaging business. We drove meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points from the prior year period. This was on solid productivity and integration synergies. 
Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.64 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $275 million. 
We're in process of integrating 250,000 tons per year in SBS volumes from both internalized consumption in the Carolina business. 
Pricing was stable in our core markets in the quarter as the published price reductions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp & Paper Week had limited impact on our results at this point given our differentiated strategy portfolio and mix. 
We delivered $59 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements across our expanded platform. 
Demand has been stable in our folding carton and beverage packaging grades as well as in our merchandising displays, home, health and beauty groups. 
In our consumer mills, industry backlogs improved during the second half of the quarter, particularly in SBS where we're now above prior year levels. We're entering the quarter with backlog of 5% -- of 5 weeks. 
Of note, we're continuing to see solid demand growth in hot and cold drink cups. In SBS, we're seeing limited penetration at this point from European and Asian competitors. CRB is the softest grade due to continuing pressures in the packaged food categories such as cereals, crackers and snacks. Our backlogs for CRB and CNK range from 2 to 3 weeks. 
Beverage had a strong quarter, posting improvements and profitability versus prior year due to productivity. We continue to achieve gains in global beer and sparkling water markets, which offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand, primarily in North America. 
We continue to grow with customers to have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multipacks in Latin America and China. 
Our folding carton team performed very well in the quarter and is executing on our differentiated strategy. Organic sales growth was up slightly as compared to a slight decline for the overall folding carton industry. 
Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. As part of the integration, we announced the closure of a former Cenveo facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This closure, as well as internalization of mill tons, is driving $12 million of current run rate synergies. We're projecting $17 million of total synergies associated with the Cenveo transaction, So it's $10 million more than originally projected. Using the acquisition price of $98 million, we paid 3x EBITDA after synergies. This is a terrific transaction for WestRock. 
Home, health and beauty results significantly exceeded the prior year, driven by strong sales execution on growth and mix improvement initiatives, cost containment and operating productivity. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were at a record for the business and were several hundred basis points higher than prior year. 
Revenue was 4% higher than prior year due to growth in North America, Europe and Brazil. 
In merchandising displays, customer promotional activity has stabilized and we're seeing year-over-year growth with many of our customers. Our cost actions had a positive impact on results. We're  seeing sequential adjusted EBITDA improvement the last 2 quarters. 
As part of our long-term strategy to balance capacity and investment with market demand, we announced the closure of our Chicago manufacturing facility in April. We anticipate the cost savings of that closure to have a positive impact in fiscal year '17. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ward, who will talk about the progress we're making with our Land and Development business, our synergy capture and other financial topics. Ward?"

After distributing our partner's ownership interest and paying off project-specific debt, we expect to realize after-tax cash flows of approximately $275 million to $300 million, in line with original purchase price estimates. 
More than half of this cash flow should be realized by the end of fiscal 2017. The original book value in the merger accounting was approximately $400 million on a pretax basis. 
As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the June quarter at an annual run rate of $425 million. We have generated benefits from the optimization of our consumer mill system, including the internalization of the Carolina tons and the outside bleached board purchases for our folding carton operations. 
In addition, we are realizing savings from our footprint actions in both business segments. We continue to make capital investments that reduce costs such as our EVOL deployment and press upgrades in our converting operations. 
WestRock's size and scale has led to sourcing benefits across our raw material purchases. We expect to achieve a $500 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year, which is the upper end of our previous range, and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of fiscal 2018. 
Adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $23 million. We had a $20 million unfavorable volume decline primarily within Consumer Packaging. The $39 million unfavorable impact of price and mix was due primarily to our Corrugated business. However, we benefited from commodity deflation as lower natural gas and wood prices more than offset increased recycled fiber cost. Labor cost inflation more than offset these lower energy and material costs. 
We remain committed to our ongoing productivity initiatives and expect them to continue to contribute meaningfully going forward. The small FX impact of only $4 million reflects our primarily U.S. dollar revenue base. 
And finally, pension income was lower by $18 million, a noncash impact reflecting our successful pension derisking plan. 
I'm pleased with the strong cash flow we've generated through the third quarter, which gives us confidence to say we will exceed our $1 billion adjusted free cash flow target for the fiscal 2016. 
We are a company that generates strong cash flow and believe that this metric is important when valuing WestRock. 
Some of the key business drivers for the fourth quarter are as follows: first, we anticipate inflation of input cost, including natural gas and recycled fiber, and we are planning major maintenance outages with our Consumer Packaging mill system that will have an approximately $11 million pretax income. 
Additionally, we recognized a $10 million pretax benefit during Q3 from our Walworth land sale, which sold for more than its stepped up value. We do not expect to repeat these gains in the fourth quarter and expect a sequential $10 million decline in Land and Development earnings. However, while these items will result in a sequential decline in adjusted earnings per share, we continue to work aggressively to capture commercial opportunities, while controlling costs. We have protected our significant overfunded status in our U.S. pension plans and that has paid off. We matched our investment strategy with our pension liability so the decline in interest rates has no impact on our overfunded status as our assets and liabilities move in tandem. We were overfunded by 107% against our GAAP liability, which translated to a $450 million overfunding as of July 15.  We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan. 
Steve, I'll hand it back over to you for closing comments."

We expect to invest $800 million to $825 million during this fiscal year. This includes the Ingevity's funding prior to the separation. 
While we completed our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. We estimate our annual maintenance capital needs to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. 
We see numerous attractive return-generating opportunities providing between 15% and 25% unlevered after-tax returns on these investments. 
So over the past year, we've returned $1 billion or more than 40% to 2.4 billion stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of capital to stockholders will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. 
We continue to see acquisitions as an important growth driver for WestRock. We have a proven core competency in making good acquisitions and driving fantastic results from them. 
This is an exciting time for WestRock. I want to thank all of our WestRock coworkers that have worked to achieve all that we could accomplish in the first year. 
If you look back, our accomplishments in the first year are significant. We've successfully integrated the companies, both culturally and operationally. We delivered more than $350 million in productivity benefits. We separated Ingevity, completed 2 acquisitions and formed our partnership with Gondi. That's just a partial list because, most importantly, we're building WestRock for the future. We're investing in developing key commercial and operational capabilities that will support our teams as we build upon our accomplishments. 
WestRock provides value-added innovative paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace. And we deliver attractive and increasing cash flows for our shareholders over the long term. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready for questions."

Are you happy now in the sense of where your inventories are now down to? Do you feel like there's more reduction required? And then, I guess, flipping it around, how do you think about the industry now on a cost perspective? It would seem like even globally that we had seen costs basically moving down for the last 2, 3 years but now it looks like suddenly, they're up meaningfully especially outside the U.S. on the fiber side. And here, not only on the OCC side as well, but on that gas. Does that sort of change the way you think the business dynamics look at least next year and the year after versus what we saw in the past?"

So first of all, in our inventories, as we've -- I've shared on previous calls, we manage our inventories at a very granular level. And the whole purpose of our inventory is to make sure that we are able to provide our customers on-time delivery and using the best weight freight. Also said that coming out of our heavy outage period this past couple of quarters, we would be reducing inventories this quarter, and that's exactly what we did. Frankly, from the February peak, we were down 191,000 tons and quarter-over-quarter, 152,000. So that's a substantial drop in inventories as we said we would. Where we are currently? I think we like our position. The logistics network and our supply chain capabilities have improved dramatically. Railcar availability, truck freight availability, I think, leads us to the point where we're pretty pleased with where we are currently. There will always be some pluses and minuses and maybe over time, a small incremental further reduction. So I hope that gives you color on that front. Relative to cost, there's no question that we're facing some headwinds on natural gas and fiber and you have normal inflation. However, we also have a nice pipeline of productivity. So we think overall our cost structure in our North American containerboard mill system is one that we have opportunities to further improve. The competitiveness globally, which I think you were implying, is all currency related and certainly, we can't control that. So I hope that's germane to your question, Chip."

We do not focus on, call it, quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month changes in our volumes. I know the investment community does, so we in turn have to focus on it. But I think we're focusing on building a company that is very profitable and generates long-term cash flows. So we are very focused in container. We have just a very structured way to go to market. So if you come to work at WestRock, you're going through certain on-training, and you go to market in a very consistent way. And then we're in the process of, I'd say, rolling that out broader, more fully across WestRock, and we're in a position to do that. And I just came across something that Gallup, they have an email that they send out periodically that covers just all sorts of different topics. They sent one out yesterday and their conclusion was, they find most companies can double their revenue by simply selling more to the existing customer base. And I just repeat that because that's really on point to what we're doing. So most of our customers will buy folding carton by boxes, and we're taking sales force and we're going to market to identify those customers we can go to and have value to team. And so I think that's a long-winded answer to your question, but I'm very pleased with what we're doing, and we're building that capability over the long term. And our volumes will go up or down from quarter-to-quarter, but I think if you look at the overall portfolio of business we're generating, it's a very attractive portfolio of business. And I think I'm going to go on because we're supplementing that with capital. And so just for -- in container, I think we've been very clear about the investment we're doing with respect to the EVOLs. And as far as our capital budget process we talked about earlier, we go back and look at all of our capital as to whether it does what we thought it was going to do. At least in container, as far as this process, we reviewed $80 million in capital projects in our box business and a lot of them were EVOLs but there were other projects as well. That actual cost was within 1% of what we thought it was going to be. The actual returns, we estimate it at 15% after tax. The actuals were 20%. So they were well in excess of what we thought when we made the investment. So we have, I'll just say, a full-court press across our business to go to market in a way which is very appropriate for us and then back that up with the investment in capital and talent to make the business. I think we'll create a lot of value over the long term by doing that."

We've had pricing changes in the marketplace. We've had inflationary pressures. If I were to give you the reference points of what -- why we're going to generate the higher cash flow or come out on the higher end of the range, I think earnings are better. I think our working capital source that we talked about at that point in time is actually lower. The other cash items such as cash taxes, I think they're very consistent with the assumption that we laid out back in -- earlier in the year. And then CapEx is clearly on the lower end of the range that we had identified at the beginning of the year. I think we'll even come in just below the $825 million that we have described.

I want",2061,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call. 
For those of you who have not yet met Matt, Matt joined WestRock in May. He has 10 years of Investor Relations experience. I'm very happy Matt's decided to join our team here at WestRock. 
I want to start by taking a moment to look back on the first year of WestRock. It's been an exciting year, one that has had many accomplishments. The merger has gone extremely well and now, at year-end, I'm pleased to report we've brought together a great team, created a great company with the size and scale to succeed in the marketplace and deliver attractive and increasing cash flows to investors. WestRock holds the #1 or 2 market share positions in attractive packaging markets. We're providing differentiated packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace, and our broad portfolio of products and services is resonating well with customers. 
We're delivering on the expectations that we outlined at the outset of the merger. These expectations fall into 3 overall categories: cash flow, productivity and the use of our balanced capital allocation strategy to create long-term value. 
Beginning with cash flow. We manage our business to maximize our long-term cash flow return and we executed well on this objective during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $532 million with $106 million coming from the reduction of inventory in our Corrugated and Consumer Packaging businesses. We expect that our full year fiscal 2016 adjusted free cash flow will exceed $1 billion. 
This was the upper end of our previously stated guidance. This highlights the strength of our business model, the capabilities of our team, our leadership position in the marketplace. It's worth pointing out that WestRock's stock continues to provide an attractive free cash flow yield of nearly 10% at the current share price. 
Next, productivity. Improving productivity requires us to mobilize our organization, getting literally hundreds of products defined and completed. WestRock's teams are getting a lot done to improve productivity. This is demonstrated by the $105 million of productivity benefits realized in our quarterly earnings and our annual -- current annual run rate of synergies and performance improvements of $425 million. 
Our balanced capital allocation strategy includes paying an attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing acquisitions that improve our business and repurchasing WestRock shares, all while keeping leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x EBITDA. 
Over the past year, in addition to the $1 billion we returned to stockholders, we invested $1.4 billion back into our business through more than $800 million in capital expenditures and approximately $600 million in acquisitions, including our joint venture with Grupo Gondi. 
This quarter, we successfully completed the separation of Ingevity. I'm pleased to see the stock perform well. WestRock shareholders who have held on to their Ingevity stock have over $6 per WestRock equivalent share of additional value. All told, we're executing well on our strategy and this is reflected in our results for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we performed well across our businesses. Sales for the June quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $611 million or 17.3% of sales, driven by strong capture of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved by 190 basis points in the Consumer Packaging segment versus the prior year. 
And we generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the quarter. This brings our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow to slightly more than $800 million. 
And then how about this, over the last 12 months, we achieved more than $350 million in productivity benefits that positively impacted our income statement and cash flow. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.33x. This is within our targeted range. We repurchased 1.2 million shares in the quarter, bringing the total to 12.5 million shares, or almost 5% the outstanding shares over the past 12 months. 
Our Corrugated Packaging team executed very well in the quarter, with North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.3%. This is an increase of 80 basis points sequentially. 
Our North American box shipments declined by 2% on a per day basis from the very strong prior year quarter. Our fiscal year-to-date box shipments have increased over the last year. And in July, our box volumes have increased 1.7% on a per day basis over last year. 
Our backlogs are higher than last year, and I'm very encouraged by our new business pipeline that's up significantly over last year and is a leading indicator of volume growth. 
Our box prices declined $16 per ton from the prior year period as a result of the previously published Pulp & Paper Week containerboard price declines. Sequentially, third quarter box pricing declined by only $6 per ton. 
Shipments of domestic containerboard were about the same as last year, they are up slightly sequentially. Prices of domestic containerboard were flat sequentially. 
Current North American containerboard markets are healthy, with industry operating rates 95.6%. Industry daily box shipments increased by 1.5% in June over the prior year. Containerboard consumption increased 2.4% in June and industry inventory levels declined and are now down to 4 weeks of supply. 
Shipments of export containerboard decreased slightly from the prior year and increased slightly sequentially. Our mix of export business was unchanged with approximately 60% to Latin America and the rest split between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  Export pricing declined only $2 per ton sequentially. 
The negative price mix across our box, domestic independent and export customers had a pretax impact of $41 million in the quarter as compared to last year. This unfavorable impact was directly offset by ongoing productivity improvement efforts. 
Sequential changes in pricing and mix reduced income by less than $15 million, which reflect very favorably on our disciplined approach to the market. 
We balanced our supply with our market demand by taking 72,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter. 
In addition, we took 60,000 tons of maintenance downtime. 
The joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the premier operator in Mexico, is now complete. As a reminder, we hold 25% ownership interest in the partnership. Their exceptional team and exceptional assets provide us with a growth platform in a very attractive market. 
In the quarter, we shipped 67,000 tons of containerboard to the joint venture. We anticipate our shipments into Mexico will increase going forward, both from additional integration opportunities as well as from strong growth opportunities. 
We're reporting Gondi's result in the equity investment line on the income statement. For the 3 months from the June quarter, Gondi's sales were $188 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. I would encourage you, for the purpose of valuation, to include our share of their EBITDA at an appropriate multiple. Based on our independent purchase price valuation as of the time of formation of the joint venture, this was an excess of $1 per share for WestRock's interest. 
Gondi's management is led by Eduardo Posada, and they've moved quickly to deploy additional capital available to them as a result of the joint venture. This includes the announcement of the acquisition of [indiscernible] print folding carton business and the order of 11 new production lines from Boxton VHS [ph] that will used to upgrade existing Gondi plants and capitalize new plants. 
In Brazil, our performance remained strong despite the continued challenges the country faces. With EBITDA margins of almost 23%, our combined corrugated box and containerboard shipments increased by 5% compared to the prior year. 
Our year-to-date box volumes are tracking in the industry, down 2.3% and we're implementing price increases to mitigate input cost inflation. 
The Três Barras mill is running well, and we are capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export linerboard to offset the impact of the soft domestic box market. 
As we indicated on our last call, we expected inflation in natural gas recycled fiber prices during the third quarter to begin to have an impact. This played out as we anticipated, as seen in recycled fiber prices, which were higher by $7 per ton. 
An increase in natural gas prices started to impact us this fourth quarter, but prices are still down as compared to last year. The average NYMEX natural price for the third quarter was $1.95, lower than the current strip of $2.82 for the second half of the calendar year. 
Overall, the Corrugated Packaging team navigated the market extremely well, offsetting price with productivity improvements and aggressively executing our commercial strategy. 
I'll now turn to our consumer packaging business. We drove meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points from the prior year period. This was on solid productivity and integration synergies. 
Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.64 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $275 million. 
We're in the process of integrating 250,000 tons per year in SBS volumes from both internalized consumption and the Carolina business. 
Pricing was stable in our core markets in the quarter as the published price reductions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp & Paper Week had limited impact on our results at this point given our differentiated strategy portfolio and mix. 
We delivered $59 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements across our expanded platform. 
Demand has been stable in our folding carton and beverage packaging grades as well as in our merchandising displays, home, health and beauty groups. 
In our consumer mills, industry backlogs improved during the second half of the quarter, particularly in SBS where we're now above prior year levels. We're entering the quarter with backlogs of 5% -- of 5 weeks. 
Of note, we're continuing to see solid demand growth in hot and cold drink cups. In SBS, we're seeing limited penetration at this point from European and Asian competitors. CRB is the softest grade due to continuing pressures in the packaged food categories such as cereals, crackers and snacks. Our backlogs for CRB and CNK range from 2 to 3 weeks. 
Beverage had a strong quarter, posting improvements and profitability versus prior year due to productivity. We continue to achieve gains in global beer and sparkling water markets, which offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand, primarily in North America. 
We continue to grow with customers that have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multipacks in Latin America and China. 
Our folding carton team performed very well in the quarter and is executing on our differentiated strategy. Organic sales growth was up slightly as compared to a slight decline for the overall folding carton industry. 
Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. As part of the integration, we announced the closure of a former Cenveo facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This closure, as well as internalization of mill tons, is driving $12 million of current run rate synergies. We're projecting $17 million of total synergies associated with the Cenveo transaction, So it's $10 million more than originally projected. Using the acquisition price of $98 million, we paid 3x EBITDA after synergies. This is a terrific transaction for WestRock. 
Home, health and beauty results significantly exceeded the prior year, driven by strong sales execution on growth and mix improvement initiatives, cost containment and operating productivity. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were at a record for the business and were several hundred basis points higher than prior year. 
Revenue was 4% higher than prior year due to growth in North America, Europe and Brazil. 
In merchandising displays, customer promotional activity has stabilized and we're seeing year-over-year growth with many of our customers. Our cost actions had a positive impact on results. We're  seeing sequential adjusted EBITDA improvement the last 2 quarters. 
As part of our long-term strategy to balance capacity and investment with market demand, we announced the closure of our Chicago manufacturing facility in April. We anticipate the cost savings of that closure to have a positive impact in fiscal year '17. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ward, who will talk about the progress we're making with our Land and Development business, our synergy capture and other financial topics. Ward?"

We made significant progress this quarter and completed a detailed review of projects and strategy within our Land and Development portfolio. 
Segment sales for the period were $42 million, and segment income was $10 million. We accelerated the sale of the Walworth property and the $27 million in proceeds was more than expected. 
We have been engaged since January with our Charleston-based team and an outside real estate adviser on a project-by-project review to determine the best path forward to maximize value, accelerate cash flows, reduce development cost and risk. 
We now expect to complete the accelerated monetization of the portfolio within the next 24 to 30 months and realized gross sales proceeds of approximately $600 million. After distributing our partner's ownership interest and paying off project-specific debt, we expect to realize after-tax cash flows of approximately $275 million to $300 million, in line with original purchase price estimates. 
More than half of this cash flow should be realized by the end of fiscal 2017. The original book value in the merger accounting was approximately $400 million on a pretax basis. 
As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the June quarter at an annual run rate of $425 million. We have generated benefits from the optimization of our consumer mill system, including the internalization of the Carolina tons and the outside bleached board purchases for our folding carton operations. 
In addition, we are realizing savings from our footprint actions in both business segments. We continue to make capital investments that reduce costs such as our EVOL deployment and press upgrades in our converting operations. 
WestRock's size and scale has led to sourcing benefits across our raw material purchases. We expect to achieve a $500 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year, which is the upper end of our previous range, and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of fiscal 2018. 
Adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $23 million. We had a $20 million unfavorable volume decline primarily within Consumer Packaging. The $39 million unfavorable impact of price and mix was due primarily to our Corrugated business. However, we benefited from commodity deflation as lower natural gas and wood prices more than offset increased recycled fiber cost. Labor cost inflation more than offset these lower energy and material costs. 
We remain committed to our ongoing productivity initiatives and expect them to continue to contribute meaningfully going forward. The small FX impact of only $4 million reflects our primarily U.S. dollar revenue base. 
And finally, pension income was lower by $18 million, a noncash impact reflecting our successful pension derisking plan. 
I'm pleased with the strong cash flow we've generated through the third quarter, which gives us confidence to say we will exceed our $1 billion adjusted free cash flow target for the fiscal 2016. 
We are a company that generates strong cash flow and believe that this metric is important when valuing WestRock. 
Some of the key business drivers for the fourth quarter are as follows: first, we anticipate inflation of input cost, including natural gas and recycled fiber, and we are planning major maintenance outages with our Consumer Packaging mill system that will have an approximately $11 million pretax income. 
Additionally, we recognized a $10 million pretax benefit during Q3 from our Walworth land sale, which sold for more than its stepped up value. We do not expect to repeat these gains in the fourth quarter and expect a sequential $10 million decline in Land and Development earnings. However, while these items will result in a sequential decline in adjusted earnings per share, we continue to work aggressively to capture commercial opportunities, while controlling costs. We have protected our significant overfunded status in our U.S. pension plans and that has paid off. We matched our investment strategy with our pension liability so the decline in interest rates has no impact on our overfunded status as our assets and liabilities move in tandem. We were overfunded by 107% against our GAAP liability, which translated to a $450 million overfunding as of July 15.  We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan. 
Steve, I'll hand it back over to you for closing comments."

We expect to invest $800 million to $825 million during this fiscal year. This includes the Ingevity's funding prior to the separation. 
While we completed our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. We estimate our annual maintenance capital needs to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. 
We see numerous attractive return-generating opportunities providing between 15% and 25% unlevered after-tax returns on these investments. 
So over the past year, we've returned $1 billion or more than 40% to 2.4 billion stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of capital to stockholders will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. 
We continue to see acquisitions as an important growth driver for WestRock. We have a proven core competency in making good acquisitions and driving fantastic results from them. 
This is an exciting time for WestRock. I want to thank all of our WestRock coworkers that have worked to achieve all that we've accomplished in the first year. 
If you look back, our accomplishments in the first year are significant. We've successfully integrated the companies, both culturally and operationally. We delivered more than $350 million in productivity benefits. We separated Ingevity, completed 2 acquisitions and formed our partnership with Gondi. That's just a partial list because, most importantly, we're building WestRock for the future. We're investing in developing key commercial and operational capabilities that will support our teams as we build upon our accomplishments. 
WestRock provides value-added innovative paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace. And we deliver attractive and increasing cash flows for our shareholders over the long term.

So first of all, in our inventories, as we've -- I've shared on previous calls, we manage our inventories at a very granular level. And the whole purpose of our inventory is to make sure that we are able to provide our customers on-time delivery and using the best weight freight. Also said that coming out of our heavy outage period this past couple of quarters, we would be reducing inventories this quarter, and that's exactly what we did. Frankly, from the February peak, we were down 191,000 tons and quarter-over-quarter, 152,000. So that's a substantial drop in inventories as we said we would. Where we are currently? I think we like our position. The logistics network and our supply chain capabilities have improved dramatically. Railcar availability, truck freight availability, I think, leads us to the point where we're pretty pleased with where we are currently. There will always be some pluses and minuses and maybe over time, a small incremental further reduction. So I hope that gives you color on that front. Relative to cost, there's no question that we're facing some headwinds on natural gas and fiber and you have normal inflation. However, we also have a nice pipeline of productivity. So we think overall our cost structure in our North American containerboard mill system is one that we have opportunities to further improve. The competitiveness globally, which I think you were implying, is all currency related and certainly, we can't control that. So I hope that's germane to your question, Chip."

The forest land, the Três Barras mill, that's really state-of-the-art and our integrated packaging portfolio is a great business for us and is performing extremely well. We're all well aware of the political and economic challenges in Brazil and I don't know that I could necessarily predict the trend line going forward on that whole thing. But I would say, it will improve over time, I'm not just not sure the pace of that. Relative to our ability to compete, I think we have superior assets and the quality and capability of both our containerboard and the products coming out of our converting system are winning in the marketplace. And so as the economy improves, we're going to win. Now the beauty is we also have a very low-cost mill that's able to toggle between domestic consumption and export, so you've seen our export shipments increase over time. So net-net, I love our position in Brazil."

We do not focus on, call it, quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month changes in our volumes. I know the investment community does, so we in turn have to focus on it. But I think we're focusing on building a company that is very profitable and generates long-term cash flows. So we are very focused in container. We have just a very structured way to go to market. So if you come to work at WestRock, you're going through certain training, and you go to market in a very consistent way. And then we're in the process of, I'd say, rolling that out broader, more fully across WestRock, and we're in a position to do that. And I just came across something that Gallup, they have an email that they send out periodically that covers just all sorts of different topics. They sent one out yesterday and their conclusion was, they find most companies can double their revenue by simply selling more to the existing customer base. And I just repeat that because that's really on point to what we're doing. So most of our customers will buy folding carton; will buy boxes, and we're taking sales force and we're going to market to identify those customers we can go to and add value to. And so I think that's a long-winded answer to your question, but I'm very pleased with what we're doing, and we're building that capability over the long term. And our volumes will go up or down from quarter-to-quarter, but I think if you look at the overall portfolio of business we're generating, it's a very attractive portfolio of business. And I think I'm going to go on because we're supplementing that with capital. And so just for -- in container, I think we've been very clear about the investment we're doing with respect to the EVOLs. And as far as our capital budget process we talked about earlier, we go back and look at all of our capital as to whether it does what we thought it was going to do. At least in container, as far as this process, we reviewed $80 million in capital projects in our box business and a lot of them were EVOLs but there were other projects as well. That actual cost was within 1% of what we thought it was going to be. The actual returns, we estimated at 15% after tax. The actuals were 20%. So they were well in excess of what we thought when we made the investment. So we have, I'll just say, a full-court press across our business to go to market in a way which is very appropriate for us and then back that up with the investment in capital and talent to make the business. I think we'll create a lot of value over the long term by doing that."

So that's your reference point and stretch point. If I go back and I look at the free cash flow guidance that we gave earlier in the year, a lot of things have changed. We've had pricing changes in the marketplace. We've had inflationary pressures. If I were to give you the reference points of what -- why we're going to generate the higher cash flow or come out on the higher end of the range, I think earnings are better. I think our working capital source that we talked about at that point in time is actually lower. The other cash items such as cash taxes, I think they're very consistent with the assumption that we laid out back in -- earlier in the year. And then CapEx is clearly on the lower end of the range that we had identified at the beginning of the year. I think we'll even come in just below the $825 million that we had described. So again, I think it's earnings. Working capital is not as big of a use as we described back then. The remaining balance sheet items are fairly consistent and then lower CapEx."

I want",2062,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call. 
For those of you who have not yet met Matt, Matt joined WestRock in May. He has 10 years of Investor Relations experience. I'm very happy Matt's decided to join our team here at WestRock. 
I want to start by taking a moment to look back on the first year of WestRock. It's been an exciting year, one that has had many accomplishments. The merger has gone extremely well and now, at year-end, I'm pleased to report we've brought together a great team, created a great company with the size and scale to succeed in the marketplace and deliver attractive and increasing cash flows to investors. WestRock holds the #1 or 2 market share positions in attractive packaging markets. We're providing differentiated packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace, and our broad portfolio of products and services is resonating well with customers. 
We're delivering on the expectations that we outlined at the outset of the merger. These expectations fall into 3 overall categories: cash flow, productivity and the use of our balanced capital allocation strategy to create long-term value. 
Beginning with cash flow. We manage our business to maximize our long-term cash flow return and we executed well on this objective during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $532 million with $106 million coming from the reduction of inventory in our Corrugated and Consumer Packaging businesses. We expect that our full year fiscal 2016 adjusted free cash flow will exceed $1 billion. 
This was the upper end of our previously stated guidance. This highlights the strength of our business model, the capabilities of our team, our leadership position in the marketplace. It's worth pointing out that WestRock's stock continues to provide an attractive free cash flow yield of nearly 10% at the current share price. 
Next, productivity. Improving productivity requires us to mobilize our organization, getting literally hundreds of products defined and completed. WestRock's teams are getting a lot done to improve productivity. This is demonstrated by the $105 million of productivity benefits realized in our quarterly earnings and our annual -- current annual run rate of synergies and performance improvements of $425 million. 
Our balanced capital allocation strategy includes paying an attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing acquisitions that improve our business and repurchasing WestRock shares, all while keeping leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x EBITDA. 
Over the past year, in addition to the $1 billion we returned to stockholders, we invested $1.4 billion back into our business through more than $800 million in capital expenditures and approximately $600 million in acquisitions, including our joint venture with Grupo Gondi. 
This quarter, we successfully completed the separation of Ingevity. I'm pleased to see the stock perform well. WestRock shareholders who have held on to their Ingevity stock have over $6 per WestRock equivalent share of additional value. All told, we're executing well on our strategy and this is reflected in our results for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we performed well across our businesses. Sales for the June quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $611 million or 17.3% of sales, driven by strong capture of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved by 190 basis points in the Consumer Packaging segment versus the prior year. 
And we generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the quarter. This brings our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow to slightly more than $800 million. 
And then how about this, over the last 12 months, we achieved more than $350 million in productivity benefits that positively impacted our income statement and cash flow. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.33x. This is within our targeted range. We repurchased 1.2 million shares in the quarter, bringing the total to 12.5 million shares, or almost 5% the outstanding shares over the past 12 months. 
Our Corrugated Packaging team executed very well in the quarter, with North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.3%. This is an increase of 80 basis points sequentially. 
Our North American box shipments declined by 2% on a per day basis from the very strong prior year quarter. Our fiscal year-to-date box shipments have increased over the last year. And in July, our box volumes have increased 1.7% on a per day basis over last year. 
Our backlogs are higher than last year, and I'm very encouraged by our new business pipeline that's up significantly over last year and is a leading indicator of volume growth. 
Our box prices declined $16 per ton from the prior year period as a result of the previously published Pulp & Paper Week containerboard price declines. Sequentially, third quarter box pricing declined by only $6 per ton. 
Shipments of domestic containerboard were about the same as last year, they are up slightly sequentially. Prices of domestic containerboard were flat sequentially. 
Current North American containerboard markets are healthy, with industry operating rates 95.6%. Industry daily box shipments increased by 1.5% in June over the prior year. Containerboard consumption increased 2.4% in June and industry inventory levels declined and are now down to 4 weeks of supply. 
Shipments of export containerboard decreased slightly from the prior year and increased slightly sequentially. Our mix of export business was unchanged with approximately 60% to Latin America and the rest split between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  Export pricing declined only $2 per ton sequentially. 
The negative price mix across our box, domestic independent and export customers had a pretax impact of $41 million in the quarter as compared to last year. This unfavorable impact was directly offset by ongoing productivity improvement efforts. 
Sequential changes in pricing and mix reduced income by less than $15 million, which reflect very favorably on our disciplined approach to the market. 
We balanced our supply with our market demand by taking 72,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter. 
In addition, we took 60,000 tons of maintenance downtime. 
The joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the premier operator in Mexico, is now complete. As a reminder, we hold 25% ownership interest in the partnership. Their exceptional team and exceptional assets provide us with a growth platform in a very attractive market. 
In the quarter, we shipped 67,000 tons of containerboard to the joint venture. We anticipate our shipments into Mexico will increase going forward, both from additional integration opportunities as well as from strong growth opportunities. 
We're reporting Gondi's result in the equity investment line on the income statement. For the 3 months from the June quarter, Gondi's sales were $188 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. I would encourage you, for the purpose of valuation, to include our share of their EBITDA at an appropriate multiple. Based on our independent purchase price valuation as of the time of formation of the joint venture, this was an excess of $1 per share for WestRock's interest. 
Gondi's management is led by Eduardo Posada, and they've moved quickly to deploy additional capital available to them as a result of the joint venture. This includes the announcement of the acquisition of the Aluprint folding carton business and the order of 11 new production lines from BOBST and BHS that will used to upgrade existing Gondi plants and capitalize new plants. 
In Brazil, our performance remained strong despite the continued challenges the country faces. With EBITDA margins of almost 23%, our combined corrugated box and containerboard shipments increased by 5% compared to the prior year. 
Our year-to-date box volumes are tracking in the industry, down 2.3% and we're implementing price increases to mitigate input cost inflation. 
The Três Barras mill is running well, and we are capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export linerboard to offset the impact of the soft domestic box market. 
As we indicated on our last call, we expected inflation in natural gas recycled fiber prices during the third quarter to begin to have an impact. This played out as we anticipated, as seen in recycled fiber prices, which were higher by $7 per ton. 
An increase in natural gas prices started to impact us this fourth quarter, but prices are still down as compared to last year. The average NYMEX natural gas price for the third quarter was $1.95, lower than the current strip of $2.82 for the second half of the calendar year. 
Overall, the Corrugated Packaging team navigated the market extremely well, offsetting price with productivity improvements and aggressively executing our commercial strategy. 
I'll now turn to our consumer packaging business. We drove meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points from the prior year period. This was on solid productivity and integration synergies. 
Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.64 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $275 million. 
We're in the process of integrating 250,000 tons per year in SBS volumes from both internalized consumption and the Carolina business. 
Pricing was stable in our core markets in the quarter as the published price reductions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp & Paper Week had limited impact on our results at this point given our differentiated strategy portfolio and mix. 
We delivered $59 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements across our expanded platform. 
Demand has been stable in our folding carton and beverage packaging grades as well as in our merchandising displays, home, health and beauty groups. 
In our consumer mills, industry backlogs improved during the second half of the quarter, particularly in SBS where we're now above prior year levels. We're entering the quarter with backlogs of 5% -- of 5 weeks. 
Of note, we're continuing to see solid demand growth in hot and cold drink cups. In SBS, we're seeing limited penetration at this point from European and Asian competitors. CRB is the softest grade due to continuing pressures in the packaged food categories such as cereals, crackers and snacks. Our backlogs for CRB and CNK range from 2 to 3 weeks. 
Beverage had a strong quarter, posting improvements and profitability versus prior year due to productivity. We continue to achieve gains in global beer and sparkling water markets, which offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand, primarily in North America. 
We continue to grow with customers that have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multipacks in Latin America and China. 
Our folding carton team performed very well in the quarter and is executing on our differentiated strategy. Organic sales growth was up slightly as compared to a slight decline for the overall folding carton industry. 
Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. As part of the integration, we announced the closure of a former Cenveo facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This closure, as well as internalization of mill tons, is driving $12 million of current run rate synergies. We're projecting $17 million of total synergies associated with the Cenveo transaction, So it's $10 million more than originally projected. Using the acquisition price of $98 million, we paid 3x EBITDA after synergies. This is a terrific transaction for WestRock. 
Home, health and beauty results significantly exceeded the prior year, driven by strong sales execution on growth and mix improvement initiatives, cost containment and operating productivity. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were at a record for the business and were several hundred basis points higher than prior year. 
Revenue was 4% higher than prior year due to growth in North America, Europe and Brazil. 
In merchandising displays, customer promotional activity has stabilized and we're seeing year-over-year growth with many of our customers. Our cost actions had a positive impact on results. We're  seeing sequential adjusted EBITDA improvement the last 2 quarters. 
As part of our long-term strategy to balance capacity and investment with market demand, we announced the closure of our Chicago manufacturing facility in April. We anticipate the cost savings of that closure to have a positive impact in fiscal year '17. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ward, who will talk about the progress we're making with our Land and Development business, our synergy capture and other financial topics. Ward?"

We made significant progress this quarter and completed a detailed review of projects and strategy within our Land and Development portfolio. 
Segment sales for the period were $42 million, and segment income was $10 million. We accelerated the sale of the Walworth property and the $27 million in proceeds was more than expected. 
We have been engaged since January with our Charleston-based team and an outside real estate adviser on a project-by-project review to determine the best path forward to maximize value, accelerate cash flows, reduce development cost and risk. 
We now expect to complete the accelerated monetization of the portfolio within the next 24 to 30 months and realized gross sales proceeds of approximately $600 million. After distributing our partner's ownership interest and paying off project-specific debt, we expect to realize after-tax cash flows of approximately $275 million to $300 million, in line with original purchase price estimates. 
More than half of this cash flow should be realized by the end of fiscal 2017. The original book value in the merger accounting was approximately $400 million on a pretax basis. 
As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the June quarter at an annual run rate of $425 million. We have generated benefits from the optimization of our consumer mill system, including the internalization of the Carolina tons and the outside bleached board purchases for our folding carton operations. 
In addition, we are realizing savings from our footprint actions in both business segments. We continue to make capital investments that reduce costs such as our EVOL deployment and press upgrades in our converting operations. 
WestRock's size and scale has led to sourcing benefits across our raw material purchases. We expect to achieve a $500 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year, which is the upper end of our previous range, and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of fiscal 2018. 
Adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $23 million. We had a $20 million unfavorable volume decline primarily within Consumer Packaging. The $39 million unfavorable impact of price and mix was due primarily to our Corrugated business. However, we benefited from commodity deflation as lower natural gas and wood prices more than offset increased recycled fiber cost. Labor cost inflation more than offset these lower energy and material costs. 
We remain committed to our ongoing productivity initiatives and expect them to continue to contribute meaningfully going forward. The small FX impact of only $4 million reflects our primarily U.S. dollar revenue base. 
And finally, pension income was lower by $18 million, a noncash impact reflecting our successful pension derisking plan. 
I'm pleased with the strong cash flow we've generated through the third quarter, which gives us confidence to say we will exceed our $1 billion adjusted free cash flow target for the fiscal 2016. 
We are a company that generates strong cash flow and believe that this metric is important when valuing WestRock. 
Some of the key business drivers for the fourth quarter are as follows: first, we anticipate inflation of input cost, including natural gas and recycled fiber, and we are planning major maintenance outages with our Consumer Packaging mill system that will have an approximately $11 million pretax income. 
Additionally, we recognized a $10 million pretax benefit during Q3 from our Walworth land sale, which sold for more than its stepped up value. We do not expect to repeat these gains in the fourth quarter and expect a sequential $10 million decline in Land and Development earnings. However, while these items will result in a sequential decline in adjusted earnings per share, we continue to work aggressively to capture commercial opportunities, while controlling costs. We have protected our significant overfunded status in our U.S. pension plans and that has paid off. We matched our investment strategy with our pension liability so the decline in interest rates has no impact on our overfunded status as our assets and liabilities move in tandem. We were overfunded by 107% against our GAAP liability, which translated to a $450 million overfunding as of July 15.  We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan. 
Steve, I'll hand it back over to you for closing comments."

We've allocated $2.4 billion of capital. We've invested $841 million in capital expenditures. We expect to invest $800 million to $825 million during this fiscal year. This includes the Ingevity",323,"Thanks, Ward. Let's look back at the first year of WestRock. We've allocated $2.4 billion of capital. We've invested $841 million in capital expenditures. We expect to invest $800 million to $825 million during this fiscal year. This includes the Ingevity's funding prior to the separation. 
While we completed our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. We estimate our annual maintenance capital needs to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. 
We see numerous attractive return-generating opportunities providing between 15% and 25% unlevered after-tax returns on these investments. 
So over the past year, we've returned $1 billion or more than 40% to 2.4 billion stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of capital to stockholders will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. 
We continue to see acquisitions as an important growth driver for WestRock. We have a proven core competency in making good acquisitions and driving fantastic results from them. 
This is an exciting time for WestRock. I want to thank all of our WestRock coworkers that have worked to achieve all that we've accomplished in the first year. 
If you look back, our accomplishments in the first year are significant. We've successfully integrated the companies, both culturally and operationally. We delivered more than $350 million in productivity benefits. We separated Ingevity, completed 2 acquisitions and formed our partnership with Gondi. That's just a partial list because, most importantly, we're building WestRock for the future. We're investing in developing key commercial and operational capabilities that will support our teams as we build upon our accomplishments. 
WestRock provides value-added innovative paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace. And we deliver attractive and increasing cash flows for our shareholders over the long term. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready for questions."

So first of all, in our inventories, as we've -- I've shared on previous calls, we manage our inventories at a very granular level. And the whole purpose of our inventory is to make sure that we are able to provide our customers on-time delivery and using the best weight freight. Also said that coming out of our heavy outage period this past couple of quarters, we would be reducing inventories this quarter, and that's exactly what we did. Frankly, from the February peak, we were down 191,000 tons and quarter-over-quarter, 152,000. So that's a substantial drop in inventories as we said we would. Where we are currently? I think we like our position. The logistics network and our supply chain capabilities have improved dramatically. Railcar availability, truck freight availability, I think, leads us to the point where we're pretty pleased with where we are currently. There will always be some pluses and minuses and maybe over time, a small incremental further reduction. So I hope that gives you color on that front. Relative to cost, there's no question that we're facing some headwinds on natural gas and fiber and you have normal inflation. However, we also have a nice pipeline of productivity. So we think overall our cost structure in our North American containerboard mill system is one that we have opportunities to further improve. The competitiveness globally, which I think you were implying, is all currency related and certainly, we can't control that. So I hope that's germane to your question, Chip."

We do not focus on, call it, quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month changes in our volumes. I know the investment community does, so we in turn have to focus on it. But I think we're focusing on building a company that is very profitable and generates long-term cash flows. So we are very focused in container. We have just a very structured way to go to market. So if you come to work at WestRock, you're going through certain training, and you go to market in a very consistent way. And then we're in the process of, I'd say, rolling that out broader, more fully across WestRock, and we're in a position to do that. And I just came across something that Gallup, they have an email that they send out periodically that covers just all sorts of different topics. They sent one out yesterday and their conclusion was, they find most companies can double their revenue by simply selling more to the existing customer base. And I just repeat that because that's really on point to what we're doing. So most of our customers will buy folding carton; will buy boxes, and we're taking sales force and we're going to market to identify those customers we can go to and add value to. And so I think that's a long-winded answer to your question, but I'm very pleased with what we're doing, and we're building that capability over the long term. And our volumes will go up or down from quarter-to-quarter, but I think if you look at the overall portfolio of business we're generating, it's a very attractive portfolio of business. And I think I'm going to go on because we're supplementing that with capital. And so just for -- in container, I think we've been very clear about the investment we're doing with respect to the EVOLs. And as far as our capital budget process we talked about earlier, we go back and look at all of our capital as to whether it does what we thought it was going to do. At least in container, as far as this process, we reviewed $80 million in capital projects in our box business and a lot of them were EVOLs but there were other projects as well. That actual cost was within 1% of what we thought it was going to be. The actual returns, we estimated at 15% after tax. The actuals were 20%. So they were well in excess of what we thought when we made the investment. So we have, I'll just say, a full-court press across our business to go to market in a way which is very appropriate for us and then back that up with the investment in capital and talent to make the business. I think we'll create a lot of value over the long term by doing that."

We've had pricing changes in the marketplace. We've had inflationary pressures. If I were to give you the reference points of what -- why we're going to generate the higher cash flow or come out on the higher end of the range, I think earnings are better. I think our working capital source that we talked about at that point in time is actually lower. The other cash items such as cash taxes, I think they're very consistent with the assumption that we laid out back in -- earlier in the year. And then CapEx is clearly on the lower end of the range that we had identified at the beginning of the year. I think we'll even come in just below the $825 million that we had described.

These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. 
Additionally, we will be referencing adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The other -- slide presentation is available on our website. 
So with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve."

Thank you for joining our call today. September marked the end of our first fiscal year at WestRock. We've had an exciting and productive year. We've made considerable progress in building WestRock into what we are",1363,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. 
September marked the end of our first fiscal year at WestRock. We've had an exciting and productive year. We've made considerable progress in building WestRock into what we are today. We're a $14 billion paper and packaging company. We hold waiting positions across a board set of markets. We're providing our customers with tailor-made solutions that help them win in their markets. We're executing our strategic plan in delivering excellent results. 
After only 5 quarters, we're already halfway toward our $1 billion, 3-year synergy and performance improvement target. Over the same 5 quarters, we delivered $444 million in productivity improvements. We manage our business to sustain and grow our cash flows over the long term. 
During fiscal '16, we delivered over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. We returned $716 million to stockholders through $381 million in dividends and $335 million in share repurchases. Today, we bought back 13.5 million shares or 5% of WestRock's outstanding shares. We improved our business by investing $588 million in 2 acquisitions and 1 joint venture. Our balance sheet is in great shape with a leverage ratio of 2.33x. 
On Friday, we announced a $0.10 per share increase to our annual dividend. The dividend increase underscores our confidence in our long-term cash flows. We have ample capacity to reinvest in our existing facilities. We have the flexibility to make acquisitions that improve our business and generate attractive returns. We will continue to purchase WestRock shares and expect to hold leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x. 
Sales for the quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $589 million for a margin of 16.3%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Productivity initiatives contributed $89 million to our income during the quarter. 
We transferred $2.5 billion  of pension assets and liabilities to a third party. This transaction significantly derisk our U.S. qualified pension plan. 
For the full year, sales were $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 billion for a margin of 16%. 
We achieved our productivity and cash flow objectives in fiscal '16 when we set the stage for very successful 2017. 
The Corrugated Packaging team delivered solid results in the quarter, including North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.2%. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $31 million from the prior year and was flat sequentially. 
As we said what happened on last quarter's call, the Pulp & Paper Week price reduction from earlier this year continues to flow through this quarter. This is true for both our box and domestic containerboard businesses. 
We reduced inventory by 143,000 tons from a year ago, and we reduced inventory 16,000 tons sequentially. We took 32,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter. Most of this downtime was at our Stevenson mill, where we completed our capital project to convert to a new pulping process. This scheduled outage at the Stevenson mill reduced income by $10 million. 
We're communicated a $50 per ton price increase to our customers for domestic containerboard and Corrugated Packaging. Export pricing has improved in our largest markets, including Latin America, where pricing was up $8 per ton sequentially. Our system has been and continues to be tight with good demand, lower inventories and high operating margins.[ph] 
Within our box business, backlogs have strengthened, and our current pipeline in new business remains strong. Our differentiated strategy is earning us new business. 
In October, our box volumes were up 1.6% over last year on a daily basis. 
Turning to Hurricane Matthew. I'm pleased to report that our employees came through Hurricane Matthew with no injuries. We have had several employees and their families with damage to their homes and some of these employees are receiving support from the WestRock employee relief fund. The impact of Hurricane Matthew on our business has reduced production by 35,000 tons. We've reduced shipments to export markets to help meet our improving demand as well as address the lower production due to Hurricane Matthew. 
Grupo Gondi sales in the quarter were $180 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. We shipped 55,000 tons of container board to the Grupo Gondi joint venture and we expect shipments to increase going forward as Gondi grows its business. 
Last week, Gondi completed the acquisition of Aluprint, a leading manufacturer of folding cartons in Mexico. This acquisition has additional capabilities for Gondi to serve customers in the growing Mexican packaging market. 
In Brazil, our team performed exceptionally well despite continued regional economic challenges. Box shipments per day were up by approximately 9% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. EBITDA margins were 26.4%. Jim Porter is working with the team in Brazil and I expect that they will create attractive investment opportunities for WestRock over the next year. 
Jim continues to advise us on the North American Containerboard business as Jeff Chalovich has assumed the responsibility of waiting [ph] this business for WestRock. 
Jeff brings over 25 years of industry experience to WestRock. He joined Rock-Tenn in 2008 when we acquired Southern Container. He's been leading our $5 billion box business for the past 4 years. 
Over the same period, we've improved our North American Corrugated Packaging EBITDA margins from 13% to 18%. Jeff's leadership has driven much of this improvement, and we have more runway to increase margins. I'm looking forward to supporting our entire Corrugated Packaging team to deliver even better results through the execution of our differentiated strategy. 
Consumer packaging delivered improved earnings and margins in the quarter. Net sales were $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $268 million. We delivered $42 million in productivity improvements. This drove our 90 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins. 
Folding carton revenue grew by 10% year-over-year, driven by the Cenveo Packaging acquisition and organic growth of 2% in our core North American business. We're making good progress on productivity initiatives across our converting businesses. 
Pricing and mix were favorable, primarily due to lower pulp volumes. This was partially offset by the flow through of previously published index reductions for SBS and CRB. Our SBS backlogs have strengthened and are currently at 5 weeks. We produced less pulp at our SBS mills in the quarter. This was a result of improved paperboard demand and planned maintenance outages at the Covington and Demopolis mills. 
We're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian board suppliers that's been targeting the U.S. market. 
Finally, sequentially, both our CRB and CNK backlogs have increased and both are approximately at 3 weeks. 
Bob Feeser leads our Consumer Packaging business. Bob's career started at Mead about 30 years ago. His known converting experience includes consumer, corrugated, domestic and international assignments. Bob has his broad set of experiences as any executive at WestRock. Bob's been instrumental in delivering more than $230 million in productivity improvements in the Consumer Packaging business. 
Our Consumer Packaging business is successful implementing our differentiated strategy. I look forward to supporting the business and their drive to improve margins. 
Home, health and beauty. Our home, health and beauty business has been performing extremely well over the past few years. Fiscal '16, our sales were $567 million. EBITDA was in excess of $100 million. Capital expenditures have been less than 5% of sales. The business has generated very strong cash flows that have grown that we expect to continue to grow over the next several years. The entire home, health and beauty organization deserves recognition for what they've accomplished since the merger and many years before the merger. 
While the business has fit well with WestRock's portfolio of packaging solutions, hopefully help here as [indiscernible] home, health and beauty are valued at higher multiples in WestRock overall. And in fact, our home, health and beauty business may fit even better with another company. 
Accordingly, our board has authorized us to evaluate strategic alternatives for the home, health and beauty business. These alternatives include the potential sale of the business during the first half of calendar 2017. In the event we sold the business for cash, we expect to use the sale proceeds consistent with our balance capital allocation strategy. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward."

We are making great progress on monetizing our Brand and Development portfolio. We completed the $13 million after-tax sale of a residential apartment complex during the quarter. As discussed on our previous call, we expect to realize 0.",621,"Thank you, Steve. We are making great progress on monetizing our Brand and Development portfolio. We completed the $13 million after-tax sale of a residential apartment complex during the quarter. As discussed on our previous call, we expect to realize 0.5 of the $275 million to $300 million in net after-tax free cash flow during fiscal 2017. 
As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the September quarter at an annual run rate of $500 million. Fiscal 2016 productivity was driven by insourcing initiatives, procurement, actions to rationalize our footprint, return generating capital investments and merger-related synergies. We expect to achieve an $800 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017 and remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of fiscal 2018. 
Fourth quarter adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $27 million, driven in part by unfavorable volume, the anticipated impact of price and mix and inflation of both input cost and labor. The impact of these 3 items was nearly offset by ongoing productivity improvements. 
On a full year basis, combined company adjusted EBITDA declined by $51 million, driven by lower volume and favorable pricing mix, wage and other input cost inflation. However, we were able to offset much of these items by delivering $384 million of productivity improvements. 
In summary, both the quarter and the full fiscal year were successful. And I'd like to thank all of our employees for making this happen. 
As we look back at the first 5 quarters of WestRock, we have allocated $2.8 billion of capital. We have invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures over the last 15 months and continue to see numerous attractive return-generating opportunities. 
We returned $1.14 billion or almost half of the total to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of cash to stockholders via dividends and share buybacks will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. 
In the first quarter, we expect sequential earnings will be lower, in line with seasonal -- with the seasonal pattern we experienced last year. I'd like to remind you that from Q4 fiscal 2015 to Q1 fiscal 2016, segment income declined by $88 million. We have outlined several of the drivers of the first quarter and full year on Slide 12. 
For Q1, we anticipate that pricing mix will be negative as the impact of the previously announced corrugated price increase will be more than offset by the flow through of the previously published consumer price decreases. 
The first quarter is typically our heaviest maintenance period, and we are planning 160,000 tons of downtime. Volumes will likely declined, driven by 4 less shipping days in our Container business. Consumer grades experienced seasonal softness in the first quarter as well. Inflation of input prices will continue in the period. And finally, Hurricane Matthew will negatively impact us by approximately $15 million to $20 million. These items should lead you to a first quarter adjusted EPS lower than what we delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, but increasing steadily as we make our way through the year. 
For the full year fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion, including approximately $150 million of land and development after-tax cash flow. We expect to invest approximately $750 million in CapEx. We also expect to realize significant productivity as well as meaningful inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas, recycled fiber and certain chemicals. Both tax rates are estimated at 34% to 35%,  and cash tax rates are in the high 20s. 
Steve, I will hand it back to you for closing comments."

You're right, we do have the contribution of $150 million from land and development versus a small use from land and development in fiscal 2016. In earnings, we have modeled in the implementation of containerboard price increase. That's partially offset by the full year impact of the flow through of the previously announced PPW decreases in some of our consumer grades, along with a negative impact of input cost inflation. So if you take our current pricing for some of our key raw materials and you compare that to the average of those prices in 2016, you could easily model between $175 million and $200 million of inflation on a year-over-year basis. Our working capital and other balance sheet items include -- should be a source as we expand some of our payment terms with our vendors through our supply chain financing programs. The other thing that I would also call out is that we've got some noncash-related earnings. I think we highlighted at the equity and nonconsolidated affiliates, that's Gondi, and it's also the portion of our land and development holdings that are not -- where we don't have a consolidating interest.

And these were the highest we've seen since those times. So fundamentals are very good. Our system is extremely tight. We're having to repatriate tons out of the export market to meet our domestic demand and customers. Orders for our domestic containerboard are up and are solid, about 95,000 tons year-over-year and 24,000 tons sequentially. So we see the market fundamentals as strong and very good."

We've had a long time where they've have not had the opportunity to offset naturally rising cost like health care cost or the fact that people might get paid a little more every year. And so my question is, should we read into the announced box price increase? I think you mentioned 10% to 12%. Some opportunity to capture some of those -- the offset sort of cost increases so that if I'm an independent player, I might actually see my realizations go up more than $50 because, obviously, if I'm paying $50 more for board, I need more than that offset these other costs?"

Thank you for joining our call today. September marked the end of our first fiscal year at WestRock. We've had an exciting and productive year. We've made considerable progress in building WestRock into what we are",1363,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. 
September marked the end of our first fiscal year at WestRock. We've had an exciting and productive year. We've made considerable progress in building WestRock into what we are today. We're a $14 billion paper and packaging company. We hold waiting positions across a board set of markets. We're providing our customers with tailor-made solutions that help them win in their markets. We're executing our strategic plan in delivering excellent results. 
After only 5 quarters, we're already halfway toward our $1 billion, 3-year synergy and performance improvement target. Over the same 5 quarters, we delivered $444 million in productivity improvements. We manage our business to sustain and grow our cash flows over the long term. 
During fiscal '16, we delivered over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. We returned $716 million to stockholders through $381 million in dividends and $335 million in share repurchases. Today, we bought back 13.5 million shares or 5% of WestRock's outstanding shares. We improved our business by investing $588 million in 2 acquisitions and 1 joint venture. Our balance sheet is in great shape with a leverage ratio of 2.33x. 
On Friday, we announced a $0.10 per share increase to our annual dividend. The dividend increase underscores our confidence in our long-term cash flows. We have ample capacity to reinvest in our existing facilities. We have the flexibility to make acquisitions that improve our business and generate attractive returns. We will continue to purchase WestRock shares and expect to hold leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x. 
Sales for the quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $589 million for a margin of 16.3%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Productivity initiatives contributed $89 million to our income during the quarter. 
We transferred $2.5 billion  of pension assets and liabilities to a third party. This transaction significantly derisk our U.S. qualified pension plan. 
For the full year, sales were $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 billion for a margin of 16%. 
We achieved our productivity and cash flow objectives in fiscal '16 when we set the stage for very successful 2017. 
The Corrugated Packaging team delivered solid results in the quarter, including North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.2%. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $31 million from the prior year and was flat sequentially. 
As we said what happened on last quarter's call, the Pulp & Paper Week price reduction from earlier this year continues to flow through this quarter. This is true for both our box and domestic containerboard businesses. 
We reduced inventory by 143,000 tons from a year ago, and we reduced inventory 16,000 tons sequentially. We took 32,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter. Most of this downtime was at our Stevenson mill, where we completed our capital project to convert to a new pulping process. This scheduled outage at the Stevenson mill reduced income by $10 million. 
We're communicated a $50 per ton price increase to our customers for domestic containerboard and Corrugated Packaging. Export pricing has improved in our largest markets, including Latin America, where pricing was up $8 per ton sequentially. Our system has been and continues to be tight with good demand, lower inventories and high operating rate..
Within our box business, backlogs have strengthened, and our current pipeline in new business remains strong. Our differentiated strategy is earning us new business. 
In October, our box volumes were up 1.6% over last year on a daily basis. 
Turning to Hurricane Matthew. I'm pleased to report that our employees came through Hurricane Matthew with no injuries. We have had several employees and their families with damage to their homes and some of these employees are receiving support from the WestRock employee relief fund. The impact of Hurricane Matthew on our business has reduced production by 35,000 tons. We've reduced shipments to export markets to help meet our improving demand as well as address the lower production due to Hurricane Matthew. 
Grupo Gondi sales in the quarter were $180 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. We shipped 55,000 tons of container board to the Grupo Gondi joint venture and we expect shipments to increase going forward as Gondi grows its business. Last week, Gondi completed the acquisition of Aluprint, a leading manufacturer of folding cartons in Mexico. This acquisition has additional capabilities for Gondi to serve customers in the growing Mexican packaging market. 
In Brazil, our team performed exceptionally well despite continued regional economic challenges. Box shipments per day were up by approximately 9% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. EBITDA margins were 26.4%. Jim Porter is working with the team in Brazil and I expect that they will create attractive investment opportunities for WestRock over the next year. 
Jim continues to advise us on the North American Containerboard business as Jeff Chalovich has assumed the responsibility of leading this business for WestRock. 
Jeff brings over 25 years of industry experience to WestRock. He joined Rock-Tenn in 2008 when we acquired Southern Container. He's been leading our $5 billion box business for the past 4 years. 
Over the same period, we've improved our North American Corrugated Packaging EBITDA margins from 13% to 18%. Jeff's leadership has driven much of this improvement, and we have more runway to increase margins. I'm looking forward to supporting our entire Corrugated Packaging team to deliver even better results through the execution of our differentiated strategy. 
Consumer packaging delivered improved earnings and margins in the quarter. Net sales were $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $268 million. We delivered $42 million in productivity improvements. This drove our 90 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins. 
Folding carton revenue grew by 10% year-over-year, driven by the Cenveo Packaging acquisition and organic growth of 2% in our core North American business. We're making good progress on productivity initiatives across our converting businesses. 
Pricing and mix were favorable, primarily due to lower pulp volumes. This was partially offset by the flow through of previously published index reductions for SBS and CRB. Our SBS backlogs have strengthened and are currently at 5 weeks. We produced less pulp at our SBS mills in the quarter. This was a result of improved paperboard demand and planned maintenance outages at the Covington and Demopolis mills. 
We're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian board suppliers that's been targeting the U.S. market. 
Finally, sequentially, both our CRB and CNK backlogs have increased and both are approximately at 3 weeks. 
Bob Feeser leads our Consumer Packaging business. Bob's career started at Mead about 30 years ago. His known converting experience includes consumer, corrugated, domestic and international assignments. Bob has his broad set of experiences as any executive at WestRock. Bob's been instrumental in delivering more than $230 million in productivity improvements in the Consumer Packaging business. 
Our Consumer Packaging business is successful implementing our differentiated strategy. I look forward to supporting the business and their drive to improve margins. 
Home, health and beauty. Our home, health and beauty business has been performing extremely well over the past few years. Fiscal '16, our sales were $567 million. EBITDA was in excess of $100 million. Capital expenditures have been less than 5% of sales. The business has generated very strong cash flows that have grown that we expect to continue to grow over the next several years. The entire home, health and beauty organization deserves recognition for what they've accomplished since the merger and many years before the merger. 
While the business has fit well with WestRock's portfolio of packaging solutions, hopefully, it'll help here as [indiscernible] home, health and beauty are valued at higher multiples in WestRock overall. And in fact, our home, health and beauty business may fit even better with another company. 
Accordingly, our board has authorized us to evaluate strategic alternatives for the home, health and beauty business. These alternatives include the potential sale of the business during the first half of calendar 2017. In the event we sold the business for cash, we expect to use the sale proceeds consistent with our balance capital allocation strategy. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward."

We are making great progress on monetizing our Brand and Development portfolio. We completed the $13 million after-tax sale of a residential apartment complex during the quarter. As discussed on our previous call, we expect to realize 0.",621,"Thank you, Steve. We are making great progress on monetizing our Brand and Development portfolio. We completed the $13 million after-tax sale of a residential apartment complex during the quarter. As discussed on our previous call, we expect to realize 0.5 of the $275 million to $300 million in net after-tax free cash flow during fiscal 2017. 
As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the September quarter at an annual run rate of $500 million. Fiscal 2016 productivity was driven by insourcing initiatives, procurement, actions to rationalize our footprint, return generating capital investments and merger-related synergies. We expect to achieve an $800 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017 and remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of fiscal 2018. 
Fourth quarter adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $27 million, driven in part by unfavorable volume, the anticipated impact of price and mix and inflation of both input cost and labor. The impact of these 3 items was nearly offset by ongoing productivity improvements. 
On a full year basis, combined company adjusted EBITDA declined by $51 million, driven by lower volume and favorable pricing mix, wage and other input cost inflation. However, we were able to offset much of these items by delivering $384 million of productivity improvements. 
In summary, both the quarter and the full fiscal year were successful. And I'd like to thank all of our employees for making this happen. 
As we look back at the first 5 quarters of WestRock, we have allocated $2.8 billion of capital. We have invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures over the last 15 months and continue to see numerous attractive return-generating opportunities. 
We returned $1.14 billion or almost half of the total to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of cash to stockholders via dividends and share buybacks will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. 
In the first quarter, we expect sequential earnings will be lower, in line with seasonal -- with the seasonal pattern we experienced last year. I'd like to remind you that from Q4 fiscal 2015 to Q1 fiscal 2016, segment income declined by $88 million. We have outlined several of the drivers of the first quarter and full year on Slide 12. 
For Q1, we anticipate that pricing mix will be negative as the impact of the previously announced corrugated price increase will be more than offset by the flow through of the previously published consumer price decreases. 
The first quarter is typically our heaviest maintenance period, and we are planning 160,000 tons of downtime. Volumes will likely declined, driven by 4 less shipping days in our Container business. Consumer grades experienced seasonal softness in the first quarter as well. Inflation of input prices will continue in the period. And finally, Hurricane Matthew will negatively impact us by approximately $15 million to $20 million. These items should lead you to a first quarter adjusted EPS lower than what we delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, but increasing steadily as we make our way through the year. 
For the full year fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion, including approximately $150 million of land and development after-tax cash flow. We expect to invest approximately $750 million in CapEx. We also expect to realize significant productivity as well as meaningful inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas, recycled fiber and certain chemicals. Both tax rates are estimated at 34% to 35%, and cash tax rates are in the high 20s. 
Steve, I will hand it back to you for closing comments."

You're right, we do have the contribution of $150 million from land and development versus a small use from land and development in fiscal 2016. In earnings, we have modeled in the implementation of containerboard price increase. That's partially offset by the full year impact of the flow through of the previously announced PPW decreases in some of our consumer grades, along with a negative impact of input cost inflation. So if you take our current pricing for some of our key raw materials and you compare that to the average of those prices in 2016, you could easily model between $175 million and $200 million of inflation on a year-over-year basis. Our working capital and other balance sheet items include -- should be a source as we expand some of our payment terms with our vendors through our supply chain financing programs. The other thing that I would also call out is that we've got some noncash-related earnings.

And then a second question just looking at the industry in general. It's been almost a record period, 3.5 years since we saw corrugated prices move up in North America. And one thing I seem to recall in the past is when you've had a long period of time, unless whether it's your box plant managers looking at it on their own P&L level or your independent customers, we've had a long time where they have not had the opportunity to offset naturally rising cost like health care cost or the fact that people might get paid a little more every year. And so my question is, should we read into the announced box price increase? I think you mentioned 10% to 12%. Some opportunity to capture some of those to offset some of those cost increases, so that if I'm an independent player, I might actually see my realizations go up more than $50 because, obviously, if I'm paying $50 more for board, I need more than that to offset these other costs?"

Now with that said, the Dublin mill has added some significant flexibility for us, as we're able to go down really into the micro basis weights of 70 GSM or a 14-pound board that we do have applications for in our Corrugated business.

September marked the end of our first fiscal year at WestRock. We've had an exciting and productive year. We've made considerable progress in building WestRock into what we are today. We're a $14 billion paper and packaging company. We hold waiting positions across a board set of markets. We're providing our customers with tailor-made solutions that help them win in their markets. We're executing our strategic plan in delivering excellent results. 
After only 5 quarters, we're already halfway toward our $1 billion, 3-year synergy and performance improvement target. Over the same 5 quarters, we delivered $444 million in productivity improvements. We manage our business to sustain and grow our cash flows over the long term. 
During fiscal '16, we delivered over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. We returned $716 million to stockholders through $381 million in dividends and $335 million in share repurchases. Today, we bought back 13.5 million shares or 5% of WestRock's outstanding shares. We improved our business by investing $588 million in 2 acquisitions and 1 joint venture. Our balance sheet is in great shape with a leverage ratio of 2.33x. 
On Friday, we announced a $0.10 per share increase to our annual dividend. The dividend increase underscores our confidence in our long-term cash flows. We have ample capacity to reinvest in our existing facilities. We have the flexibility to make acquisitions that improve our business and generate attractive returns. We will continue to purchase WestRock shares and expect to hold leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5x. 
Sales for the quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $589 million for a margin of 16.3%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Productivity initiatives contributed $89 million to our income during the quarter. 
We transferred $2.5 billion  of pension assets and liabilities to a third party. This transaction significantly derisks our U.S. qualified pension plan. 
For the full year, sales were $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 billion for a margin of 16%. 
We achieved our productivity and cash flow objectives in fiscal '16 when we set the stage for very successful 2017. 
The Corrugated Packaging team delivered solid results in the quarter, including North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.2%. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $31 million from the prior year and was flat sequentially. 
As we said what happened on last quarter's call, the Pulp & Paper Week price reduction from earlier this year continues to flow through this quarter. This is true for both our box and domestic containerboard businesses. 
We reduced inventory by 143,000 tons from a year ago, and we reduced inventory 16,000 tons sequentially. We took 32,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter. Most of this downtime was at our Stevenson mill, where we completed our capital project to convert to a new pulping process. This scheduled outage at the Stevenson mill reduced income by $10 million. 
We're communicated a $50 per ton price increase to our customers for domestic containerboard and Corrugated Packaging. Export pricing has improved in our largest markets, including Latin America, where pricing was up $8 per ton sequentially. Our system has been and continues to be tight with good demand, low inventories and high operating rates.
Within our box business, backlogs have strengthened, and our current pipeline in new business remains strong. Our differentiated strategy is earning us new business. 
In October, our box volumes were up 1.6% over last year on a daily basis. 
Turning to Hurricane Matthew. I'm pleased to report that our employees came through Hurricane Matthew with no injuries. We have had several employees and their families with damage to their homes and some of these employees are receiving support from the WestRock employee relief fund. The impact of Hurricane Matthew on our business has reduced production by 35,000 tons. We've reduced shipments to export markets to help meet our improving demand as well as address the lower production due to Hurricane Matthew. 
Grupo Gondi sales in the quarter were $180 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. We shipped 55,000 tons of container board to the Grupo Gondi joint venture and we expect shipments to increase going forward as Gondi grows its business. Last week, Gondi completed the acquisition of Aluprint, a leading manufacturer of folding cartons in Mexico. This acquisition has additional capabilities for Gondi to serve customers in the growing Mexican packaging market. 
In Brazil, our team performed exceptionally well despite continued regional economic challenges. Box shipments per day were up by approximately 9% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. EBITDA margins were 26.4%. Jim Porter is working with the team in Brazil and I expect that they will create attractive investment opportunities for WestRock over the next year. 
Jim continues to advise us on the North American Containerboard business as Jeff Chalovich has assumed the responsibility of leading this business for WestRock. 
Jeff brings over 25 years of industry experience to WestRock. He joined Rock-Tenn in 2008 when we acquired Southern Container. He's been leading our $5 billion box business for the past 4 years. 
Over the same period, we've improved our North American Corrugated Packaging EBITDA margins from 13% to 18%. Jeff's leadership has driven much of this improvement, and we have more runway to increase margins. I'm looking forward to supporting our entire Corrugated Packaging team to deliver even better results through the execution of our differentiated strategy. 
Consumer packaging delivered improved earnings and margins in the quarter. Net sales were $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $268 million. We delivered $42 million in productivity improvements. This drove our 90 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins. 
Folding carton revenue grew by 10% year-over-year, driven by the Cenveo Packaging acquisition and organic growth of 2% in our core North American business. We're making good progress on productivity initiatives across our converting businesses. 
Pricing and mix were favorable, primarily due to lower pulp volumes. This was partially offset by the flow through of previously published index reductions for SBS and CRB. Our SBS backlogs have strengthened and are currently at 5 weeks. We produced less pulp at our SBS mills in the quarter. This was a result of improved paperboard demand and planned maintenance outages at the Covington and Demopolis mills. 
We're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian board suppliers that's been targeting the U.S. market. 
Finally, sequentially, both our CRB and CNK backlogs have increased and both are approximately at 3 weeks. 
Bob Feeser leads our Consumer Packaging business. Bob's career started at Mead about 30 years ago. His known converting experience includes consumer, corrugated, domestic and international assignments. Bob has as broad a set of experiences as any executive at WestRock. Bob's been instrumental in delivering more than $230 million in productivity improvements in the Consumer Packaging business. 
Our Consumer Packaging business is successful implementing our differentiated strategy. I look forward to supporting the business and their drive to improve margins. 
Home, health and beauty. Our home, health and beauty business has been performing extremely well over the past few years. Fiscal '16, our sales were $567 million. EBITDA was in excess of $100 million. Capital expenditures have been less than 5% of sales. The business has generated very strong cash flows that have grown and that we expect to continue to grow over the next several years. The entire home, health and beauty organization deserves recognition for what they've accomplished since the merger and many years before the merger. 
While the business has fit well with WestRock's portfolio of packaging solutions, publically held peers within home, health and beauty are valued at higher multiples in WestRock overall. And in fact, our home, health and beauty business may fit even better with another company. 
Accordingly, our board has authorized us to evaluate strategic alternatives for the home, health and beauty business. These alternatives include the potential sale of the business during the first half of calendar 2017. In the event we sell the business for cash, we expect to use the sale proceeds consistent with our balance capital allocation strategy. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward."
33897,403988662,1078162,"WestRock Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","IRSM Media Ltd","Executives","Thank you, Steve. We are making great progress on monetizing our land and development portfolio. We completed the $13 million after-tax sale of a residential apartment complex during the quarter. As discussed on our previous call, we expect to realize 0.5",622,"Thank you, Steve. We are making great progress on monetizing our land and development portfolio. We completed the $13 million after-tax sale of a residential apartment complex during the quarter. As discussed on our previous call, we expect to realize 0.5 of the $275 million to $300 million in net after-tax free cash flow during fiscal 2017. 
As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the September quarter at an annual run rate of $500 million. Fiscal 2016 productivity was driven by insourcing initiatives, procurement, actions to rationalize our footprint, return generating capital investments and merger-related synergies. We expect to achieve an $800 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017 and remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of fiscal 2018. 
Fourth quarter adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $27 million, driven in part by unfavorable volume, the anticipated impact of price and mix and inflation of both input cost and labor. The impact of these 3 items was nearly offset by ongoing productivity improvements. 
On a full year basis, the combined company adjusted EBITDA declined by $51 million, driven by lower volume and favorable pricing mix, wage and other input cost inflation. However, we were able to offset much of these items by delivering $384 million of productivity improvements. 
In summary, both the quarter and the full fiscal year were successful. And I'd like to thank all of our employees for making this happen. 
As we look back at the first 5 quarters of WestRock, we have allocated $2.8 billion of capital. We have invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures over the last 15 months and continue to see numerous attractive return-generating opportunities. 
We returned $1.14 billion or almost half of the total to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of cash to stockholders via dividends and share buybacks will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. 
In the first quarter, we expect sequential earnings will be lower, in line with seasonal -- with the seasonal pattern we experienced last year. I'd like to remind you that from Q4 fiscal 2015 to Q1 fiscal 2016, segment income declined by $88 million. We have outlined several of the drivers of the first quarter and full year on Slide 12. 
For Q1, we anticipate that pricing mix will be negative as the impact of the previously announced corrugated price increase will be more than offset by the flow through of the previously published consumer price decreases. 
The first quarter is typically our heaviest maintenance period, and we are planning 160,000 tons of downtime. Volumes will likely decline, driven by 4 less shipping days in our Container business. Consumer grades experience seasonal softness in the first quarter as well. Inflation of input prices will continue in the period. And finally, Hurricane Matthew will negatively impact us by approximately $15 million to $20 million. These items should lead you to a first quarter adjusted EPS lower than what we delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, but increasing steadily as we make our way through the year. 
For the full year fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion, including approximately $150 million of land and development after-tax cash flow. We expect to invest approximately $750 million in CapEx. We also expect to realize significant productivity as well as meaningful inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas, recycled fiber and certain chemicals. Both tax rates are estimated at 34% to 35%, and cash tax rates are in the high 20s. 
Steve, I will hand it back to you for closing comments."

Let me walk you through the details of the $1.2 billion. I'll  already highlight 3 things. You're right, we do have the contribution of $150 million from land and development versus a small use from land and development in fiscal 2016. In earnings, we have modeled in the implementation of containerboard price increase. That's partially offset by the full year impact of the flow through of the previously announced PPW decreases in some of our consumer grades, along with a negative impact of input cost inflation. So if you take our current pricing for some of our key raw materials and you compare that to the average of those prices in 2016, you could easily model between $175 million and $200 million of inflation on a year-over-year basis. Our working capital and other balance sheet items include -- should be a source as we expand some of our payment terms with our vendors through our supply chain financing programs. The other thing that I would also call out is that we've got some noncash-related earnings. I think we highlighted at the equity and nonconsolidated affiliates, that's Gondi, and it's also the portion of our land and development holdings that are not -- where we don't have a consolidating interest. And we've highlighted that as a negative $6 million for the full year."

On the latter, can you give us an update on what your thoughts for interest expense might be next year, both cash and book, if there's any differences? And then we just came back from a conference where there was a lot of discussion on lightweight high-performance grades in containerboard. Can you remind us what your position is on that? And how SP Fiber helps you there? And ultimately, over time, what percent of the market you think that might be able to represent?"

I think we've all seen a trend of lighter basis weights over the last several decades. Largely though, in the U.S. markets, those have been in the, I would say, the middleweight grades transitioning from 69 and 42 down into the 33s and 35s. When we think about lightweight of sub 26 pounds, that really has been largely unchanged. It was 5% to 6% 30 years ago. And frankly, today, it's about the same. Now with that said, the Dublin mill has added some significant flexibility for us, as we're able to go down really into the micro basis weights of 70 GSM or a 14-pound board that we do have applications for in our Corrugated business. Some of the specialty food products grades, we now have the ability to integrate that with our own paper supply. So we're quite excited about the future of that particular segment of the market."
