Thanks for joining us today. This morning, we announced our Q4 results. Total company sales declined 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAA",3307,"Well, thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. This morning, we announced our Q4 results. Total company sales declined 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP operating income rate was flat at 5.1% versus Q4 of last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.26. This was at the lower end of our guidance due to soft sales, and includes a headwind of about $0.02 per share from the stronger U.S. dollar. 
In 2015, our top priority was to stabilize total company sales and earnings per share after a couple of years of heavy investments to transform Staples. For the full year, sales were down less than 1% versus 2014, excluding the impact of store closures and foreign exchange. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015 came in at $0.89 per share. And if you exclude a $0.04 to headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar, our non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year were down about $0.03 versus last year. 
We continue to make good progress on many of our key initiatives in Q4. We grow solid growth in categories beyond office supplies in North American contract. We improved profitability in Staples.com. We delivered strong growth in our omni-channel offering. We grew copy and print in stores and online. We grew the top line and improved portfolio Australia, New Zealand and China. We continue to right size our retail network and preserve profitability across the chain. We exceeded our 2-year goal to reduce cost by $500 million. We improved operating margin rate in our North American businesses. And we extended the Office Depot merger agreement and financing arrangements to allow for the completion of ongoing federal court litigation with the Federal Trade Commission. 
Let me give you a little more color on our fourth quarter highlights. And I'll start with North American contract, where sales were flat in local currency during the fourth quarter, we were up against our toughest comparison of the year in Q4. On a 2-year stack basis, sales grew 7% in local currency during the fourth quarter, and this was consistent with the 2-year trend we've achieved throughout 2015. Over the past few years, we've added nearly 300 specialists to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies, enhanced our contract website and introduced new digital selling tools to our sales team. We continue to benefit from those investments during the fourth quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in breakroom supplies and promotional products and high single digit growth in facility supplies. In total, contract sales in categories beyond office supplies grew in the low single-digit during the fourth quarter and now account for approximately half of our entire contract sales mix. 
Staples.com. We remain focused on balancing sales growth with profit improvement. During Q4, sales were up 1% in local currency, and operating margin rate increased by more than 100 basis points. We achieved gross margin dollars growth versus Q4 of last year. This year, we had a more targeted approach to driving profitable promotions with small business customers. We also continued to improve customer conversion on our desktop and mobile websites as a result of the investments we've made to improve the user experience. Customers continue to embrace our omni-channel offering, which grew double digits during Q4 and for the full year. In 2015, we generated nearly $0.5 billion of omni-channel sales through our in-store Staples.com kiosk as well as our click-and-collect features like Buy Online, Pick Up in Store. During the fourth quarter, we began piloting our newest omni-channel capability, Ship From Store. Ship from Store improves the customer experience. It allows us to manage our inventory more efficiently and positions us for same-day delivery. Early results are encouraging. 
Turning to copy and print. Same-store sales in North America were up in the low single-digit during the fourth quarter. Our copy and print account managers continue to drive growth with small and medium business customers. We grow strong traffic to stores for key categories like business cards and signs and banners. We also achieved solid growth in services like shredding at shipping throughout the year. Copy and print is having a growing impact on our business. Today, copy and print represents nearly 10% of our retail sales mix, and generates a gross margin rate that is well above the half [ph]. 
In Australia -- Australia, New Zealand business, we grew the top line and improved the bottom line for the third consecutive quarter. And we've built on our momentum in the China achieving strong double-digit sales growth and profitability during the fourth quarter. In North American stores, we continued to take aggressive action to right size our store networks. During Q4, we closed 12 stores, bringing our total store closures to 242 in North America over the past couple of years. We also continued to improve store productivity. Gross margin dollars per square foot were up year-over-year, and we drove operating margin rate improvement versus Q4 of last year. 
In summary, we got a lot done during the fourth quarter and the full year as we continue to transform Staples. That said, we also came up short on our goals in a few key areas and we have more work to do. In North American contract, while sales prints were stable on a 2-year stack basis, our plans call for low single-digit sales growth in Q4. The majority of the difference was driven by softer-than-expected macro trends and fewer large customer wins in beyond office supplies categories versus Q4 of last year. 
In  North American Stores & Online, customer traffic was weak during the fourth quarter. Some of this headwind was driven by our decision to be less promotional during the holiday season and not to open our stores on Thanksgiving Day. But beyond these headwinds, we continue to face weak traffic in our stores and our desktop website in the United States. In Europe, we continue to make progress restructuring the business. Unfortunately, our progress was more than offset by significant headwinds during Q4. During 2015, we've faced pressure from the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on our dollar-denominated product cost. These headwinds have been most pronounced in Europe contract for many of our larger customers at fixed-price agreements that didn't allow for us to immediately pass along cost increases. During Q4, these headwinds continued and we didn't have as much success recovering the increased costs as we have planned. The bottom line in Europe was also pressured by customer disruptions from an ERP implementation in our UK contract business as well as the highly promotional retail environment during the holidays. Despite these headwinds, we did generate a profit in Europe during Q4, although our bottom line results came in below our expectations. 
Better news relates to the investments we've made reduced cost on a global basis. When we reported our third quarter results, we were on track to hit our 2-year goal of $500 million of annualized cost reductions. As a result of weaker sales in Q4, we made the decision to take out additional cost and also to streamline our organization during the quarter bringing our 2-year annualized cost reductions to approximately $550 million. 
We had a few goals in streamlining the organization. We wanted to build a simplified structure that will speed up decision making. We wanted to reduce cost, and we wanted to improve financial flexibility to pursue our critical objectives in 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, we also made leadership changes to drive these objectives and better position Staples for the future. Shira Goodman was named President North American Operations. She now has responsibility for our business-to-business, online and retail operations across the United States and Canada. John Wilson was named President of International Operations and Transformation. He now has responsibility for operations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and Asia, and John will also lead the company strategy and overall transformation efforts. In their new roles, Shira and John will be responsible for driving results against our 2016 company-wide objectives. We'll focus on just 3 critical priorities, and this build on our success over the past few years and they also address the areas where we've come up short of our goals. In 2016, we're completely focused on doing fewer things better. And I'm pleased to report that we expect to get back to earnings growth in 2016. 
First, we'll accelerate growth in categories beyond office supplies. These categories account for approximately $10 billion of our global sales, which is just under half of our total company sales mix. Our growth beyond office supplies will be fueled by a few key categories: planning and breakroom supplies, mail and ship supplies and services. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've added hundreds of specialists to drive growth beyond office supplies in our contract business over the past few years. In 2016, we plan to build on this success by adding more than 100 incremental specialists, bringing our total to more than 1,000 contract specialists focused on beyond office supplies growth. 
We'll also expand our assortment in categories beyond office supplies through Staples brand offerings. Customers trust the value and expertise of Staples branded products and core categories and also beyond office supplies categories as well. 
Our second objective is to grow our mid-market penetration in contract. There are hundreds of thousands of mid-market customers that we don't serve today. And they're spending billions of dollars a year on the products and services we sell. We're increasing our focus on customer acquisition and retention and also growing our share of wallet. In 2016, we'll increase the size of our mid-market acquisition sales force by more than 20%. We'll strengthen our value proposition with our mid-market loyalty program which is driving increased expand and greater share, higher retention rates and increased customer engagement. And we'll leverage the strength of our category specialists to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies. Historically, there has been an overlap between our Staples.com and mid-market contract businesses. Our new simplified structure will help us better serve these customers. 
And our third priority is to improve traffic, both in stores and online. Weak customer traffic was a significant hurdle for us this last year, and driving customers to our store and online is crucial to our success in 2016. In stores, we're focused on improving customer conversion, accelerating growth in our services business and building our omni-channel momentum. Online, we'll continue to sharpen our pricing, ensure that customers fully understand the value that Staples provides and expand our assortment of products and services. 
These 3 priorities for 2016 are critical for Staples to succeed either as a standalone company or combined with Office Depot. 
Before I review our segment results, let me just give you an update on the Office Depot acquisition. First of all, our commitment to the acquisition hasn't changed. Our top priority is to get the deal done. The acquisition will position us to better serve the changing needs of business customers and also allow us compete more effectively against the large and diverse set of competitors. 
During the fourth quarter, the Federal Trade Commission and the Canadian Competition Bureau challenged the acquisition. The FTC's argument is that this transaction would lead to the largest and most powerful companies in the world paying higher prices for sticky notes, pens, pencils, notepads, file folders, paper clips and copy paper. When in fact, we have publicly committed to reinvest a significant portion of the merger synergies to lower prices for all customers. 
In addition, the FTC has established an incredibly narrow market definition to fit its narrative. It is also concerned with B2B customers that spend at least $500,000 a year on just these categories, which is a tiny portion of the overall marketplace. In fact, more than 99% of our commercial customers will be unaffected by the merger even based on the FTC's narrow view of the market.  In reaching its decision, we believe that the FTC is acting against the best interest of hundreds of thousands of business customers and millions of consumers who would benefit from this acquisition. The FTC is also completely ignoring the millions of our products beyond office supplies that customers purchase from us, everything from cleaning supplies to breakroom snacks, to furniture and technology. They're also conveniently excluding ink and toner, which is one of our largest core categories from their market definition. The FTC's actions are based on a flawed and very narrow definition of the marketplace and a deep misunderstanding of the competitive landscape. Unfortunately, the FTC completely disregards and disruptive effect of stronger and larger new competitors in the digital economy. The FTC's decision also ignores the reasoning in its own unanimous approval of the Office Depot, OfficeMax merger in 2013. At that time, the FTC acknowledged that Staples and Office Depot face strong position from a host of competitors. Since 2013, competition has materially intensified, not lessened, including share gains by Amazon and other Internet players, big-box retailers, independent distributors and many others. In an effort to address the FTC's concerns, we've proposed divesting up to $1.25 billion of commercial contract business and related assets. The FTC promptly rejected our offer. Nevertheless, we continue to make progress on the acquisition. On February 2, we completed the extension of our acquisition financing arrangements and extended the merger agreement from February 4 to May 16. The extension will allow us for the completion of federal court litigation with the FTC. The preliminary junction hearing is scheduled to begin on March 21 and we expect the decision by Math 10. 
The European Commission announced on February 10 that it has approved the transaction on the condition that we divest Office Depot's European contract business and all of Office Depot's operations in Sweden. We have committed to meet these requirements, and we will also divest Office Depot's retail, online and catalog operations in Europe in connection with closing the merger. We are very pleased with the European Commission's approval. I think the acquisition has now been approved in Australia, New Zealand, China and 23 countries in Europe. Regulatory agencies around the world clearly understands the value that this transaction will bring to customers of all sizes. 
We also recently extended -- entered into an agreement with Essendant to divest more than $550 million of office products revenue and related assets, subject to the successful completion of the acquisition. The commercial business and assets being divested relate primarily to accounts where Staples and Office Depot act as wholesalers to minority and women-owned office-supply retailers. Approximately half the revenue we plan to divest to Essendant is from Fortune 500 companies, and more than 25% of the revenue is from Fortune 100 companies. 
We remain prepared to hit the ground running with our integration plans once the deal is approved. And we remain committed to our previous target of more than $1 billion of net synergies over the 3-year integration period. And as a reminder, this target is net of investments to provide increased value to our customers. 
In summary, the acquisition of Office Depot is good for customers. It's good for associates, and it's good for our shareholders. This has been a surprisingly long and frustrating road, and we look forward to a full and fair judicial review as we fight to complete the acquisition. 
Now let's take a very quick look at the fourth quarter results for each of our business units. And I'm going to start with the North American Commercial. Their sales were flat year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of changes in FX rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in the U.S. dollars were down 1% to $2 billion versus last year. And contract sales were also flat on a local currency business -- basis. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we continued to drive good growth in categories beyond office supplies and contract during Q4. We achieved double-digit sales growth in breakroom supplies and promotional products. And sales were up in high single digits in facility supplies. This momentum was offset by modest sales decline in our contract print and technology business. We also felt a headwind in contract furniture where we're up against sales growth of more than 30% in Q4 last year. Contract sales in core office categories like ink and toner and paper were down in the low single digits, and sales of office supplies increased about 1% versus the prior year.  During the fourth quarter, North American Commercial operative margin rate increased 57 basis points to 7.6% and operating income grew $10 million. This improvement primarily reflects increased product margin rate and lower incentive compensation expense of versus Q4 of last year, and this was partially offset by investments in sales force to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies. 
Turning to North American Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 4%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales decline 9% to $2.4 billion versus Q4 of last year. During the fourth quarter, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 4%. This reflects 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 5% decline in same-store sales. Same-store sales were negatively impacted by about 1% as a result of our decision to close our stores on Thanksgiving Day. Results in Canada were stronger than in the U.S. in both stores and online during the fourth quarter. 
From a category perspective. The 5% decline in same-store sales during Q4 was entirely driven by ongoing weakness in technology, computers, mobility, playing hardware and technology accessories all declined in the double digits. Given the margin characteristics of technology hardware, the impact on the bottom line was not as dramatic as the sales headwind from technology. 
Outside of technology, same-store sales were about flat during the fourth quarter. This was driven by growth in copy and print and mail and ship supplies and relatively flat sales in office supplies and furniture year-over-year.  
North American Stores & Online operating margin increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 5.1%. This primarily reflects improved product margin rates and lower incentive compensation expense versus Q4 of last year. And this was partially offset by increased delivery expense, increased marketing expenses as a percentage of sales, and the negative impact of lower sales on fixed cost -- fixed expenses. 
Turning to International operations. Sales decreased 1%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollar were down 12% year-over-year to $791 million versus Q4 of last year. 
In our contract business in Europe, local currency sales were down in the mid-single digits during the fourth quarter. In Europe retail, same-store sales declined 11% during the fourth quarter driven primarily by decrease in customer traffic versus Q4 of last year. That's largely due to our less promotional approach during the holiday season. And in our European online business, local currency sales were down in the low single digits. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we continue to make great progress driving year-over-year growth and improved profitability in Australia, New Zealand and China. These improvements once again helped to offset some of the pressures we've been experiencing in Europe. 
On the bottom line, International Operations was about breakeven for the fourth quarter. Operator margin rate decreased 212 basis points compared to Q4 of last year. This decrease primarily reflects lower product margin rate in Europe contract and a negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses in Europe, partially offset by improved profitability in Australia and China and in South America. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our financials."

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined 2% versus Q4 of last year. This excludes a 4% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rate and a 1% headwind from a stores we closed in North America during the past year. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 7% versus Q4 of last year. During the fourth quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.26. This was at the lower end of our guidance, and it excludes pretax charges of $172 million primarily related to the restructuring and the acquisition of Office Depot as well as the impact of certain tax items. On a GAAP basis, we reported net earnings of $0.13 per share. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased 6 basis points to 26.2% versus Q4 of the last year. This primarily reflects product margin rate increases in  North American Stores & Online, partially offset by lower product margin rate in Europe as well as increased delivery costs in North American Stores and Online. During the fourth quarter, total company SG&A decreased $85 million year-over-year after, after excluding a $36 million charge in Q4 of this year primarily related to the acquisition of Office Depot and the previously announced data security incident as well as $5 million of accelerated depreciation during the fourth quarter last year. This reflects the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and aggressive cost management across the company. As a percentage of sales, SG&A, excluding charges, decreased 7 basis points to 20.9%. In Q4, we wrapped up our 2-year cost-reduction program. As Ron mentioned, we did respond to softer-than-expected sales and earnings during the fourth quarter by taking aggressive options in streamlining our organization. As a result, we eliminated more than 1,000 jobs across the company in Q4 bringing our 2-year annualized cost take-out to approximately $550 million. Over the past 2 years, we've had great success reducing product cost, eliminating expenses in our retail stores, driving efficiencies in the supply chain and streamlining our European operations. Most importantly, we have changed the way we work. The lessons we've learned set us extremely well to continue driving cost efficiencies across the organization in 2016 and beyond. Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate was flat year-over-year at 5.1%. 
Turning to our Q4 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges and certain discrete items, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28.6% in Q4 of 2014. During Q4 of last year, contract extended at certain provision in the U.S. tax code that allowed for federal wage tax credit and the deferral of the income in certain foreign earning. This drove the favorability in last year's fourth quarter effective tax rate and resulted in a $0.02 tailwind to Q4 2014 diluted earnings per share. During Q4 of 2015, Congress extended the same provision as last year, but the favorable impact was offset by the year-over-year change in our geographic mix of earnings. In 2016, we are planning for our effective tax rate to be approximately 35.5%. We expect a modest year-over-year increase to be primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. Year-to-date, capital expenditures came in at $381 million, an increase of $20 million versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $978 million, we generated free cash flow of $597 million in 2015, which was in line with our expectations. Throughout 2015, we carefully managed working capital. And at the end of the year, our AP-to-inventory ratio improved 91% versus 87% at the end of 2014. We continue to focus on building cash ahead of the Office Depot acquisition, and as a result, we did not purchase any shares during 2015. At the end of 2015, Staples had approximately $1.9 billion in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $825 million and available lines of credits of about $1.1 billion. During 2015, we returned $308 million or about half of our free cash flow to shareholders through our cash dividend. We remain committed to maintaining our current quarterly dividend. And earlier this week, we announced a Q1 2016 cash dividend of $0.12 per share. 
Now turning to our outlook. As Ron mentioned earlier, we do expect to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decrease versus Q1 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our delivery businesses in North America. We will be -- this will be offset by ongoing weaknesses in technology and our retail stores, moderating headwinds from our stronger U.S. dollar as well as store closures. On the bottom line, we expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from -- in the range of $0.16 to $0.18. Our earnings guidance excludes any potential cost related to the company's planned acquisition of Office Depot and the impact related to ongoing store closures. We expect to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016, and our cash flow guidance excludes financing payments related to the acquisition of Office Depot. In 2016, we plan to close approximately 50 retail stores in North America. This will bring our total store closures to nearly 300 since the beginning of 2014.

We're going to growth BOS growth because that's where the growth is compared to historically the office supplies is not growing like BOS has been growing. And we're going to focus on traffic.

How do you pay for all this new stuff, adding sales people and you're adding contract specialists, et cetera. All I can tell you is that we're pretty good at reducing expenses. We know how to do that. We've also kind of streamlined the organization. We changed the way we're working across the organization. And I think in 2016, we expect to pursue additional opportunities to reduce our cost. We took out $200 million in 2013. We took out another $250 million in 2014. And the year we just announced, we took out $300 million. And I think we'll continue to take out cost to support the investments as well as provide the contact to profitable growth and earnings growth that we've just talked about this morning in 2016.

And in fact, our 2-year sales growth was relatively constant. And so when we broke that apart, it was primarily due to some very atypical number of BOS wins in the prior year as well as a little bit on macro trends, but primarily the atypical BOS wins. It was also worth noting that our gap versus Office Depot has really remained constant over time. And if anything, it's accelerating a tad. Regarding the independent fielders, we don't have a sense really that they're gaining share. One of our best indicators is looking at Essendant and SP Richards. And while I think the dealers are shifting between which wholesaler they use, and that's driving some different sales momentum across the 2 wholesalers, we're not seeing a lot of evidence of share gain amongst the independent dealers."

The other thing I would say about mid-market is that it is a huge company opportunity, and that's something that this new organizational structure really facilities. So we have tens of thousands of them who are current contract customers, but we have hundreds of thousands of companies of that size. And I'm talking about companies roughly 10 to 250 employees who shot Staples either through our stores and online. So they like Staples, they know Staples, they shop Staples, but often as a secondary or a tertiary supplier. And we think we can use our existing relationships with those customers, and they just don't even know that we have a business unit like contract that can better serve their needs, given them the customized pricing and the personalized experience, the product expertise that they really know. And I think in doing that, we will grab share from a lot of folks out there in the market, we'll grab it from the dealer community, we'll grab it from retailers for things like breakroom, they buy a lot from warehouse clubs. We'll grab it from share play online. So it's a big opportunity for us, and we're very excited about it and have some good momentum."

Thanks for joining us today. This morning, we announced our Q4 results. Total company sales declined 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAA",3319,"Well, thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. This morning, we announced our Q4 results. Total company sales declined 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP operating income rate was flat at 5.1% versus Q4 of last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.26. This was at the lower end of our guidance due to soft sales and includes a headwind of about $0.02 per share from the stronger U.S. dollar. 
In 2015, our top priority was to stabilize total company sales and earnings per share after a couple of years of heavy investment to transform Staples. For the full year, sales were down less than 1% versus 2014, excluding the impact of store closures and foreign exchange. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015 came in at $0.89 per share. And if you exclude a $0.04 headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar, our non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year were down about $0.03 versus last year. 
We continue to make good progress on many of our key initiatives in Q4. We grow [ph] solid growth in categories beyond office supplies in North American Contract. We improved profitability in Staples.com. We delivered strong growth in our omni-channel offering. We grew copy and print in stores and online. We grew the top line and improved profitability in Australia, New Zealand and China. We continued to right-size our retail network and preserve profitability across the chain. We exceeded our 2-year goal to reduce costs by $500 million. We improved operating margin rate in our North American businesses. And we extended the Office Depot merger agreement and financing arrangements to allow for the completion of ongoing federal court litigation with the Federal Trade Commission. 
Let me give you a little more color on our fourth quarter highlights. And I'll start with North American Contract, where sales were flat in local currency during the fourth quarter. We were up against our toughest comparison of the year in Q4. On a 2-year stacked basis, sales grew 7% in local currency during the fourth quarter, and this was consistent with the 2-year trend we've achieved throughout 2015. 
Over the past few years, we've added nearly 300 specialists to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies, enhanced our contract website and introduced new digital selling tools to our sales team. We continue to benefit from those investments during the fourth quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in breakroom supplies and promotional products and high single-digit growth in facility supplies. In total, contract sales in categories beyond office supplies grew in the low single digits during the fourth quarter and now account for approximately half of our entire contract sales mix. 
In Staples.com, we remain focused on balancing sales growth with profit improvement. During Q4, sales were up 1% in local currency, and operating margin rate increased by more than 100 basis points. We achieved gross margin dollar growth versus Q4 of last year. This year, we had a more targeted approach to driving profitable promotions with small business customers. We also continued to improve customer conversion on our desktop and mobile websites as a result of the investments we've made to improve the user experience. 
Customers continue to embrace our omni-channel offering, which grew double digits during Q4. And for the full year in 2015, we generated nearly $0.5 billion of omni-channel sales through our in-store Staples.com kiosk as well as our click & collect features like Buy Online, Pick Up in Store. During the fourth quarter, we began piloting our newest omni-channel capability, Ship From Store. Ship from Store improves the customer experience, it allows us to manage our inventory more efficiently and positions us for same-day delivery. Early results are encouraging. 
Turning to copy and print. Same-store sales in North America were up in the low single digits during the fourth quarter. Our copy and print account managers continue to drive growth with small and medium business customers. We grow strong traffic to stores for key categories like business cards and signs and banners. We also achieved solid growth in services like shredding and shipping throughout the year. Copy and print is having a growing impact on our business. Today, copy and print represents nearly 10% of our retail sales mix and generates a gross margin rate that is well above the house.. 
In our Australia/New Zealand business, we grew the top line and improved the bottom line for the third consecutive quarter. And we've built on our momentum in the China, achieving strong, double-digit sales growth and profitability during the fourth quarter. 
In North American stores, we continued to take aggressive action to right-size our store network. During Q4, we closed 12 stores, bringing our total store closures to 242 in North America over the past couple of years. We also continued to improve store productivity. Gross margin dollars per square foot were up year-over-year, and we drove operating margin rate improvement versus Q4 of last year. 
In summary, we got a lot done during the fourth quarter and the full year as we continued to transform Staples. That said, we also came up short on our goals in a few key areas and we have more work to do. In North American Contract, while sales trends were stable on a 2-year stacked basis, our plans call for low single-digit sales growth in Q4. The majority of the difference was driven by softer-than-expected macro trends and fewer large customer wins in beyond office supplies categories versus Q4 of last year. 
In  North American Stores and Online, customer traffic was weak during the fourth quarter. Some of this headwind was driven by our decision to be less promotional during the holiday season and not to open our stores on Thanksgiving Day. But beyond these headwinds, we continued to face weak traffic in our stores and our desktops website in the United States. 
In Europe, we continue to make progress restructuring the business. Unfortunately, our progress was more than offset by some significant headwinds during Q4. During 2015, we faced pressure from the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on our dollar-denominated product costs. These headwinds have been most pronounced in Europe contract where many of our large customers have fixed-price agreements that didn't allow for us to immediately pass along cost increases. During Q4, these headwinds continued and we didn't have as much success recovering the increased costs as we had planned. The bottom line in Europe was also pressured by customer disruptions from an ERP implementation in our U.K. contract business as well as the highly promotional retail environment during the holidays. 
Despite these headwinds, we did generate a profit in Europe during Q4, but our bottom line results came in below our expectations. 
Better news relates to the investments we've made to reduce cost on a global basis. When we reported our third quarter results, we were on track to hit our 2-year goal of $500 million of annualized cost reductions. As a result of weaker sales in Q4, we made the decision to take out additional cost and also to streamline our organization during the quarter, bringing our 2-year annualized cost reductions to approximately $550 million. 
We had a few goals in streamlining the organization: we wanted to build a simplified structure that will speed up decision making, we wanted to reduce cost and we wanted to improve financial flexibility to pursue our critical objectives in 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, we also made leadership changes to drive these objectives and better position Staples for the future. Shira Goodman was named President, North American Operations. She now has responsibility for our business-to-business, online and retail operations across the United States and Canada. John Wilson was named President of International Operations and Transformation. He now has responsibility for operations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and Asia, and John will also lead the company's strategy and overall transformation efforts. In their new roles, Shira and John will be responsible for driving results against our 2016 company-wide objectives. We'll focus on just 3 critical priorities. And these build on our success over the past few years, and they also address the areas where we've come up short of our goals.  
In 2016, we're completely focused on doing fewer things better, and I'm pleased to report that we expect to get back to earnings growth in 2016.  First, we'll accelerate growth in categories beyond office supplies. These categories account for approximately $10 billion of our global sales, which is just under half of our total company sales mix. 
Our growth beyond office supplies will be fueled by a few key categories: cleaning and breakroom supplies, mail and ship supplies and services. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've added hundreds of specialists to drive growth beyond office supplies in our contract business over the past few years. In 2016, we plan to build on this success by adding more than 100 incremental specialists, bringing our total to more than 1,000 contract specialists focused on beyond office supplies growth. 
We'll also expand our assortment in categories beyond office supplies through Staples brand offerings. Customers trust the value and expertise of Staples-branded products in both core categories and also beyond office supplies categories as well. 
Our second objective is to grow our mid-market penetration in contract. There are hundreds of thousands of mid-market customers that we don't serve today. And they're spending billions of dollars a year on the products and services we sell. We're increasing our focus on customer acquisition and retention and also growing our share of wallet. In 2016, we'll increase the size of our mid-market acquisition sales force by more than 20%. We'll strengthen our value proposition with our mid-market loyalty program, which is driving increased spend and greater share, higher retention rates and increased customer engagement. And we'll leverage the strength of our category specialists to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies. Historically, there has been an overlap between our Staples.com and mid-market contract businesses; our new simplified structure will help us better serve these customers. 
And our third priority is to improve traffic, both in stores and online. Weak customer traffic was a significant hurdle for us this last year, and driving customers to our store and online is crucial to our success in 2016. In stores, we're focused on improving customer conversion, accelerating growth in our services business and building our omni-channel momentum. Online, we'll continue to sharpen our pricing, ensure that customers fully understand the value that Staples provides and expand our assortment of products and services. 
These 3 priorities for 2016 are critical for Staples to succeed either as a stand-alone company or combined with Office Depot. 
Before I review our segment results, let me just give you an update on the Office Depot acquisition. 
First of all, our commitment to the acquisition hasn't changed. Our top priority is to get the deal done. The acquisition will position us to better serve the changing needs of business customers and also allow us to compete more effectively against a large and diverse set of competitors. 
During the fourth quarter, the Federal Trade Commission and the Canadian Competition Bureau challenged the acquisition. The FTC's argument is that this transaction would lead to the largest and most powerful companies in the world paying higher prices for sticky notes, pens, pencils, notepads, file folders, paper clips and copy paper, when in fact we have publicly committed to reinvest a significant portion of the merger synergies to lower prices for all customers. 
In addition, the FTC has established an incredibly narrow market definition to fit its narrative. It is only concerned with B2B customers that spend at least $500,000 a year on just these categories, which is a tiny portion of the overall marketplace. In fact, more than 99% of our commercial customers will be unaffected by the merger even based on the FTC's narrow view of the market.  
In reaching its decision, we believe that the FTC is acting against the best interest of hundreds of thousands of business customers and millions of consumers who would benefit from this acquisition. The FTC is also completely ignoring the millions of products beyond office supplies that customers purchase from us, everything from cleaning supplies to breakroom snacks, to furniture and technology. They're also conveniently excluding ink and toner, which is one of our largest core categories, from their market definition. 
The FTC's actions are based on a flawed and very narrow definition of the marketplace and a deep misunderstanding of the competitive landscape. Unfortunately, the FTC completely disregards the disruptive effect of stronger and larger new competitors in the digital economy. 
The FTC's decision also ignores the reasoning in its own unanimous approval of the Office Depot-OfficeMax merger in 2013. At that time, the FTC acknowledged that Staples and Office Depot faced strong position from a host of competitors. Since 2013, competition has materially intensified, not lessened, including share gains by Amazon and other Internet players, big-box retailers, independent distributors and many others in an effort to address the FTC's concerns, we proposed divesting up to $1.25 billion of commercial contract business and related assets. The FTC promptly rejected our offer. 
Nevertheless, we continue to make progress on the acquisition. On February 2, we completed the extension of our acquisition financing arrangements and extended the merger agreement from February 4 to May 16. The extension will allow us for the completion of federal court litigation with the FTC. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled to begin on March 21, and we expect a decision by May 10. 
The European Commission announced on February 10 that it has approved the transaction on the condition that we divest Office Depot's European contract business and all of Office Depot's operations in Sweden. We have committed to meet these requirements, and we will also divest Office Depot's retail, online and catalog operations in Europe in connection with closing the merger. We're all -- we are very pleased the -- with the European Commission's approval. I think the acquisition has now been approved in Australia, New Zealand, China and 23 countries in Europe. Regulatory agencies around the world clearly understand the value that this transaction will bring to customers of all sizes. 
We also recently extended -- entered into an agreement with Essendant to divest more than $550 million of office products revenue and related assets, subject to the successful completion of the acquisition. The commercial business and assets being divested relate primarily to accounts where Staples and Office Depot act as wholesalers to minority and women-owned office supply resellers. Approximately half the revenue we plan to divest to Essendant is from Fortune 500 companies, and more than 25% of the revenue is from Fortune 100 companies. 
We remain prepared to hit the ground running with our integration plans once the deal is approved, and we remain committed to our previous target of more than $1 billion of net synergies over the 3-year integration period. And as a reminder, this target is net of investments to provide increased value to our customers. 
In summary, the acquisition of Office Depot is good for customers, it's good for associates and it's good for our shareholders. This has been a surprisingly long and frustrating road, and we look forward to a full and fair judicial review as we fight to complete the acquisition. 
Now let's take a very quick look at the fourth quarter results for each of our business units. And I'm going to start with the North American Commercial. Their sales were flat year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of changes in FX rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 1% to $2 billion versus last year. And contract sales were also flat on a local currency business -- sorry, basis. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we committed -- we continue to drive good growth in categories beyond office supplies and contract during Q4, we achieved double-digit sales growth in breakroom supplies and promotional products and sales were up in the high single digits in facility supplies. This momentum was offset by modest sales declines in our contract print and technology business. We also felt a headwind in contract furniture where we're up against sales growth of more than 30% in Q4 last year. Contract sales in core office categories like ink and toner and paper were down in the low single digits, and sales of office supplies increased about 1% versus the prior year.  
During the fourth quarter, North American Commercial operative margin rate increased 57 basis points to 7.6% and operating income grew $10 million. This improvement primarily reflects increased product margin rate and lower incentive compensation expense versus Q4 of last year, and this was partially offset by investments in sales force to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies. 
Turning to North American Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 4%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 9% to $2.4 billion versus Q4 of last year. 
During the fourth quarter, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 4%. This reflects 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 5% decline in same-store sales. Same-store sales were negatively impacted by about 1% as a result of our decision to close our stores on Thanksgiving Day. Results in Canada were stronger than in the U.S. in both stores and online during the fourth quarter. 
From a category perspective, the 5% decline in same-store sales during Q4 was entirely driven by ongoing weakness in technology. Computers, mobility, printing hardware and technology accessories all declined in the double digits. Given the margin characteristics of technology hardware, the impact on the bottom line was not as dramatic as the sales headwind from technology. Outside of technology, same-store sales were about flat during the fourth quarter. This was driven by growth in copy and print and mail and ship supplies and relatively flat sales in office supplies and furniture year-over-year.  
North American Stores and Online operating margin increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 5.1%. This primarily reflects improved product margin rates and lower incentive compensation expense versus Q4 of last year, and this was partially offset by increased delivery expense, increased marketing expense as a percentage of sales and the negative impact of lower sales on fixed cost -- fixed expenses. 
Turning to International Operations. Sales decreased 1%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 12% year-over-year to $791 million versus Q4 of last year. 
In our contract business in Europe, local currency sales were down in the mid-single digits during the fourth quarter. In Europe retail, same-store sales declined 11% during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a decrease in customer traffic versus Q4 of last year. And that's largely due to our less promotional approach during the holiday season. And in our European online business, local currency sales were down in the low single digits. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we continue to make great progress driving year-over-year growth and improved profitability in Australia, New Zealand and China. These improvements once again helped to offset some of the pressures we've been experiencing in Europe. 
On the bottom line, International Operations was about breakeven for the fourth quarter. Operating margin rate decreased 212 basis points compared to Q4 of last year. This decrease primarily reflects lower product margin rate in Europe contract and the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses in Europe, partially offset by improved profitability in Australia, in China and in South America. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our financials."

Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased 6 basis points to 26.2% versus Q4 of the last year. This primarily reflects product margin rate increases in  North American Stores and Online, partially offset by lower product margin rate in Europe as well as increased delivery costs in North American Stores and Online. 
During the fourth quarter, total company SG&A decreased $85 million year-over-year after excluding a $36 million charge in Q4 of this year primarily related to the acquisition of Office Depot and the previously announced data security incident, as well as $5 million of accelerated depreciation during the fourth quarter last year. This reflects the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and aggressive cost management across the company as a percentage of sales, SG&A, excluding charges, decreased 7 basis points to 20.9%. 
In Q4, we wrapped up our 2-year cost reduction program. As Ron mentioned, we did respond to softer-than-expected sales and earnings during the fourth quarter by taking aggressive actions to streamline our organization. As a result, we eliminated more than 1,000 jobs across the company in Q4, bringing our 2-year annualized cost take-out to approximately $550 million. 
Over the past 2 years, we've had great success reducing product costs, eliminating expenses in our retail stores, driving efficiencies in the supply chain and streamlining our European operations. Most importantly, we have changed the way we work. The lessons we've learned set us up extremely well to continue driving cost efficiencies across the organization in 2016 and beyond. 
Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate was flat year-over-year at 5.1%. 
Turning to our Q4 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges and certain discrete items, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28.6% in Q4 of 2014. During Q4 of last year, Congress extended certain provisions in the U.S. tax code that allowed for federal wage tax credits and the deferral of income on certain foreign earnings. This drove the favorability in last year's fourth quarter effective tax rate and resulted in a $0.02 tailwind to Q4 2014 diluted earnings per share. During Q4 of 2015, Congress extended the same provisions as last year, but the favorable impact was offset by the year-over-year change in our geographic mix of earnings. 
In 2016, we are planning for our effective tax rate to be approximately 35.5%. We expect the modest year-over-year increase to be primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
Year-to-date, capital expenditures came in at $381 million, an increase of $20 million versus the prior year. 
With operating cash flow of $978 million, we generated free cash flow of $597 million in 2015, which was in line with our expectations. 
Throughout 2015, we carefully managed working capital. And at the end of the year, our AP-to-inventory ratio improved 91% versus 87% at the end of 2014. 
We continue to focus on building cash ahead of the Office Depot acquisition. And as a result, we did not purchase any shares during 2015. 
At the end of 2015, Staples had approximately $1.9 billion in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $825 million and available lines of credit of about $1.1 billion. 
During 2015, we returned $308 million, or about half of our free cash flow, to shareholders through our cash dividend. We remain committed to maintaining our current quarterly dividend. And earlier this week, we announced a Q1 2016 cash dividend of $0.12 per share. 
Now turning to our outlook. As Ron mentioned earlier, we do expect to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decrease versus Q1 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our delivery businesses in North America. We will be -- this will be offset by ongoing weaknesses in technology and our retail stores, moderating headwinds from our stronger U.S. dollar as well as store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from -- in the range of $0.16 to $0.18. Our earnings guidance excludes any potential costs related to the company's planned acquisition of Office Depot and the impact related to ongoing store closures. 
We expect to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016, and our cash flow guidance excludes financing payments related to the acquisition of Office Depot. 
In 2016, we plan to close approximately 50 retail stores in North America. This will bring our total store closures to nearly 300 since the beginning of 2014. 
I'll now turn it back over to Joyce, our conference call moderator, for Q&A."

As I mentioned, we really only have 3 objectives this year: we're going to grow the mid-market, our most profitable part of our contract business; we're going to growth BOSS growth because that's where the growth is compared to historically, the office supplies is not growing like BOSS has been growing; and we're going to focus on traffic, and I think we're -- we'll see some improvements in both retail and online traffic as a result of that focus. Now your question's a good one. How do you pay for all this new stuff if you're adding sales people and you're adding contract specialists, et cetera? All I can tell you is that we're pretty good at reducing expenses. We know how to do that. We've also kind of streamlined the organization. We've changed the way we're working across the organization. And I think in 2016, we expect to pursue additional opportunities to reduce our cost. We took out $200 million in 2013. We took out another $250 million in 2014. And the year we just announced, we took out $300 million. And I think we'll continue to take out cost to support the investments as well as provide the context to profitable growth and earnings growth that we've just talked about this morning in 2016. So we'll manage that very carefully, but we do anticipate growing our earnings this year."

It's also worth noting that our gap versus Office Depot has really remained constant over time. And if anything, it's accelerating a tad. Regarding the independent dealers, we don't have a sense really that they're gaining share. One of our best indicators is looking at Essendant and SP Richards. And while I think the dealers are shifting between which wholesaler they use, and that's driving some different sales momentum across the 2 wholesalers, we're not seeing a lot of evidence of share gain amongst the independent dealers."

And the other 30% was related to our execution on a major new ERP rollout. Again, that's stable now and we've got that largely behind us. So I wouldn't necessarily think about changing our entire direction based on the 2015 results. We certainly have the foreign exchange changes now flowing to our -- both our costs and we're renegotiating and breaking contracts where needed to recover those costs as quickly as we can. So I think we're on a good trajectory in 2016 to recover the FX impacts. And I also believe we've got our new ERP system stabilized. We're running consistently for the last month at 95% fill rates within 24 hours. So I think we had challenges in '16 and we've made real progress.

We've also got capital where we would think that will be fairly constant, and we've got working capital which will be fairly constant, although a little bit of an increase given our sales increase -- given our earnings increase. As we look at some of the other areas within the free cash flow pressures that we've got, we've got our restructuring, which will continue to be about $100 million of payout. So net-net, it's never a precise number, but that's why we think it will be about consistent with this year."

So on the contract business, just to be clear, so a lot of the focus will be on the beyond office supply categories. But did I hear right that for this quarter, with the fourth quarter, that business did slow because you weren't able to sign up as many new customers as you did last year? And if that's the case, what was behind that? And does that worry you about your ability to grow that category in the future?"

No, I am not worried about our ability to grow that category in the future. The real issue was that last year in Q4, we had just an -- we always have a couple of large wins in our customers every single quarter, and that often is project furniture wins or very big facilities wins. And it just so happens, as luck had it last year, we had an atypical number of them in Q4, which we were now anniversary-ing this year. So we do believe that there is a lot of runway with our beyond office supplies category. It's -- obviously, for our larger customers but also increasingly for our mid-market customers, one of our biggest challenges and something that the team is really making incredible progress on is how do you sell what we call the BOSS categories to mid-market customers where the economics of bringing in imports and exports does not work, bringing that to a smaller office? And so they've really developed a model. With the combination of digital selling aids as well as virtual specialists, we can bring the expertise necessary to sell these categories to really any size company. And we think that's going to be a big driver of growth for us going forward as well."

So I think our marketing rate will continue to be kind of similar to year-over-year.

The other thing I would say about mid-market is that it is a huge company opportunity, and that's something that this new organizational structure really facilitates. So we have tens of thousands of them who are current contract customers, but we have hundreds of thousands of companies of that size. And I'm talking about companies roughly 10 to 250 employees who shop Staples either through our stores and online. So they like Staples, they know Staples, they shop Staples but often as a secondary or tertiary supplier. And we think we can use our existing relationships with those customers, and they just don't even know that we have a business unit like contract that can better serve their needs, giving them the customized pricing and the personalized experience, the product expertise that they really know. And I think in doing that, we will grab share from a lot of folks out there in the market. We'll grab it from the dealer community. We'll grab it from retailers for things like breakroom they buy a lot from warehouse clubs. We'll grab it from pure play online.

Thanks for joining us today. This morning we announced our Q4 results. Total company sales declined 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP",3318,"Well, thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. This morning we announced our Q4 results. Total company sales declined 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP operating income rate was flat at 5.1% versus Q4 of last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.26. This was at the lower end of our guidance due to soft sales and includes a headwind of about $0.02 per share from the stronger U.S. dollar. 
In 2015, our top priority was to stabilize total company sales and earnings per share after a couple of years of heavy investment to transform Staples. For the full year, sales were down less than 1% versus 2014, excluding the impact of store closures and foreign exchange. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015 came in at $0.89 per share. And if you exclude a $0.04 headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar, our non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year were down about $0.03 versus last year. 
We continue to make good progress on many of our key initiatives in Q4. We grow solid growth in categories beyond office supplies in North American Contract. We improve profitability in Staples.com. We deliver strong growth in our omni-channel offering. We grew copy and print in stores and online. We grew the top line and improved profitability in Australia, New Zealand and China. We continue to right-size our retail network and preserve profitability across the chain. We exceeded our 2-year goal to reduce costs by $500 million. We improved operating margin rate in our North American businesses. And we extended the Office Depot merger agreement and financing arrangements to allow for the completion of ongoing federal court litigation with the Federal Trade Commission. 
Let me give you a little more color on our fourth quarter highlights. And I'll start with North American Contract, where sales were flat in local currency during the fourth quarter. We were up against our toughest comparison of the year in Q4. On a 2-year stacked basis, sales grew 7% in local currency during the fourth quarter, and this was consistent with the 2-year trend we've achieved throughout 2015. 
Over the past few years, we've added nearly 300 specialists to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies, enhanced our contract website and introduced new digital selling tools to our sales team. We continue to benefit from those investments during the fourth quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in breakroom supplies and promotional products and high single-digit growth from facility supplies. In total, contract sales in categories beyond office supplies grew in the low single digits during the fourth quarter and now account for approximately half of our entire contract sales mix. 
In Staples.com, we remain focused on balancing sales growth with profit improvement. During Q4, sales were up 1% in local currency, and operating margin rate increased by more than 100 basis points. We achieved gross margin dollar growth versus Q4 of last year. This year, we had a more targeted approach to driving profitable promotions with small business customers. We also continued to improve customer conversion on our desktop and mobile websites as a result of the investments we've made to improve the user experience. 
Customers continue to embrace our omni-channel offering, which grew double digits during Q4. And for the full year in 2015, we generated nearly $0.5 billion of omni-channel sales through our in-store Staples.com kiosk as well as our click & collect features like Buy Online, Pick Up in Store. During the fourth quarter, we began piloting our newest omni-channel capability, Ship From Store. Ship from Store improves the customer experience, it allows us to manage our inventory more efficiently and positions us for same-day delivery. Early results are encouraging. 
Turning to copy and print. Same-store sales in North America were up in the low single digits during the fourth quarter. Our copy and print account managers continue to drive growth with small and medium business customers. We grow strong traffic to stores through key categories like business cards and signs and banners. We also achieved solid growth in services like shredding and shipping throughout the year. Copy and print is having a growing impact on our business. Today, copy and print represents nearly 10% of our retail sales mix and generates a gross margin rate that is well above the house. 
In our Australia/New Zealand business, we grew the top line and improved the bottom line for the third consecutive quarter. And we've built on our momentum in China, achieving strong, double-digit sales growth and profitability during the fourth quarter. 
In North American stores, we continue to take aggressive action to right-size our store network. During Q4, we closed 12 stores, bringing our total store closures to 242 in North America over the past couple of years. We also continued to improve store productivity. Gross margin dollars per square foot were up year-over-year, and we drove operating margin rate improvement versus Q4 of last year. 
In summary, we got a lot done during the fourth quarter and the full year as we continue to transform Staples. That said, we also came up short on our goals in a few key areas and we have more work to do. In North American Contract, while sales trends were stable on a 2-year stack basis, our plans call for low single-digit sales growth in Q4. The majority of the difference was driven by softer-than-expected macro trends and fewer large customer wins in beyond office supplies categories versus Q4 of last year. 
In North American Stores and Online, customer traffic was weak during the fourth quarter. Some of this headwind was driven by our decision to be less promotional during the holiday season and not to open our stores on Thanksgiving Day. But beyond these headwinds, we continued to face weak traffic in our stores and our desktops website in the United States. 
In Europe, we continue to make progress restructuring the business. Unfortunately, our progress was more than offset by some significant headwinds during Q4. During 2015, we faced pressure from the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on our dollar-denominated product costs. These headwinds have been most pronounced in Europe contract where many of our large customers have fixed-price agreements that didn't allow for us to immediately pass along cost increases. During Q4, these headwinds continued and we didn't have as much success recovering the increased costs as we had planned. The bottom line in Europe was also pressured by customer disruptions from an ERP implementation in our U.K. contract business as well as the highly promotional retail environment during the holidays. 
Despite these headwinds, we did generate a profit in Europe during Q4, but our bottom line results came in below our expectations. 
Better news relates to the investments we've made to reduce cost on a global basis. When we reported our third quarter results, we were on track to hit our 2-year goal of $500 million of annualized cost reductions. As a result of weaker sales in Q4, we made the decision to take out additional cost and also to streamline our organization during the quarter, bringing our 2-year annualized cost reductions to approximately $550 million. 
We had a few goals in streamlining the organization: we wanted to build a simplified structure that will speed up decision making, we wanted to reduce cost and we wanted to improve financial flexibility to pursue our critical objectives in 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, we also made leadership changes to drive these objectives and better position Staples for the future. Shira Goodman was named President, North American Operations. She now has responsibility for our business-to-business, online and retail operations across the United States and Canada. John Wilson was named President of International Operations and Transformation. He now has responsibility for operations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and Asia, and John will also lead the company's strategy and overall transformation efforts. In their new roles, Shira and John will be responsible for driving results against our 2016 company-wide objectives. We'll focus on just 3 critical priorities. And these build on our success over the past few years, and they also address the areas where we've come up short of our goals.  
In 2016, we're completely focused on doing fewer things better, and I'm pleased to report that we expect to get back to earnings growth in 2016. First, we'll accelerate growth in categories beyond office supplies. These categories account for approximately $10 billion of our global sales, which is just under half of our total company sales mix. 
Our growth beyond office supplies will be fueled by a few key categories: cleaning and breakroom supplies, mail and ship supplies and services. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've added hundreds of specialists to drive growth beyond office supplies in our contract business over the past few years. In 2016, we plan to build on this success by adding more than 100 incremental specialists, bringing our total to more than 1,000 contract specialists focused on beyond office supplies growth. 
We'll also expand our assortment in categories beyond office supplies through Staples brand offerings. Customers trust the value and expertise of Staples-branded products in both core categories and also beyond office supplies categories as well. 
Our second objective is to grow our mid-market penetration in contract. There are hundreds of thousands of mid-market customers that we don't serve today. And they're spending billions of dollars a year on the products and services we sell. We're increasing our focus on customer acquisition and retention and also growing our share of wallet. In 2016, we'll increase the size of our mid-market acquisition sales force by more than 20%. We'll strengthen our value proposition with our mid-market loyalty program, which is driving increased spend and greater share, higher retention rates and increased customer engagement. And we'll leverage the strength of our category specialists to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies. Historically, there has been an overlap between our Staples.com and mid-market contract businesses; our new simplified structure will help us better serve these customers. 
And our third priority is to improve traffic, both in stores and online. Weak customer traffic was a significant hurdle for us this last year, and driving customers to our store and online is crucial to our success in 2016. In stores, we're focused on improving customer conversion, accelerating growth in our services business and building our omni-channel momentum. Online, we'll continue to sharpen our pricing, ensure that customers fully understand the value that Staples provides and expand our assortment of products and services. 
These 3 priorities for 2016 are critical for Staples to succeed either as a stand-alone company or combined with Office Depot. 
Before I review our segment results, let me just give you an update on the Office Depot acquisition. 
First of all, our commitment to the acquisition hasn't changed. Our top priority is to get the deal done. The acquisition will position us to better serve the changing needs of business customers and also allow us to compete more effectively against a large and diverse set of competitors. 
During the fourth quarter, the Federal Trade Commission and the Canadian Competition Bureau challenged the acquisition. The FTC's argument is that this transaction would lead to the largest and most powerful companies in the world paying higher prices for sticky notes, pens, pencils, notepads, file folders, paper clips and copy paper, when in fact we have publicly committed to reinvest a significant portion of the merger synergies to lower prices for all customers. 
In addition, the FTC has established an incredibly narrow market definition to fit its narrative. It is only concerned with B2B customers that spend at least $500,000 a year on just these categories, which is a tiny portion of the overall marketplace. In fact, more than 99% of our commercial customers will be unaffected by the merger even based on the FTC's narrow view of the market.  
In reaching its decision, we believe that the FTC is acting against the best interest of hundreds of thousands of business customers and millions of consumers who would benefit from this acquisition. The FTC is also completely ignoring the millions of products beyond office supplies that customers purchase from us, everything from cleaning supplies to breakroom snacks, to furniture and technology. They're also conveniently excluding ink and toner, which is one of our largest core categories, from their market definition. 
The FTC's actions are based on a flawed and very narrow definition of the marketplace and a deep misunderstanding of the competitive landscape. Unfortunately, the FTC completely disregards the disruptive effect of stronger and larger new competitors in the digital economy. 
The FTC's decision also ignores the reasoning in its own unanimous approval of the Office Depot-OfficeMax merger in 2013. At that time, the FTC acknowledged that Staples and Office Depot faced strong competition from a host of competitors. Since 2013, competition has materially intensified, not lessened, including share gains by Amazon and other Internet players, big-box retailers, independent distributors and many others. In an effort to address the FTC's concerns, we proposed divesting up to $1.25 billion of commercial contract business and related assets. The FTC promptly rejected our offer. 
Nevertheless, we continue to make progress on the acquisition. On February 2, we completed the extension of our acquisition financing arrangements and extended the merger agreement from February 4 to May 16. The extension will allow us for the completion of federal court litigation with the FTC. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled to begin on March 21, and we expect a decision by May 10. 
The European Commission announced on February 10 that it has approved the transaction on the condition that we divest Office Depot's European contract business and all of Office Depot's operations in Sweden. We have committed to meet these requirements, and we will also divest Office Depot's retail, online and catalog operations in Europe in connection with closing the merger. We're all -- we are very pleased the -- with the European Commission's approval. I think the acquisition has now been approved in Australia, New Zealand, China and 23 countries in Europe. Regulatory agencies around the world clearly understand the value that this transaction will bring to customers of all sizes. 
We also recently extended -- entered into an agreement with Essendant to divest more than $550 million of office products revenue and related assets, subject to the successful completion of the acquisition. The commercial business and assets being divested relate primarily to accounts where Staples and Office Depot act as wholesalers to minority and women-owned office supply resellers. Approximately half the revenue we plan to divest to Essendant is from Fortune 500 companies, and more than 25% of the revenue is from Fortune 100 companies. 
We remain prepared to hit the ground running with our integration plans once the deal is approved, and we remain committed to our previous target of more than $1 billion of net synergies over the 3-year integration period. And as a reminder, this target is net of investments to provide increased value to our customers. 
In summary, the acquisition of Office Depot is good for customers, it's good for associates and it's good for our shareholders. This has been a surprisingly long and frustrating road, and we look forward to a full and fair judicial review as we fight to complete the acquisition. 
Now, let's take a very quick look at the fourth quarter results for each of our business units. And I'm going to start with the North American Commercial. Their sales were flat year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of changes in FX rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 1% to $2 billion versus last year. And contract sales were also flat on a local currency business -- sorry, basis. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we committed -- we continued to drive good growth in categories beyond office supplies and contract during Q4, we achieved double-digit sales growth in breakroom supplies and promotional products and sales were up in the high single digits in facility supplies. This momentum was offset by modest sales declines in our contract print and technology business. We also felt a headwind in contract furniture where we're up against sales growth of more than 30% in Q4 of last year. Contract sales in core office categories like ink and toner and paper were down in the low single digits, and sales of office supplies increased about 1% versus the prior year.  
During the fourth quarter, North American Commercial operating margin rate increased 57 basis points to 7.6% and operating income grew $10 million. This improvement primarily reflects increased product margin rate and lower incentive compensation expense versus Q4 of last year, and this was partially offset by investments in sales force to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies. 
Turning to North American Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 4%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 9% to $2.4 billion versus Q4 of last year. 
During the fourth quarter, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 4%. This reflects 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 5% decline in same-store sales. Same-store sales were negatively impacted by about 1% as a result of our decision to close our stores on Thanksgiving Day. Results in Canada were stronger than in the U.S. in both stores and online during the fourth quarter. 
From a category perspective, the 5% decline in same-store sales during Q4 was entirely driven by ongoing weakness in technology. Computers, mobility, printing hardware and technology accessories all declined in the double digits. Given the margin characteristics of technology hardware, the impact on the bottom line was not as dramatic as the sales headwind from technology. Outside of technology, same-store sales were about flat during the fourth quarter. This was driven by growth in copy and print and mail and ship supplies and relatively flat sales in office supplies and furniture year-over-year.  
North American Stores and Online operating margin increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 5.1%. This primarily reflects improved product margin rates and lower incentive compensation expense versus Q4 of last year, and this was partially offset by increased delivery expense, increased marketing expense as a percentage of sales and the negative impact of lower sales on fixed cost -- fixed expenses. 
Turning to International Operations. Sales decreased 1%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 12% year-over-year to $791 million versus Q4 of last year. 
In our contract business in Europe, local currency sales were down in the mid-single digits during the fourth quarter. In Europe retail, same-store sales declined 11% during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a decrease in customer traffic versus Q4 of last year. And that's largely due to our less promotional approach during the holiday season. And in our European online business, local currency sales were down in the low single digits. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we continue to make great progress driving year-over-year growth and improved profitability in Australia, New Zealand and China. These improvements once again helped to offset some of the pressures we've been experiencing in Europe. 
On the bottom line, International Operations was about breakeven for the fourth quarter. Operating margin rate decreased 212 basis points compared to Q4 of last year. This decrease primarily reflects lower product margin rate in Europe contract and the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses in Europe, partially offset by improved profitability in Australia, in China and in South America. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our financials."

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined 2% versus Q4 of last year. This excludes a 4% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from stores we closed in North America during the past year. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 7% versus Q4 of last year. 
During the fourth quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.26. This was at the lower end of our guidance and it excludes pretax charges of $172 million primarily related to the restructuring and the acquisition of Office Depot as well as the impact of certain tax items. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported net earnings of $0.13 per share. 
Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased 6 basis points to 26.2% versus Q4 of the last year. This primarily reflects product margin rate increases in  North American Stores and Online, partially offset by lower product margin rate in Europe as well as increased delivery costs in North American Stores and Online. 
During the fourth quarter, total company SG&A decreased $85 million year-over-year after excluding a $36 million charge in Q4 of this year primarily related to the acquisition of Office Depot and the previously announced data security incident, as well as $5 million of accelerated depreciation during the fourth quarter last year. This reflects the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and aggressive cost management across the company as a percentage of sales, SG&A, excluding charges, decreased 7 basis points to 20.9%. 
In Q4, we wrapped up our 2-year cost reduction program. As Ron mentioned, we did respond to softer-than-expected sales and earnings during the fourth quarter by taking aggressive actions to streamline our organization. As a result, we eliminated more than 1,000 jobs across the company in Q4, bringing our 2-year annualized cost take-out to approximately $550 million. 
Over the past 2 years, we've had great success reducing product costs, eliminating expenses in our retail stores, driving efficiencies in the supply chain and streamlining our European operations. Most importantly, we have changed the way we work. The lessons we've learned set us up extremely well to continue driving cost efficiencies across the organization in 2016 and beyond. 
Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate was flat year-over-year at 5.1%. 
Turning to our Q4 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges and certain discrete items, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28.6% in Q4 of 2014. During Q4 of last year, Congress extended certain provisions in the U.S. tax code that allowed for federal wage tax credits and the deferral of income on certain foreign earnings. This drove the favorability in last year's fourth quarter effective tax rate and resulted in a $0.02 tailwind to Q4 2014 diluted earnings per share. During Q4 of 2015, Congress extended the same provisions as last year, but the favorable impact was offset by the year-over-year change in our geographic mix of earnings. 
In 2016, we are planning for our effective tax rate to be approximately 35.5%. We expect the modest year-over-year increase to be primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
Year-to-date, capital expenditures came in at $381 million, an increase of $20 million versus the prior year. 
With operating cash flow of $978 million, we generated free cash flow of $597 million in 2015, which was in line with our expectations. 
Throughout 2015, we carefully managed working capital. And at the end of the year, our AP-to-inventory ratio improved 91% versus 87% at the end of 2014. 
We continue to focus on building cash ahead of the Office Depot acquisition. And as a result, we did not purchase any shares during 2015.
 
At the end of 2015, Staples had approximately $1.9 billion in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $825 million and available lines of credit of about $1.1 billion. 
During 2015, we returned $308 million, or about half of our free cash flow, to shareholders through our cash dividend. We remain committed to maintaining our current quarterly dividend. And earlier this week, we announced a Q1 2016 cash dividend of $0.12 per share. 
Now turning to our outlook. As Ron mentioned earlier, we do expect to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decrease versus Q1 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our delivery businesses in North America. We will be -- this will be offset by ongoing weaknesses in technology and our retail stores, moderating headwinds from our stronger U.S. dollar as well as store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from -- in the range of $0.16 to $0.18. Our earnings guidance excludes any potential costs related to the company's planned acquisition of Office Depot and the impact related to ongoing store closures. 
We expect to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016, and our cash flow guidance excludes financing payments related to the acquisition of Office Depot. 
In 2016, we plan to close approximately 50 retail stores in North America. This will bring our total store closures to nearly 300 since the beginning of 2014. 
I'll now turn it back over to Joyce, our conference call moderator, for Q&A."

We have been working really hard for the last 3 years kind of investing in many areas of the business to improve them and position them for profitable growth. As I mentioned, we really only have 3 objectives this year: we're going to grow the mid-market, our most profitable part of our contract business; we're going to grow BOSS growth because that's where the growth is compared to historically, the office supplies is not growing like BOSS has been growing; and we're going to focus on traffic, and I think we're -- we'll see some improvements in both retail and online traffic as a result of that focus. Now your question's a good one. How do you pay for all this new stuff if you're adding sales people and you're adding contract specialists, et cetera? All I can tell you is that we're pretty good at reducing expenses. We know how to do that. We've also kind of streamlined the organization. We've changed the way we're working across the organization. And I think in 2016, we expect to pursue additional opportunities to reduce our cost. We took out $200 million in 2013. We took out another $250 million in 2014. And the year we just announced, we took out $300 million. And I think we'll continue to take out cost to support the investments as well as provide the context to profitable growth and earnings growth that we've just talked about this morning in 2016. So we'll manage that very carefully, but we do anticipate growing our earnings this year."

And so when we broke that apart, it was primarily due to some very atypical number of BOSS wins in the prior year as well as a little bit on macro trends but primarily the atypical BOSS wins. It's also worth noting that our gap versus Office Depot has really remained constant over time. And if anything, it's accelerating a tad. Regarding the independent dealers, we don't have a sense really that they're gaining share. One of our best indicators is looking at Essendant and SP Richards. And while I think the dealers are shifting between which wholesaler they use, and that's driving some different sales momentum across the 2 wholesalers, we're not seeing a lot of evidence of share gain amongst the independent dealers."

So I wouldn't necessarily think about changing our entire direction based on the 2015 results. We certainly have the foreign exchange changes now flowing to our -- both our costs and we're renegotiating and breaking contracts where needed to recover those costs as quickly as we can. So I think we're on a good trajectory in 2016 to recover the FX impacts. And I also believe we've got our new ERP system stabilized. We're running consistently for the last month at 95% fill rates within 24 hours. So I think we had challenges in '16 and we've made real progress.

I would say probably the biggest metric on that is the secular decline and the headwind that, that gives us. In a nice way, actually, our supply business has really held up, and a lot of that is because our customer acquisition has been strong throughout the year. So that has really held up. But overall, it is the pressure of secular decline, which is why our strategy to drive growth through the beyond office supplies categories is so critical and why we're investing in the things like spatulets [ph], digital selling aids, et cetera, so that we have the expertise necessary to drive costs in that area."

And those are categories which by and large have some growth in them where we have very, very little market share and where we have shown an ability to gain share. And from a customer's perspective, the real value add there is the vendor consolidation and their ability to go to one website and get everything delivered in one order.

And it just so happens, as luck had it last year, we had an atypical number of them in Q4, which we were now anniversary-ing this year. So we do believe that there is a lot of runway with our beyond office supplies category. It's obviously for our larger customers but also increasingly for our mid-market customers. One of our biggest challenges and something that the team is really making incredible progress on is how do you sell what we call the BOSS categories to mid-market customers where the economics of bringing in in-person experts does not work, bringing that to a smaller office. And so they've really developed a model, with the combination of digital selling aids as well as virtual specialists, we can bring the expertise necessary to sell these categories to really any size company.

So we have tens of thousands of them who are current contract customers, but we have hundreds of thousands of companies of this size. And I'm talking about companies roughly 10 to 250 employees who shop Staples either through our stores and online. So they like Staples, they know Staples, they shop Staples but often as a secondary or tertiary supplier. And we think we can use our existing relationships with those customers, and they just don't even know that we have a business unit like contract that can better serve their needs, giving them the customized pricing and the personalized experience, that product expertise that they really know. And I think in doing that, we will grab share from a lot of folks out there in the market. We'll grab it from the dealer community. We'll grab it from retailers for things like breakroom.

This morning, we announced our first quarter results that were right in line with our expectations. Before I discuss Q1 in more detail, I'd like to start off by covering some recent headlines relating to 2 topics: One is our attempted acquisition of Office Depot; and two is our strategic plan going forward. I think everybody on the call knows that last week, the U.S. District Court, the District of Columbia, granted the FTC's request to block our acquisition of Office Depot. We were disappointed that the FTC's request was granted despite the fact that, in our view, it failed to define the relative -- the relevant market correctly and fell short of proving its case. The FTC excluded ink and toner from the market definition of consumable office supplies. The only focused on Fortune 100 customers and acknowledge that there were no concerns about any harm to consumers or small or medium businesses. The FTC ignored the competitive threat from Amazon business and a host of other competitors, and also encouraged witnesses to say things that weren't true to bolster their case. 
We're also disappointed that our proposed remedies to satisfy the FTC's concerns were unsuccessful, and that our commitment to invest a significant portion of the synergies and lower prices for all customers was not heard. 
We pursued the Office Depot acquisition to provide increased value to customers to compete more effectively against the large and diverse set of competitors and to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Over the past 20 months, we've committed a lot of time and resources to getting the deal done. Given the additional time and resources we'd have to commit to pursue an appeal, we have determined that it's in the best interest of our shareholders to forego appealing the court's ruling. 
Earlier this week, we terminated the merger agreement with Office Depot, and we will pay the $250 million breakout fee tomorrow. Our divestiture agreement with Essendant also terminated in connection with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. And finally, I just like to thank Office Depot and Essendant for their hard work and for the collaboration as we pursued this transaction. 
We're now focused on moving forward, and we're focused on executing our strategic plan to drive shareholder value, or what we're referring to internally as Staples 2020. This plan builds on our reinvention successes over the past few years, and it is supported by our strongest competitive advantages. We've had good success driving growth in categories beyond office supplies and in growing our mid-market contract business. We've also been challenged by weak results in Europe and in North American stores. We're confident that by narrowing our focus, more aggressively pursuing our best opportunities, accelerating growth in our asset-light businesses and pulling back in areas with less potential, we can get back to sustainable long-term sales and earnings growth and significantly improve return on net assets. 
Our strategic plan includes 4 key priorities. First, we're focusing on winning with mid-market customers in North America by accelerating growth in services and products beyond office supplies. Second, we're reshaping Staples by narrowing our focus in North America, rightsizing our retail network and exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. Third, we're taking aggressive action to reduce cost and drive efficiency further across the organization. And fourth, we're continuing to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
2 months ago, we streamlined the organization to build a simplified structure, speed up decision-making and provide flexibility to invest in our critical strategic objectives. The changes we've made has set us up for success. With Shira Goodman leading our North American operations and John Wilson overseeing our international operations and our strategic planning and transformation efforts, I'm confident that we have the right team in place to win with customers. 
Over the next 3 years, we'll dramatically change the profile of Staples as we position our company for the future. More than 95% of our sales will come from North America versus about 85% today. About 80% of our sales will be delivery versus 60% today, and sales beyond office supplies will account for more than 60% of our revenue versus less than 50% today. 
Let me take a few minutes to give you a little more color on each of our 4 priorities. First, winning with mid-market customers in North America. We define the mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees. This is our highly profitable and highly fragmented customer segment, and today, we have very low share with mid-market customers in categories beyond office supplies. The needs of those mid-market customers align closely with our strengths. These customers need a wide assortment of products and services, the support of category specialist who have expertise and easy online shopping experience as well as quick and reliable delivery. We have expertise in a wide range of product and services. We have a world-class supply chain and next-day delivery capability. Our digital expertise provides a differentiated customer experience. We have a new mid-market loyalty program that is driving increased spend, high retention rates and increased customer engagement. And we recently rebranded our B2B division, Staples Business Advantage, to emphasize the many advantages that we can provide to those business customers. 
To accelerate growth in mid-market, we've developed a strong customer-focused plan that builds on these strengths. Our plan focuses on increasing our share of wallet with hundreds of thousands of midmarket customers we share today and on acquiring many of the mid-market customers that we don't currently serve. We're increasing our offering of products and services beyond office supplies and pursuing market share gains in core categories like office supplies, ink, toner and paper. We're investing in sharper pricing and enhanced supply chain capabilities. We're dramatically expanding the size of our mid-market sales force with the addition of more than 1,000 new sales reps. And we're also pursuing acquisitions of B2B service providers in companies, specializing in categories beyond office supplies. In summary, we're helping small or mid-market customers compete like a Fortune 500 company. 
Second, we're reshaping Staples to reduce risk and preserve profitability. John Wilson and the leadership team in Europe have worked tirelessly to streamline and stabilized Europe over the past few years. While we believe there is a significant opportunity to generate a value in the highly fragmented European market, we also recognize that our best growth opportunities are in North America, and that these are our primary focus. As a result, we've decided to explore strategic alternatives for European operations. Over the coming weeks, we plan to meet with a potential buyers of our European operations, and we will provide more details on timing and valuation as we work through these processes. 
We also remain committed to increasing productivity and preserving profitability in our North American retail stores. We have closed more than 300 stores and reduced our lease obligations by more than $1 billion in North America since 2011. We've also aggressively managed our lease renewal processes. Today, our average remaining lease life in North America is about 3.5 years per store. That's a reduction of more than 40% since 2011. We've challenged the retail stores team to do more with less, and they have delivered. Customer service stores remains strong, and customer conversion is at an all-time high. We will remain laser focused on these metrics going forward. We'll also continue to rightsize our retail store portfolio in North America by closing at least 50 stores this year. 
In addition to closing unproductive stores, we'll continue to build on the strength of our omni-channel capabilities and services like copy and print. We believe our store provides convenience and immediacy that is valued by customers of all sizes, including mid-market customers. 
Our third priority is to aggressively reduce cost across the company to drive efficiency and fund our growth investments. Over the past 3 years, we've generated approximately $750 million of annualized pretax cost savings by evolving the business processes, increasing productivity and developing more efficient ways to save customers. Last week, we announced the new multi-year cost-savings plan, which is expected to generate an additional $300 million of annualized pretax cost savings by the end of 2018. We're focused on reducing product costs, optimizing promotions, increasing the mix of Staples brand products and reducing operating expenses. We'll also continue to reduce cost in retail stores as we rightsize our store network. 
Our fourth priority is to continue returning cash to shareholders. We remain committed to our ongoing cash dividend program. We plan to resume repurchasing our common stock through open market purchases during the second quarter of 2016. We're currently planning for share repurchases of approximately $100 million in 2016. 
As the industry leader, we pursue the acquisition of Office Depot from a position of strength. We're now pursuing our strategic plan from a similar position. We are dramatically reshaping our business, while increasing our focus on categories beyond office supplies and evolving to meet the changing needs of mid-market customers. We are reducing our exposure to underperforming businesses, and we are reiterating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Total company sales for Q1 were down about 1% year-over-year, excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP operating income rate in dollars improved versus Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.17 was flat versus Q1 of last year. 
On our Q4 earnings call, we talked about our key priorities for '16, which are now a critical part of our strategic plan. Let me take a few minutes to give you some color on our progress during the first quarter. One of our top priorities is to accelerate growth in categories beyond office supplies. Today, nearly half of our sales are generated beyond office supplies, and business customers are increasingly relying on Staples to provide them with wider assortment of products and services. The market for these categories is highly fragmented, and we're wining with business customers of all sizes by providing a differentiated level of service and expertise. 
During Q1, North American Contract continue to lead the way here with growth in promotional products, facility supplies, breakroom supplies, technology and furniture. We also grew key categories beyond office supplies in  North American Stores & Online during Q1 with comparable sales growth in furniture, facility supplies, copy and print, mail and ship and breakroom supplies. Another priority is to grow our mid-market penetration in Contract. During Q1, we grew North American Contract sales by 2% in local currency. Our strongest momentum was in the mid-market where sales were up in the mid-single digits driven by sales beyond office supplies, which is up about 10% year-over-year. Improved customer acquisition and retention offset modestly lower sales to existing customers, and this was supported by additional mid-market sales reps that we hired during Q1 as well as continued strong performance in our mid-market membership program. We also narrowed the focus on our best growth opportunities in contract during the first quarter with the announcement of our intention to sell our contract print manufacturing and operations business to Taylor Corporation. We acquired the contract print business when we bought Corporate Express in 2008. As we increase our focus on growing our asset-light businesses and improving return on net assets, it made sense for us to part ways with contract print. At Staples, we lack the scale and manufacturing expertise that this business requires. The business is also very capital intensive, generates an operating margin below the house and generates return on net assets below our cost of capital. 
While business is not a great fit in the Staples portfolio, it's a perfect fit for Taylor. We expect the deal to close during the second quarter. We look forward to continuing to offer a wide assortment of print solutions to our contract customers through vendor partnerships and our own in-store print capability. 
We're also focused on improving traffic, both in-store and online. Results here have been mixed during the first quarter. In Canada, traffic in stores and online increased year-over-year, and we improved customer conversion. In the United States, we also improved customer conversion in stores and online, but this was not enough to offset lower customer traffic across both channels. We remain committed to improving customer traffic online and conversion in stores. A few weeks ago, we launched the new unbeatable prices for ink and toner. And while it's still early, I'm pleased to report that customer feedback has been very positive, and we see a nice improvement in online traffic in the U.S. during the first few weeks of Q2. We know this is the right decision to improve price perception while driving business customer acquisition and retention over the long term. 
Over the past few years, we've had success driving growth in categories beyond office supplies, growing our mid-market contract business and providing better value for our customers by investing lower prices. Our momentum continued during the first quarter. Our strategic plan is supported by our strongest competitive advantages and builds on these successes. We're confident that by narrowing our focus and more aggressively pursuing our best opportunities will speed up our transformation, while positioning Staples for sustainable long-term sales and earnings growth. 
Let's take a quick look at first quarter results from each of our business units. I'm going to start with North American commercial. Here, sales were up 1% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP pieces, sales in U.S. dollar were flat versus Q1 of last year at $2.1 billion. In contract sales grew 2% local currency during the quarter. 
As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we continue to drive strong growth in categories beyond office supplies and contract during the first quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in promotional products and breakroom supplies, and sales were up in high single digits in facility supplies. Contract sales in core categories like ink and toner and paper were down in the low to mid-single-digits, and sales of office supplies were flat versus Q1 of 2015. 
During the first quarter, North American commercial operating margin increased 63 basis points to 7%, and operating income grew by approximately $14 million or about 10% year-over-year. This improvement primarily reflects lower labor cost and reduced marketing expense. 
We expect the divestiture of Staples Print Solutions to close over the coming weeks. And as a result of the sale, we're planning for about a 4% headwind to our reported North American commercial sales and about a 2% headwind to our reported total company sales over the next year. 
Turning to  North American Stores & Online. Sales declined approximately 2%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales were down 5% to $2.2 billion versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, combined  North American Stores & Online comparable sales declined by 3%. This reflects a 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 4% decline in same-store sales. Results in Canada were stronger than the U.S. in both stores and online during the first quarter. 
From a category perspective, the 3% decline in comparable sales during Q1 was highly driven by ongoing weakness in technology as well as weakness in ink and toner. In technology, tablets and technology accessories were our weakest category with double-digit decline year-over-year. Ink and toner were down low single digits. Outside of technology and ink and toner, comparable sales in stores and online grew during the first quarter. This growth was driven by furniture, office supplies, facility supplies and copy and print.  
North American Stores & Online operating margin decreased 40 basis points year-over-year to 2.8%. This primarily reflect the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses as well as lower product margins at Staples.com versus Q1 of last year. This was partially offset by reduced marketing expense, improved retail product margin rate and savings related to reduction in headcount. 
We continue to rightsize our retail store network in North America. During the quarter, we closed 14 stores in the United States, ending Q1 with 1,288 stores in the United States and 305 stores in Canada. We've now closed 256 stores or about 14% of the North American chain since 2014. 
Finally, turning to international operations. Sales here decreased 3%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 6% year-over-year to $738 million versus Q1 of last year. In Europe retail, same-store sales declined 9% during the first quarter driven primarily by decrease in customer traffic versus Q1. In our contract business in Europe, local currency sales were down in the high single digit during the first quarter. In our European online business, local currency sales were down in the low single digits. Despite the weak sales trends in Europe during the first quarter, John Wilson and his team in Europe did a great job aggressively managing expenses and, in fact, drove improved profitability year-over-year. 
Outside of Europe, we continue to drive solid growth in China during Q1 with sales up in the strong double-digit range in local currency versus Q1 of last year. We also continued to make progress improving the bottom line in Australia and New Zealand as well as China. On the bottom line, international operating rate margin rate improved 13 basis points versus Q1 of last year to an operating loss of 2.4%, and this was driven by year-over-year improvement in Australia, China and in Europe. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Christine to review our financial results. Christine?"

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined 1% versus Q1 of last year. This excludes a 1% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from stores we closed in North America during the past year. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 3% versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.17, which was unchanged versus Q1 of last year. Our Q1 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $66 million primarily related to cost associated with the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and store closures. It also excludes a pretax charge of $32 million related to the pending sale of Staples Print Solutions. On a GAAP basis, we reported net earnings of $0.06 per share. Gross profit margin for the first quarter decreased 33 basis points to 25.3% versus Q1 of last year. This primarily reflects lower product margin rate in international operations, and it was partially offset by improved product margin in North American stores. 
During the first quarter, total company SG&A decreased $59 million year-over-year after, after excluding a $24 million charge in Q1 of this year primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot, $11 million of acquisition-related costs and $4 million of accelerated depreciation during Q1 of last year. This reflects lower labor cost due to headcount reductions and store closures, lower marketing expense and a favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. As a percentage of sales, SG&A, excluding charges, decreased 44 basis points to 21.5%. 
Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 3.4%. 
Turning to our Q1 tax rate, excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q1 of 2015. This modest year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. Q1 capital expenditures came in at $44 million, a decrease of $16 million versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $276 million, we generated free cash flow of $232 million during the first quarter. During the first quarter, we did make cash payments of $69 million related to the Office Depot financing commitment fees earned by our lenders in 2015. If you exclude the negative impact of these payments, our first quarter free cash flow came in at $301 million. At the end of Q1, Staples had approximately $2 billion in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $946 million and available lines of credits of about $1.1 billion. 
As Ron mentioned at the beginning of the call, one of our top priorities is to continue returning excess cash to shareholders. We returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually through cash dividends, and we remain committed to our dividend program. We also plan to resume share repurchases during Q2. Our current forecast is for about $100 million of share repurchases in 2016. As a result, we plan to return approximately $400 million to shareholders this year through dividends and repurchases. 
Now turning to our outlook. We remain on track to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the second quarter, we expect total company sales to decrease versus Q2 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and our contract businesses in North America. This will be offset by the headwind related to the sale of Staples Print Solutions as well as ongoing weaknesses in technology in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.13. Our earnings guidance excludes remaining costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and the impact of ongoing store closures as well as the negative impact of the Office Depot breakup fee. We expect to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the impact of cash payments related to acquisition financing as well as the impact of the breakup fee that we will pay Office Depot this week.  In 2016, we plan to close at least 50 retail stores in North America. 
Over time, our strategic plan will drive improvement in both the top line and the bottom line. We will experience sales pressures as we explore strategic alternatives in Europe and as we continue to close retail stores in North America. These headwinds will be offset by mid-market growth, fueled by the categories beyond office supplies. We expect to get back to sustainable earnings growth as we reshape Staples and resume our repurchase program. We also expect Staples free cash flow and a significant improvement in return on net asset as we increase our focus on asset-light businesses, and reduce our exposure for our weakest performing businesses. 
I'll now turn it back over to our conference call moderator for Q&A."

If you look at some of the largest companies in America, I mean, they're already buying very, very well. When you look at our online business, our retail business, I think there are some items that are -- we remain too high at. Online, a couple of weeks ago, we announced kind of very significant reductions in prices on ink and toner, which is the most sensitive item or one of the most price sensitive items for our customers. So I think our goal is to get close to anybody out there and the price-sensitive items. I'm not saying they have to be the absolute lowest, but I think you've got to be within shouting distance. And particularly, when you think about some of the other things that retail offers, there are some advantages of retail that maybe customers don't like expect you to be absolute lowest, but the other things that retail offers allows you to be a maybe slightly higher. So I think we look at pricing like everybody else does. We look at price sensitive items, we look at the elasticity of those, we look at the things that are kind of medium and, and we look at things that are not elastic at all. But I think, in general, over the last 3 years, part of the investment that we've made this result of the cost takeout has been to lower prices. And I think we still have a ways to go. And then finally, once you get into the contract area, you're negotiating prices item by item, in terms of off contract or on contract, and I'm not sure there's a lot more to be done there as we're pretty aggressively priced in the contracts side of our business already."

This morning, we announced our first quarter results that were right in line with our expectations. 
Before I discuss Q1 in more detail, I'd like to start off by covering some recent headlines relating to 2 topics: one is our attempted acquisition of Office Depot; and two is our strategic plan going forward. I think everybody on the call knows that last week, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the FTC's request to block our acquisition of Office Depot. We were disappointed that the FTC's request was granted despite the fact that, in our view, it failed to define the relative -- the relevant market correctly and fell short of proving its case. The FTC excluded ink and toner from the market definition of consumable office supplies. They only focused on Fortune 100 customers and acknowledged that there were no concerns about any harm to consumers or small or medium businesses. The FTC ignored the competitive threat from Amazon business and a host of other competitors and also encouraged witnesses to say things that weren't true to bolster their case. 
We're also disappointed that our proposed remedies to satisfy the FTC's concerns were unsuccessful, and that our commitment to invest a significant portion of the synergies and lower prices for all customers was not heard. 
We pursued the Office Depot acquisition to provide increased value to customers to compete more effectively against the large and diverse set of competitors and to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Over the past 20 months, we've committed a lot of time and resources to getting the deal done. Given the additional time and resources we'd have to commit to pursue an appeal, we have determined that it's in the best interest of our shareholders to forego appealing the court's ruling. Earlier this week, we terminated the merger agreement with Office Depot and we will pay the $250 million breakout fee tomorrow. Our divestiture agreement with Essendant also terminated in connection with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. And finally, I'd just like to thank both Office Depot and Essendant for their hard work and for their collaboration as we pursued this transaction. 
We're now focused on moving forward and we're focused on executing our strategic plan to drive shareholder value or what we're referring to internally as Staples 2020. This plan builds on our reinvention successes over the past few years and it is supported by our strongest competitive advantages. We've had good success driving growth in categories beyond office supplies and in growing our mid-market contract business. We've also been challenged by weak results in Europe and in North American stores. We're confident that by narrowing our focus, more aggressively pursuing our best opportunities, accelerating growth in our asset-light businesses and pulling back in areas with less potential, we can get back to sustainable long-term sales and earnings growth and significantly improve return on net assets. 
Our strategic plan includes 4 key priorities. First, we're focusing on winning with mid-market customers in North America by accelerating growth in services and products beyond office supplies. Second, we're reshaping Staples by narrowing our focus in North America, rightsizing our retail network and exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. Third, we're taking aggressive action to reduce costs and drive efficiency further across the organization. And fourth, we're continuing to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Two months ago, we streamlined our organization to build a simplified structure, speed up decision-making and provide flexibility to invest in our critical strategic objectives. The changes we've made has set us up for success. With Shira Goodman leading our North American operations and John Wilson overseeing our International Operations and our strategic planning and transformation efforts, I'm confident that we have the right team in place to win with customers. 
Over the next 3 years, we'll dramatically change the profile of Staples as we position our company for the future. More than 95% of our sales will come from North America versus about 85% today. About 80% of our sales will be Delivery versus 60% today. And sales beyond office supplies will account for more than 60% of our revenue versus less than 50% today. 
Let me take a few minutes to give you a little more color on each of our 4 priorities. First, winning with mid-market customers in North America. We define the mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees. This is a highly profitable and highly fragmented customer segment, and today, we have very low share with mid-market customers in categories beyond office supplies. The needs of those mid-market customers align closely with our strengths. These customers need a wide assortment of products and services, the support of category specialists who have expertise and easy online shopping experience as well as quick and reliable delivery. 
We have expertise in a wide range of product and services. We have a world-class supply chain and next-day delivery capability. Our digital expertise provides a differentiated customer experience. We have a new mid-market loyalty program that is driving increased spend, high retention rates and increased customer engagement. And we recently rebranded our B2B division, Staples Business Advantage, to emphasize the many advantages that we can provide to those business customers. 
To accelerate growth in the mid-market, we developed a strong customer-focused plan that builds on these strengths. Our plan focuses on increasing our share of wallet with the hundreds of thousands of mid-market customers we serve today and on acquiring many of the mid-market customers that we don't currently serve. We're increasing our offering of products and services beyond office supplies and pursuing market share gains in core categories like office supplies, ink, toner and paper. We're investing in sharper pricing and enhanced supply chain capabilities. We're dramatically expanding the size of our mid-market sales force with the addition of more than 1,000 new sales reps. And we're also pursuing acquisitions of B2B service providers and companies specializing in categories beyond office supplies. In summary, we're helping small or mid-market customers compete like a Fortune 500 company. 
Second, we're reshaping Staples to reduce risk and preserve profitability. John Wilson and the leadership team in Europe have worked tirelessly to streamline and stabilized Europe over the past few years. While we believe there's a significant opportunity to generate value in the highly fragmented European market, we also recognize that our best growth opportunities are in North America and that these are our primary focus. As a result, we've decided to explore strategic alternatives for our European operations. Over the coming weeks, we plan to meet with a potential buyers of our European operations and we will provide more details on timing and valuation as we work through this process. 
We also remain committed to increasing productivity and preserving profitability in our North American retail stores. We have closed more than 300 stores and reduced our lease obligations by more than $1 billion in North America since 2011. We've also aggressively managed our lease renewal process. Today, our average remaining lease life in North America is about 3.5 years per store. That's a reduction of more than 40% since 2011. We've challenged the retail stores team to do more with less, and they have delivered. Customer service scores remain strong and customer conversion is at an all-time high. We will remain laser-focused on these metrics going forward. We'll also continue to rightsize our retail store portfolio in North America by closing at least 50 stores this year. In addition to closing unproductive stores, we'll continue to build on the strength of our omnichannel capabilities and services like copy and print. We believe our stores provide convenience and immediacy that is valued by customers of all sizes including mid-market customers. 
Our third priority is to aggressively reduce cost across the company to drive efficiency and fund our growth investments. Over the past 3 years, we've generated approximately $750 million of annualized pretax cost savings by evolving the business processes, increasing productivity and developing more efficient ways to serve customers. Last week, we announced a new multi-year cost-savings plan, which is expected to generate an additional $300 million of annualized pretax cost savings by the end of 2018. We're focused on reducing product costs, optimizing promotions, increasing the mix of Staples brand products and reducing operating expenses. We'll also continue to reduce costs in retail stores as we rightsize our store network. 
Our fourth priority is to continue returning cash to shareholders. We remain committed to our ongoing cash dividend program. We plan to resume repurchasing our common stock through open market purchases during the second quarter of 2016. We're currently planning for share repurchases of approximately $100 million in 2016. 
As the industry leader, we pursue the acquisition of Office Depot from a position of strength. We're now pursuing our strategic plan from a similar position. We are dramatically reshaping our business while increasing our focus on categories beyond office supplies and evolving to meet the changing needs of mid-market customers. We are reducing our exposure to underperforming businesses, and we are reiterating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Total company sales for Q1 were down about 1% year-over-year excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP operating income rate in dollars improved versus Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.17 was flat versus Q1 of last year. 
On our Q4 earnings call, we talked about our key priorities for '16, which are now a critical part of our strategic plan. Let me take a few minutes to give you some color on our progress during the first quarter. One of our top priorities is to accelerate growth in categories beyond office supplies. Today, nearly half of our sales are generated beyond office supplies, and business customers are increasingly relying on Staples to provide them with wider assortment of products and services. The market for these categories is highly fragmented and we're winning with business customers of all sizes by providing a differentiated level of service and expertise. During Q1, North American contract continued to lead the way here with growth in promotional products, facility supplies, break room supplies, technology and furniture. We also grew key categories beyond office supplies in  North American Stores and Online during Q1 with comparable sales growth in furniture, facility supplies, copy and print, mail and ship and break room supplies. 
Another priority is to grow our mid-market penetration in contract. During Q1, we grew North American contract sales by 2% in local currency. Our strongest momentum was in the mid-market where sales were up in the mid-single digits driven by sales beyond office supplies, which is up about 10% year-over-year. Improved customer acquisition and retention offset modestly lower sales to existing customers and this was supported by additional mid-market sales reps that we hired during Q1 as well as continued strong performance in our mid-market membership program. 
We also narrowed the focus on our best growth opportunities in contract during the first quarter with the announcement of our intention to sell our contract print manufacturing and operations business to Taylor Corporation. We acquired the contract print business when we bought Corporate Express in 2008. As we increase our focus on growing our asset-light businesses and improving return on net assets, it made sense for us to part ways with contract print. At Staples, we lack the scale and manufacturing expertise that this business requires. The business is also very capital-intensive, generates an operating margin below the house and generates return on net assets below our cost of capital. While this business isn't a great fit in the Staples portfolio, it's a perfect fit for Taylor. We expect the deal to close during the second quarter. We look forward to continuing to offer a wide assortment of print solutions to our contract customers through vendor partnerships and our own in-store printing capability. 
We're also focused on improving traffic, both in-store and online. Results here have been mixed during the first quarter. In Canada, traffic in stores and online increased year-over-year and we improved customer conversion. In the United States, we also improved customer conversion in stores and online, but this was not enough to offset lower customer traffic across both channels. We remain committed to improving customer traffic online and conversion in stores. A few weeks ago, we launched the new unbeatable prices for ink and toner, and while it's still early, I'm pleased to report that customer feedback has been very positive and we've seen a nice improvement in online traffic in the U.S. during the first few weeks of Q2. We know this is the right decision to improve price perception while driving business customer acquisition and retention over the long term. 
Over the past few years, we've had success driving growth in categories beyond office supplies, growing our mid-market contract business and providing better value for our customers by investing lower prices. Our momentum continued during the first quarter. Our strategic plan is supported by our strongest competitive advantages and builds on these successes. We're confident that by narrowing our focus and more aggressively pursuing our best opportunities will speed up our transformation while positioning Staples for sustainable long-term sales and earnings growth. 
Let's take a quick look at first quarter results from each of our business units, I'm going to start with North American Commercial. Here, sales were up 1% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollar were flat versus Q1 of last year at $2.1 billion, and contract sales grew 2% local currency during the quarter. 
As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we continued to drive strong growth in categories beyond office supplies and contract during the first quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in promotional products and break room supplies and sales were up in the high single digits in facility supplies. Contract sales in core categories like ink and toner and paper were down in the low to mid-single digits and sales of office supplies were flat versus Q1 of 2015. 
During the first quarter, North American Commercial operating margin increased 63 basis points to 7% and operating income grew by approximately $14 million or about 10% year-over-year. This improvement primarily reflects lower labor costs and reduced marketing expense. 
We expect the divestiture of Staples Print Solutions to close over the coming weeks, and as a result of the sale, we're planning for about a 4% headwind to our reported North American Commercial sales and about a 2% headwind to our reported total company sales over the next year. 
Turning to North American Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 2% excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales were down 5% to $2.2 billion versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 3%. This reflects a 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 4% decline in same-store sales. Results in Canada were stronger than the U.S. in both stores and online during the first quarter. 
From a category perspective, the 3% decline in comparable sales during Q1 was entirely driven by ongoing weakness in technology as well as weakness in ink and toner. In technology, tablets and technology accessories were our weakest categories with double-digit declines year-over-year. Ink and toner was down in the low single digits. Outside of technology and ink and toner, comparable sales in Stores and Online grew during the first quarter. This growth was driven by furniture, office supplies, facility supplies and copy and print.  
North American Stores and Online operating margin decreased 40 basis points year-over-year to 2.8%. This primarily reflects the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses as well as lower product margins at Staples.com versus Q1 of last year. This was partially offset by reduced marketing expense, improved retail product margin rate and savings related to reduction in headcount. 
We continued to rightsize our retail store network in North America. During the quarter, we closed 14 stores in the United States, ending Q1 with 1,288 stores in the United States and 305 stores in Canada. We've now closed 256 stores or about 14% of the North American chain since 2014. 
Finally, turning to International Operations. Sales here decreased 3%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 6% year-over-year to $738 million versus Q1 of last year. In Europe retail, same-store sales declined 9% during the first quarter driven primarily by decrease in customer traffic versus Q1. In our contract business in Europe, local currency sales were down in the high single digits during the first quarter. In our European online business, local currency sales were down in the low single digits. Despite the weak sales trends in Europe during the first quarter, John Wilson and his team in Europe did a great job aggressively managing expenses, and in fact, drove improved profitability year-over-year. 
Outside of Europe, we continued to drive solid growth in China during Q1 with sales up in the strong double-digit range in local currency versus Q1 of last year. We also continued to make progress improving the bottom line in Australia, New Zealand as well as China. 
On the bottom line, International operating rate -- margin rate improved 13 basis points versus Q1 of last year to an operating loss of 2.4%, and this was driven by year-over-year improvement in Australia, China and in Europe. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Christine to review our financial results. Christine?"

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined 1% versus Q1 of last year. This excludes a 1% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from stores we closed in North America during the past year. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 3% versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.17, which was unchanged versus Q1 of last year. Our Q1 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude pretax charges of $66 million primarily related to costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and store closures. It also excludes a pretax charge of $32 million related to the pending sale of Staples Print Solutions. On a GAAP basis, we reported net earnings of $0.06 per share. 
Gross profit margin for the first quarter decreased 33 basis points to 25.3% versus Q1 of last year. This primarily reflects lower product margin rate in International Operations, and it was partially offset by improved product margins in North American stores. 
During the first quarter, total company SG&A decreased $59 million year-over-year after excluding a $24 million charge in Q1 of this year primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot, $11 million of acquisition-related costs and $4 million of accelerated depreciation during Q1 of last year. This reflects lower labor costs due to headcount reductions and store closures, lower marketing expense and the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. As a percentage of sales, SG&A, excluding charges, decreased 44 basis points to 21.5%. 
Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 3.4%. 
Turning to our Q1 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q1 of 2015. This modest year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
Q1 capital expenditures came in at $44 million, a decrease of $16 million versus the prior year. 
With operating cash flow of $276 million, we generated free cash flow of $232 million during the first quarter. During the first quarter, we did make cash payments of $69 million related to the Office Depot financing commitment fees earned by our lenders in 2015. If you exclude the negative impact of these payments, our first quarter free cash flow came in at $301 million. 
At the end of Q1, Staples had approximately $2 billion in liquidity including cash and cash equivalents of $946 million and available lines of credits of about $1.1 billion. 
As Ron mentioned at the beginning of the call, one of our top priorities is to continue returning excess cash to shareholders. We returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually through cash dividends, and we remain committed to our dividend program. We also plan to resume share repurchases during Q2. Our current forecast is for about $100 million of share repurchases in 2016. As a result, we plan to return approximately $400 million to shareholders this year through dividends and repurchases. 
Now turning to our outlook. We remain on track to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the second quarter, we expect total company sales to decrease versus Q2 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and our contract businesses in North America. This will be offset by the headwinds related to the sale of Staples Print Solutions as well as ongoing weaknesses in technology in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.13. Our earnings guidance excludes remaining costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and the impact of ongoing store closures as well as the negative impact of the Office Depot breakup fee. 
We expect to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the impact of cash payments related to acquisition financing as well as the impact of the breakup fee that we will pay Office Depot this week.  
In 2016, we plan to close at least 50 retail stores in North America. 
Over time, our strategic plan will drive improvement in both the top line and the bottom line. We will experience sales pressures as we explore strategic alternatives in Europe and as we continue to close retail stores in North America. These headwinds will be offset by mid-market growth, fueled by the categories beyond office supplies. We expect to get back to sustainable earnings growth as we reshape Staples and resume our repurchase program. We also expect Staples free cash flow and a significant improvement in return on net assets as we increase our focus on asset-light businesses and reduce our exposure for our weakest performing businesses. 
I'll now turn it back over to our conference call moderator for Q&A."

And whether that's kind of the opportunity of mid-market customers where we think there's a great opportunity to, one, get more of them as well as sell more to them; whether that's getting focused as more of a delivery asset-light company versus an asset-heavy company, and we've talked about what we're doing with retail stores and what we've done with retail stores; whether that talks about making really a tough decision about looking at opportunities and options relating to our European business and I think in our situation in a declining industry, cost out is something we have to continue and we've done a pretty good job with that as well. So I think those are the elements of the strategy.

If you look at some of the largest companies in America, I mean, they're already buying very, very well. When you look at our online business, our retail business, I think there are some items that are -- we are -- remain too high at. Online, a couple of weeks ago, we announced kind of very significant reductions in prices on ink and toner, which is the most price-sensitive item or one of the most price-sensitive items for our customers. So I think our goal is to get close to anybody out there in the price-sensitive items. Not saying you have to be the absolute lowest, but I think you've got to be within shouting distance. And particularly, when you think about some of the other things that retail offers, there are some advantages at retail that maybe customers don't quite expect you to be absolute lowest, but the other things that retail offers allows you to be a maybe slightly higher. So I think we look at pricing like everybody else does. We look at price-sensitive items, we look at the elasticity of those, we look at things that are kind of medium and then we look at things that are not elastic at all. But I think, in general, over the last 3 years, part of the investments that we've made as a result of the cost takeout has been to lower prices and I think we still have a ways to go. And then finally, once we get into the contract area, you're negotiating prices item by item in terms of off-contract or on contract and I'm not sure there's a lot more to be done there because we're pretty aggressively priced in the contract side of our business already."

Thanks for joining us today. This morning, we announced our first quarter results that were right in line with our expectations. Before I discuss Q1 in more detail, I'd like to start off by covering some recen",2980,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. This morning, we announced our first quarter results that were right in line with our expectations. 
Before I discuss Q1 in more detail, I'd like to start off by covering some recent headlines relating to 2 topics: one is our attempted acquisition of Office Depot; and two is our strategic plan going forward. I think everybody on the call knows that last week, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the FTC's request to block our acquisition of Office Depot. We were disappointed that the FTC's request was granted despite the fact that, in our view, it failed to define the relative -- the relevant market correctly and fell short of proving its case. The FTC excluded ink and toner from the market definition of consumable office supplies. They only focused on Fortune 100 customers and acknowledged that there were no concerns about any harm to consumers or small or medium businesses. The FTC ignored a competitive threat from Amazon business and a host of other competitors and also encouraged witnesses to say things that weren't true to bolster their case.  We're also disappointed that our proposed remedies to satisfy the FTC's concerns were unsuccessful, and that our commitment to invest a significant portion of the synergies and lower prices for all customers was not heard. 
We pursued the Office Depot acquisition to provide increased value to customers to compete more effectively against the large and diverse set of competitors and to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Over the past 20 months, we've committed a lot of time and resources to getting the deal done. Given the additional time and resources we'd have to commit to pursue an appeal, we have determined that it's in the best interest of our shareholders to forego appealing the court's ruling. Earlier this week, we terminated the merger agreement with Office Depot and we will pay the $250 million breakout fee tomorrow. Our divestiture agreement with Essendant also terminated in connection with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. And finally, I'd just like to thank both Office Depot and Essendant for their hard work and for their collaboration as we pursued this transaction. 
We're now focused on moving forward and we're focused on executing our strategic plan to drive shareholder value or what we're referring to internally as Staples 2020. This plan builds on our reinvention successes over the past few years and it is supported by our strongest competitive advantages. We've had good success driving growth in categories beyond office supplies and in growing our mid-market contract business. We've also been challenged by weak results in Europe and in North American stores. We're confident that by narrowing our focus, more aggressively pursuing our best opportunities, accelerating growth in our asset-light businesses and pulling back in areas with less potential, we can get back to sustainable long-term sales and earnings growth and significantly improve return on net assets. 
Our strategic plan includes 4 key priorities. First, we're focusing on winning with mid-market customers in North America by accelerating growth in services and products beyond office supplies. Second, we're reshaping Staples by narrowing our focus in North America, rightsizing our retail network and exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. Third, we're taking aggressive action to reduce cost and drive efficiency further across the organization. And fourth, we're continuing to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Two months ago, we streamlined our organization to build a simplified structure, speed up decision-making and provide flexibility to invest in our critical strategic objectives. The changes we've made have set us up for success. With Shira Goodman leading our North American operations and John Wilson overseeing our International Operations and our strategic planning and transformation efforts, I'm confident that we have the right team in place to win with customers.  Over the next 3 years, we'll dramatically change the profile of Staples as we position our company for the future. More than 95% of our sales will come from North America versus about 85% today. About 80% of our sales will be Delivery versus 60% today. And sales beyond office supplies will account for more than 60% of our revenue versus less than 50% today. 
Let me take a few minutes to give you a little more color on each of our 4 priorities. First, winning with mid-market customers in North America. We define the mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees. This is a highly profitable and highly fragmented customer segment, and today, we have very low share with mid-market customers in categories beyond office supplies. The needs of those mid-market customers align closely with our strengths. These customers need a wide assortment of products and services, the support of category specialists who have expertise and easy online shopping experience as well as quick and reliable delivery. 
We have expertise in a wide range of product and services. We have a world-class supply chain and next-day delivery capability. Our digital expertise provides a differentiated customer experience. We have a new mid-market loyalty program that is driving increased spend, high retention rates and increased customer engagement. And we recently rebranded our B2B division, Staples Business Advantage, to emphasize the many advantages that we can provide to those business customers. 
To accelerate growth in the mid-market, we developed a strong customer-focused plan that builds on these strengths. Our plan focuses on increasing our share of wallet with the hundreds of thousands of mid-market customers we serve today and on acquiring many of the mid-market customers that we don't currently serve. We're increasing our offering of products and services beyond office supplies and pursuing market share gains in core categories like office supplies, ink, toner and paper. We're investing in sharper pricing and enhanced supply chain capabilities. We're dramatically expanding the size of our mid-market sales force with the addition of more than 1,000 new sales reps. And we're also pursuing acquisitions of B2B service providers and companies specializing in categories beyond office supplies. In summary, we're helping small or mid-mark customers compete like a Fortune 500 company. 
Second, we're reshaping Staples to reduce risk and preserve profitability. John Wilson and the leadership team in Europe have worked tirelessly to streamline and stabilized Europe over the past few years. While we believe there's a significant opportunity to generate value in the highly fragmented European market, we also recognize that our best growth opportunities are in North America and that these are our primary focus. As a result, we've decided to explore strategic alternatives for our European operations. Over the coming weeks, we plan to meet with potential buyers of our European operations and we will provide more details on timing and valuation as we work through this process. 
We also remain committed to increasing productivity and preserving profitability in our North American retail stores. We have closed more than 300 stores and reduced our lease obligations by more than $1 billion in North America since 2011. We've also aggressively managed our lease renewal process. Today, our average remaining lease life in North America is about 3.5 years per store. That's a reduction of more than 40% since 2011. We've challenged the retail stores team to do more with less, and they have delivered. Customer service scores remain strong and customer conversion is at an all-time high. We will remain laser-focused on these metrics going forward. We'll also continue to rightsize our retail store portfolio in North America by closing at least 50 stores this year. In addition to closing unproductive stores, we'll continue to build on the strength of our omnichannel capabilities and services like copy and print. We believe our stores provide convenience and immediacy that is valued by customers of all sizes including mid-market customers. 
Our third priority is to aggressively reduce cost across the company to drive efficiency and fund our growth investments. Over the past 3 years, we've generated approximately $750 million of annualized pretax cost savings by evolving the business processes, increasing productivity and developing more efficient ways to serve customers. Last week, we announced a new multi-year cost-savings plan, which is expected to generate an additional $300 million of annualized pretax cost savings by the end of 2018. We're focused on reducing product costs, optimizing promotions, increasing the mix of Staples brand products and reducing operating expenses. We'll also continue to reduce costs in retail stores as we rightsize our store network. 
Our fourth priority is to continue returning cash to shareholders. We remain committed to our ongoing cash dividend program. We plan to resume repurchasing our common stock through open market purchases during the second quarter of 2016. We're currently planning for share repurchases of approximately $100 million in 2016. As the industry leader, we pursue the acquisition of Office Depot from a position of strength. We're now pursuing our strategic plan from a similar position. We are dramatically reshaping our business while increasing our focus on categories beyond office supplies and evolving to meet the changing needs of mid-market customers. We are reducing our exposure to underperforming businesses, and we are reiterating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Total company sales for Q1 were down about 1% year-over-year excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP operating income rate in dollars improved versus Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.17 was flat versus Q1 of last year.  On our Q4 earnings call, we talked about our key priorities for '16, which are now a critical part of our strategic plan. Let me take a few minutes to give you some color on our progress during the first quarter. 
One of our top priorities is to accelerate growth in categories beyond office supplies. Today, nearly half of our sales are generated beyond office supplies, and business customers are increasingly relying on Staples to provide them with wider assortment of products and services. The market for these categories is highly fragmented and we're winning with business customers of all sizes by providing a differentiated level of service and expertise. During Q1, North American contract continued to lead the way here with growth in promotional products, facility supplies, break room supplies, technology and furniture. We also grew key categories beyond office supplies in North American Stores and Online during Q1 with comparable sales growth in furniture, facility supplies, copy and print, mail and ship and break room supplies. 
Another priority is to grow our mid-market penetration in contract. During Q1, we grew North American contract sales by 2% in local currency. Our strongest momentum was in the mid-market where sales were up in the mid-single digits driven by sales beyond office supplies, which is up about 10% year-over-year. Improved customer acquisition and retention offset modestly lower sales to existing customers and this was supported by additional mid-market sales reps that we hired during Q1 as well as continued strong performance in our mid-market membership program. 
We also narrowed our focus on our best growth opportunities in contract during the first quarter with the announcement of our intention to sell our contract print manufacturing and operations business to Taylor Corporation. We acquired the contract print business when we bought Corporate Express in 2008. As we increase our focus on growing our asset-light businesses and improving return on net assets, it made sense for us to part ways with contract print. At Staples, we lack the scale and manufacturing expertise that this business requires. The business is also very capital-intensive, generates an operating margin below the house and generates return on net assets below our cost of capital. While this business isn't a great fit in the Staples portfolio, it's a perfect fit for Taylor. We expect the deal to close during the second quarter. We look forward to continuing to offer a wide assortment of print solutions to our contract customers through vendor partnerships and our own in-store printing capability. 
We're also focused on improving traffic, both in-store and online. Results here have been mixed during the first quarter. In Canada, traffic in stores and online increased year-over-year and we improved customer conversion. In the United States, we also improved customer conversion in stores and online, but this was not enough to offset lower customer traffic across both channels. We remain committed to improving customer traffic online and conversion in stores. A few weeks ago, we launched the new unbeatable prices for ink and toner, and while it's still early, I'm pleased to report that customer feedback has been very positive and we've seen a nice improvement in online traffic in the U.S. during the first few weeks of Q2. We know this is the right decision to improve price perception while driving business customer acquisition and retention over the long term. 
Over the past few years, we've had success driving growth in categories beyond office supplies, growing our mid-market contract business and providing better value for our customers by investing lower prices. Our momentum continued during the first quarter. Our strategic plan is supported by our strongest competitive advantages and builds on these successes. We're confident that by narrowing our focus and more aggressively pursuing our best opportunities will speed up our transformation while positioning Staples for sustainable long-term sales and earnings growth. 
Let's take a quick look at first quarter results from each of our business units. I'm going to start with North American Commercial. Here, sales were up 1% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollar were flat versus Q1 of last year at $2.1 billion, and contract sales grew 2% local currency during the quarter. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we continued to drive strong growth in categories beyond office supplies and contract during the first quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in promotional products and break room supplies and sales were up in the high single digits in facility supplies. Contract sales in core categories like ink and toner and paper were down in the low to mid-single digits and sales of office supplies were flat versus Q1 of 2015. 
During the first quarter, North American Commercial operating margin increased 63 basis points to 7% and operating income grew by approximately $14 million or about 10% year-over-year. This improvement primarily reflects lower labor cost and reduced marketing expense. We expect the divestiture of Staples Print Solutions to close over the coming weeks, and as a result of the sale, we're planning for about a 4% headwind to our reported North American Commercial sales and about a 2% headwind to our reported total company sales over the next year. 
Turning to North American Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 2% excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales were down 5% to $2.2 billion versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 3%. This reflects a 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 4% decline in same-store sales. Results in Canada were stronger than the U.S. in both stores and online during the first quarter. 
From a category perspective, the 3% decline in comparable sales during Q1 was entirely driven by ongoing weakness in technology as well as weakness in ink and toner. In technology, tablets and technology accessories were our weakest categories with double-digit declines year-over-year. Ink and toner was down in the low single digits. Outside of technology and ink and toner, comparable sales in Stores and Online grew during the first quarter. This growth was driven by furniture, office supplies, facility supplies and copy and print.  
North American Stores and Online operating margin decreased 40 basis points year-over-year to 2.8%. This primarily reflects the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses as well as lower product margins at Staples.com versus Q1 of last year. This was partially offset by reduced marketing expense, improved retail product margin rate and savings related to reduction in headcount. We continue to rightsize our retail store network in North America. During the quarter, we closed 14 stores in the United States, ending Q1 with 1,288 stores in the United States and 305 stores in Canada. We've now closed 256 stores or about 14% of the North American chain since 2014. 
Finally, turning to International Operations. Sales here decreased 3%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 6% year-over-year to $738 million versus Q1 of last year. In Europe retail, same-store sales declined 9% during the first quarter driven primarily by decrease in customer traffic versus Q1. In our contract business in Europe, local currency sales were down in the high single digits during the first quarter. In our European online business, local currency sales were down in the low single digits. Despite the weak sales trends in Europe during the first quarter, John Wilson and his team in Europe did a great job aggressively managing expenses, and in fact, drove improved profitability year-over-year. 
Outside of Europe, we continued to drive solid growth in China during Q1 with sales up in the strong double-digit range in local currency versus Q1 of last year. We also continued to make progress improving the bottom line in Australia, New Zealand as well as China. On the bottom line, International operating rate -- margin rate improved 13 basis points versus Q1 of last year to an operating loss of 2.4%, and this was driven by year-over-year improvement in Australia, China and in Europe. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Christine to review our financial results. Christine?"

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined 1% versus Q1 of last year. This excludes a 1% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from stores we closed in North America during the past year. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 3% versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.17, which was unchanged versus Q1 of last year. Our Q1 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $66 million primarily related to costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and store closures. It also excludes a pretax charge of $32 million related to the pending sale of Staples Print Solutions. On a GAAP basis, we reported net earnings of $0.06 per share. 
Gross profit margin for the first quarter decreased 33 basis points to 25.3% versus Q1 of last year. This primarily reflects lower product margin rate in International Operations, and it was partially offset by improved product margins in North American stores. During the first quarter, total company SG&A decreased $59 million year-over-year after excluding a $24 million charge in Q1 of this year primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot, $11 million of acquisition-related costs and $4 million of accelerated depreciation during Q1 of last year. This reflects lower labor costs due to headcount reductions and store closures, lower marketing expense and the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. As a percentage of sales, SG&A, excluding charges, decreased 44 basis points to 21.5%. Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 3.4%. 
Turning to our Q1 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q1 of 2015. This modest year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. Q1 capital expenditures came in at $44 million, a decrease of $16 million versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $276 million, we generated free cash flow of $232 million during the first quarter. During the first quarter, we did make cash payments of $69 million related to the Office Depot financing commitment fees earned by our lenders in 2015. If you exclude the negative impact of these payments, our first quarter free cash flow came in at $301 million. 
At the end of Q1, Staples had approximately $2 billion in liquidity including cash and cash equivalents of $946 million and available lines of credits of about $1.1 billion. As Ron mentioned at the beginning of the call, one of our top priorities is to continue returning excess cash to shareholders. We returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually through cash dividends, and we remain committed to our dividend program. We also plan to resume share repurchases during Q2. Our current forecast is for about $100 million of share repurchases in 2016. As a result, we plan to return approximately $400 million to shareholders this year through dividends and repurchases. 
Now turning to our outlook. We remain on track to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the second quarter, we expect total company sales to decrease versus Q2 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and our contract businesses in North America. This will be offset by the headwinds related to the sale of Staples Print Solutions as well as ongoing weaknesses in technology in our retail stores and store closures. On the bottom line, we expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.13. Our earnings guidance excludes remaining costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and the impact of ongoing store closures as well as the negative impact of the Office Depot breakup fee. We expect to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the impact of cash payments related to acquisition financing as well as the impact of the breakup fee that we will pay Office Depot this week.  In 2016, we plan to close at least 50 retail stores in North America. 
Over time, our strategic plan will drive improvement in both the top line and the bottom line. We will experience sales pressures as we explore strategic alternatives in Europe and as we continue to close retail stores in North America. These headwinds will be offset by mid-market growth, fueled by the categories beyond office supplies. We expect to get back to sustainable earnings growth as we reshape Staples and resume our repurchase program. We also expect stable free cash flow and a significant improvement in return on net assets as we increase our focus on asset-light businesses and reduce our exposure for our weakest performing businesses. 
I'll now turn it back over to our conference call moderator for Q&A."

And whether that's kind of the opportunity of mid-market customers where we think there's a great opportunity to, one, get more of them as well as sell more to them; whether that's getting focused as more of a delivery asset-light company versus an asset-heavy company, and we've talked about what we're doing with retail stores and what we've done with retail stores; whether that talks about making really a tough decision about looking at opportunities and options relating to our European business and I think in our situation in a declining industry, cost out is something we have to continue and we've done a pretty good job with that as well. So I think those are the elements of the strategy.

And particularly, when you think about some of the other things that retail offers, there are some advantages at retail that maybe customers don't quite expect you to be absolute lowest, but the other things that retail offers allows you to be maybe slightly higher. So I think we look at pricing like everybody else does. We look at price-sensitive items, we look at the elasticity of those, we look at things that are kind of medium and then we look at things that are not elastic at all. But I think, in general, over the last 3 years, part of the investments that we've made as a result of the cost takeout has been to lower prices and I think we still have a ways to go. And then finally, once we get into the contract area, you're negotiating prices item by item in terms of off-contract or on contract and I'm not sure there's a lot more to be done there because we're pretty aggressively priced in the contract side of our business already."

Thanks for joining us today. This morning, we announced our first quarter results that were right in line with our expectations.

This morning, we announced our first quarter results that were right in line with our expectations. 
Before I discuss Q1 in more detail, I'd like to start off by covering some recent headlines relating to 2 topics: one is our attempted acquisition of Office Depot; and two is our strategic plan going forward. I think everybody on the call knows that last week, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the FTC's request to block our acquisition of Office Depot. We were disappointed that the FTC's request was granted despite the fact that, in our view, it failed to define the relative -- the relevant market correctly and fell short of proving its case. The FTC excluded ink and toner from the market definition of consumable office supplies. They only focused on Fortune 100 customers and acknowledged that there were no concerns about any harm to consumers or small or medium businesses. The FTC ignored a competitive threat from Amazon business and a host of other competitors and also encouraged witnesses to say things that weren't true to bolster their case.  We're also disappointed that our proposed remedies to satisfy the FTC's concerns were unsuccessful, and that our commitment to invest a significant portion of the synergies and lower prices for all customers was not heard. 
We pursued the Office Depot acquisition to provide increased value to customers to compete more effectively against the large and diverse set of competitors and to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Over the past 20 months, we've committed a lot of time and resources to getting the deal done. Given the additional time and resources we'd have to commit to pursue an appeal, we have determined that it's in the best interest of our shareholders to forego appealing the court's ruling. Earlier this week, we terminated the merger agreement with Office Depot and we will pay the $250 million breakout fee tomorrow. Our divestiture agreement with Essendant also terminated in connection with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. And finally, I'd just like to thank both Office Depot and Essendant for their hard work and for their collaboration as we pursued this transaction. 
We're now focused on moving forward and we're focused on executing our strategic plan to drive shareholder value or what we're referring to internally as Staples 2020. This plan builds on our reinvention successes over the past few years and it is supported by our strongest competitive advantages. We've had good success driving growth in categories beyond office supplies and in growing our mid-market contract business. We've also been challenged by weak results in Europe and in North American stores. We're confident that by narrowing our focus, more aggressively pursuing our best opportunities, accelerating growth in our asset-light businesses and pulling back in areas with less potential, we can get back to sustainable long-term sales and earnings growth and significantly improve return on net assets. 
Our strategic plan includes 4 key priorities. First, we're focusing on winning with mid-market customers in North America by accelerating growth in services and products beyond office supplies. Second, we're reshaping Staples by narrowing our focus in North America, rightsizing our retail network and exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. Third, we're taking aggressive action to reduce cost and drive efficiency further across the organization. And fourth, we're continuing to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Two months ago, we streamlined our organization to build a simplified structure, speed up decision-making and provide flexibility to invest in our critical strategic objectives. The changes we've made have set us up for success. With Shira Goodman leading our North American operations and John Wilson overseeing our International Operations and our strategic planning and transformation efforts, I'm confident that we have the right team in place to win with customers.  Over the next 3 years, we'll dramatically change the profile of Staples as we position our company for the future. More than 95% of our sales will come from North America versus about 85% today. About 80% of our sales will be Delivery versus 60% today. And sales beyond office supplies will account for more than 60% of our revenue versus less than 50% today. 
Let me take a few minutes to give you a little more color on each of our 4 priorities. First, winning with mid-market customers in North America. We define the mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees. This is a highly profitable and highly fragmented customer segment, and today, we have very low share with mid-market customers in categories beyond office supplies. The needs of those mid-market customers align closely with our strengths. These customers need a wide assortment of products and services, the support of category specialists who have expertise and easy online shopping experience as well as quick and reliable delivery. 
We have expertise in a wide range of product and services. We have a world-class supply chain and next-day delivery capability. Our digital expertise provides a differentiated customer experience. We have a new mid-market loyalty program that is driving increased spend, high retention rates and increased customer engagement. And we recently rebranded our B2B division, Staples Business Advantage, to emphasize the many advantages that we can provide to those business customers. 
To accelerate growth in the mid-market, we developed a strong customer-focused plan that builds on these strengths. Our plan focuses on increasing our share of wallet with the hundreds of thousands of mid-market customers we serve today and on acquiring many of the mid-market customers that we don't currently serve. We're increasing our offering of products and services beyond office supplies and pursuing market share gains in core categories like office supplies, ink, toner and paper. We're investing in sharper pricing and enhanced supply chain capabilities. We're dramatically expanding the size of our mid-market sales force with the addition of more than 1,000 new sales reps. And we're also pursuing acquisitions of B2B service providers and companies specializing in categories beyond office supplies. In summary, we're helping small or mid-market customers compete like a Fortune 500 company. 
Second, we're reshaping Staples to reduce risk and preserve profitability. John Wilson and the leadership team in Europe have worked tirelessly to streamline and stabilized Europe over the past few years. While we believe there's a significant opportunity to generate value in the highly fragmented European market, we also recognize that our best growth opportunities are in North America and that these are our primary focus. As a result, we've decided to explore strategic alternatives for our European operations. Over the coming weeks, we plan to meet with potential buyers of our European operations and we will provide more details on timing and valuation as we work through this process. 
We also remain committed to increasing productivity and preserving profitability in our North American retail stores. We have closed more than 300 stores and reduced our lease obligations by more than $1 billion in North America since 2011. We've also aggressively managed our lease renewal process. Today, our average remaining lease life in North America is about 3.5 years per store. That's a reduction of more than 40% since 2011. We've challenged the retail stores team to do more with less, and they have delivered. Customer service scores remain strong and customer conversion is at an all-time high. We will remain laser-focused on these metrics going forward. We'll also continue to rightsize our retail store portfolio in North America by closing at least 50 stores this year. In addition to closing unproductive stores, we'll continue to build on the strength of our omnichannel capabilities and services like copy and print. We believe our stores provide convenience and immediacy that is valued by customers of all sizes including mid-market customers. 
Our third priority is to aggressively reduce cost across the company to drive efficiency and fund our growth investments. Over the past 3 years, we've generated approximately $750 million of annualized pretax cost savings by evolving the business processes, increasing productivity and developing more efficient ways to serve customers. Last week, we announced a new multi-year cost-savings plan, which is expected to generate an additional $300 million of annualized pretax cost savings by the end of 2018. We're focused on reducing product costs, optimizing promotions, increasing the mix of Staples brand products and reducing operating expenses. We'll also continue to reduce costs in retail stores as we rightsize our store network. 
Our fourth priority is to continue returning cash to shareholders. We remain committed to our ongoing cash dividend program. We plan to resume repurchasing our common stock through open market purchases during the second quarter of 2016. We're currently planning for share repurchases of approximately $100 million in 2016. As the industry leader, we pursue the acquisition of Office Depot from a position of strength. We're now pursuing our strategic plan from a similar position. We are dramatically reshaping our business while increasing our focus on categories beyond office supplies and evolving to meet the changing needs of mid-market customers. We are reducing our exposure to underperforming businesses, and we are reiterating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Total company sales for Q1 were down about 1% year-over-year excluding the impact of store closures and changes in foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP operating income rate in dollars improved versus Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.17 was flat versus Q1 of last year.  On our Q4 earnings call, we talked about our key priorities for '16, which are now a critical part of our strategic plan. Let me take a few minutes to give you some color on our progress during the first quarter. 
One of our top priorities is to accelerate growth in categories beyond office supplies. Today, nearly half of our sales are generated beyond office supplies, and business customers are increasingly relying on Staples to provide them with wider assortment of products and services. The market for these categories is highly fragmented and we're winning with business customers of all sizes by providing a differentiated level of service and expertise. During Q1, North American contract continued to lead the way here with growth in promotional products, facility supplies, break room supplies, technology and furniture. We also grew key categories beyond office supplies in North American Stores and Online during Q1 with comparable sales growth in furniture, facility supplies, copy and print, mail and ship and break room supplies. 
Another priority is to grow our mid-market penetration in contract. During Q1, we grew North American contract sales by 2% in local currency. Our strongest momentum was in the mid-market where sales were up in the mid-single digits driven by sales beyond office supplies, which is up about 10% year-over-year. Improved customer acquisition and retention offset modestly lower sales to existing customers and this was supported by additional mid-market sales reps that we hired during Q1 as well as continued strong performance in our mid-market membership program. 
We also narrowed our focus on our best growth opportunities in contract during the first quarter with the announcement of our intention to sell our contract print manufacturing and operations business to Taylor Corporation. We acquired the contract print business when we bought Corporate Express in 2008. As we increase our focus on growing our asset-light businesses and improving return on net assets, it made sense for us to part ways with contract print. At Staples, we lack the scale and manufacturing expertise that this business requires. The business is also very capital-intensive, generates an operating margin below the house and generates return on net assets below our cost of capital. While this business isn't a great fit in the Staples portfolio, it's a perfect fit for Taylor. We expect the deal to close during the second quarter. We look forward to continuing to offer a wide assortment of print solutions to our contract customers through vendor partnerships and our own in-store printing capability. 
We're also focused on improving traffic, both in-store and online. Results here have been mixed during the first quarter. In Canada, traffic in stores and online increased year-over-year and we improved customer conversion. In the United States, we also improved customer conversion in stores and online, but this was not enough to offset lower customer traffic across both channels. We remain committed to improving customer traffic online and conversion in stores. A few weeks ago, we launched the new unbeatable prices for ink and toner, and while it's still early, I'm pleased to report that customer feedback has been very positive and we've seen a nice improvement in online traffic in the U.S. during the first few weeks of Q2. We know this is the right decision to improve price perception while driving business customer acquisition and retention over the long term. 
Over the past few years, we've had success driving growth in categories beyond office supplies, growing our mid-market contract business and providing better value for our customers by investing lower prices. Our momentum continued during the first quarter. Our strategic plan is supported by our strongest competitive advantages and builds on these successes. We're confident that by narrowing our focus and more aggressively pursuing our best opportunities will speed up our transformation while positioning Staples for sustainable long-term sales and earnings growth. 
Let's take a quick look at first quarter results from each of our business units. I'm going to start with North American Commercial. Here, sales were up 1% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollar were flat versus Q1 of last year at $2.1 billion, and contract sales grew 2% local currency during the quarter. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we continued to drive strong growth in categories beyond office supplies and contract during the first quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in promotional products and break room supplies and sales were up in the high single digits in facility supplies. Contract sales in core categories like ink and toner and paper were down in the low to mid-single digits and sales of office supplies were flat versus Q1 of 2015. 
During the first quarter, North American Commercial operating margin increased 63 basis points to 7% and operating income grew by approximately $14 million or about 10% year-over-year. This improvement primarily reflects lower labor cost and reduced marketing expense. We expect the divestiture of Staples Print Solutions to close over the coming weeks, and as a result of the sale, we're planning for about a 4% headwind to our reported North American Commercial sales and about a 2% headwind to our reported total company sales over the next year. 
Turning to North American Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 2% excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales were down 5% to $2.2 billion versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 3%. This reflects a 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 4% decline in same-store sales. Results in Canada were stronger than the U.S. in both stores and online during the first quarter. 
From a category perspective, the 3% decline in comparable sales during Q1 was entirely driven by ongoing weakness in technology as well as weakness in ink and toner. In technology, tablets and technology accessories were our weakest categories with double-digit declines year-over-year. Ink and toner was down in the low single digits. Outside of technology and ink and toner, comparable sales in Stores and Online grew during the first quarter. This growth was driven by furniture, office supplies, facility supplies and copy and print.  
North American Stores and Online operating margin decreased 40 basis points year-over-year to 2.8%. This primarily reflects the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses as well as lower product margins at Staples.com versus Q1 of last year. This was partially offset by reduced marketing expense, improved retail product margin rate and savings related to reduction in headcount. We continue to rightsize our retail store network in North America. During the quarter, we closed 14 stores in the United States, ending Q1 with 1,288 stores in the United States and 305 stores in Canada. We've now closed 256 stores or about 14% of the North American chain since 2014. 
Finally, turning to International Operations. Sales here decreased 3%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 6% year-over-year to $738 million versus Q1 of last year. In Europe retail, same-store sales declined 9% during the first quarter driven primarily by decrease in customer traffic versus Q1. In our contract business in Europe, local currency sales were down in the high single digits during the first quarter. In our European online business, local currency sales were down in the low single digits. Despite the weak sales trends in Europe during the first quarter, John Wilson and his team in Europe did a great job aggressively managing expenses, and in fact, drove improved profitability year-over-year. 
Outside of Europe, we continued to drive solid growth in China during Q1 with sales up in the strong double-digit range in local currency versus Q1 of last year. We also continued to make progress improving the bottom line in Australia, New Zealand as well as China. On the bottom line, International operating rate -- margin rate improved 13 basis points versus Q1 of last year to an operating loss of 2.4%, and this was driven by year-over-year improvement in Australia, China and in Europe. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Christine to review our financial results. Christine?"

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined 1% versus Q1 of last year. This excludes a 1% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from stores we closed in North America during the past year. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 3% versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.17, which was unchanged versus Q1 of last year. Our Q1 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $66 million primarily related to costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and store closures. It also excludes a pretax charge of $32 million related to the pending sale of Staples Print Solutions. On a GAAP basis, we reported net earnings of $0.06 per share. 
Gross profit margin for the first quarter decreased 33 basis points to 25.3% versus Q1 of last year. This primarily reflects lower product margin rate in International Operations, and it was partially offset by improved product margins in North American stores. During the first quarter, total company SG&A decreased $59 million year-over-year after excluding a $24 million charge in Q1 of this year primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot, $11 million of acquisition-related costs and $4 million of accelerated depreciation during Q1 of last year. This reflects lower labor costs due to headcount reductions and store closures, lower marketing expense and the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. As a percentage of sales, SG&A, excluding charges, decreased 44 basis points to 21.5%. Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 3.4%. 
Turning to our Q1 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q1 of 2015. This modest year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. Q1 capital expenditures came in at $44 million, a decrease of $16 million versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $276 million, we generated free cash flow of $232 million during the first quarter. During the first quarter, we did make cash payments of $69 million related to the Office Depot financing commitment fees earned by our lenders in 2015. If you exclude the negative impact of these payments, our first quarter free cash flow came in at $301 million. 
At the end of Q1, Staples had approximately $2 billion in liquidity including cash and cash equivalents of $946 million and available lines of credits of about $1.1 billion. As Ron mentioned at the beginning of the call, one of our top priorities is to continue returning excess cash to shareholders. We returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually through cash dividends, and we remain committed to our dividend program. We also plan to resume share repurchases during Q2. Our current forecast is for about $100 million of share repurchases in 2016. As a result, we plan to return approximately $400 million to shareholders this year through dividends and repurchases. 
Now turning to our outlook. We remain on track to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the second quarter, we expect total company sales to decrease versus Q2 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and our contract businesses in North America. This will be offset by the headwinds related to the sale of Staples Print Solutions as well as ongoing weaknesses in technology in our retail stores and store closures. On the bottom line, we expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.11 to $0.13. Our earnings guidance excludes remaining costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and the impact of ongoing store closures as well as the negative impact of the Office Depot breakup fee. We expect to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the impact of cash payments related to acquisition financing as well as the impact of the breakup fee that we will pay Office Depot this week.  In 2016, we plan to close at least 50 retail stores in North America. 
Over time, our strategic plan will drive improvement in both the top line and the bottom line. We will experience sales pressures as we explore strategic alternatives in Europe and as we continue to close retail stores in North America. These headwinds will be offset by mid-market growth, fueled by the categories beyond office supplies. We expect to get back to sustainable earnings growth as we reshape Staples and resume our repurchase program. We also expect stable free cash flow and a significant improvement in return on net assets as we increase our focus on asset-light businesses and reduce our exposure for our weakest performing businesses. 
I'll now turn it back over to our conference call moderator for Q&A."

And whether that's kind of the opportunity of mid-market customers where we think there's a great opportunity to, one, get more of them as well as sell more to them; whether that's getting focused as more of a delivery asset-light company versus an asset-heavy company, and we've talked about what we're doing with retail stores and what we've done with retail stores; whether that talks about making really a tough decision about looking at opportunities and options relating to our European business and I think in our situation in a declining industry, cost out is something we have to continue and we've done a pretty good job with that as well. So I think those are the elements of the strategy.

And actually, that's a lot of the opportunity, which is how do we bring the different channels together and really have a convergence of force to go much more after. So from a North America perspective, it is closer to 10% or 15% of the total North American business. And we're already, today, growing and gaining share in this market. And the key on it is that these companies are large enough that they have more sophisticated needs in marketing, facilities, et cetera, but they're small enough that they don't actually have the sophistication or the scale to have those in-house. So we are seeing that the value proposition of broad assortment, competitive pricing, very reliable delivery plus the expertise that we bring is really enabling us to gain share both in the core, but especially in the beyond office supply category."

If you look at some of the largest companies in America, I mean, they're already buying very, very well.

Online, couple weeks ago, we announced kind of very significant reductions in prices on ink and toner, which is the most price-sensitive item or one of the most price-sensitive items for our customers. So I think our goal is to get close to anybody out there in the price-sensitive items. Not saying you have to be the absolute lowest, but I think you've got to be within shouting distance. And particularly, when you think about some of the other things that retail offers, there are some advantages at retail that maybe customers don't quite expect you to be absolute lowest, but the other things that retail offers allows you to be maybe slightly higher. So I think we look at pricing like everybody else does. We look at price-sensitive items, we look at the elasticity of those, we look at things that are kind of medium and then we look at things that are not elastic at all. But I think, in general, over the last 3 years, part of the investments that we've made as a result of the cost takeout has been to lower prices and I think we still have a ways to go.

We are trying to make sure that our lease obligation is getting as low as possible, so we do have flexibility going forward. But in terms of our number of stores, we're not getting there."

This morning, we announced Q2 results that were right in line with our expectation. I'd like to start by thanking the entire Staples team for remaining focused and delivering solid results during quite an eventful quarter that included the termination of our proposed acquisition of Office Depot, the immediate launch of a new strategic plan and a change in leadership. 
Total company sales were down less than 2%, excluding the impact of store closures, changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of our contract print business. Non-GAAP operating income grew 2% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.12 was flat versus Q2 of last year despite a slightly higher effective tax rate and share count. 
But before I discuss Q2 results in more detail, I'd like to just take a few minutes to provide some color on my first 2 months in the new role. 
I take on this role with a great sense of urgency. When I joined Staples in 1992, we were in the process of creating our catalog business. And over the years, I've seen it grow organically and through acquisitions. At that time, we had only 174 stores, and we were still 6 years away from launching staples.com. 
So it goes without saying that a lot has changed over the past 24 years as Staples has evolved from a retail company with a fledgling delivery business to a delivery company with a retail business. And yet, for all the change that I've been part of, the most important thing about our company has remained constant--our commitment to our business customers and to transforming to meet their changing needs. 
So June 15 was my first day on the job, and I dove right in. My top priority is to position our company for sustainable, long-term sales and earnings growth. And we're doing that via our Staples 2020 strategy.  This strategy includes a dramatic change in our mindset and our operating model. We're doubling down on Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, where we have solid momentum on both the top and bottom line as well as a best-in-class offering to build on. At the same time, we're focusing on maximizing profitability and reducing risk in our underperforming retail and European businesses. 
I'm confident that our future is bright, and the reason I'm so confident is because our strengths so far outnumber our challenges. We have what we need to win. 
Nearly 2 million customers visit our websites and our stores everyday. We have a world-class distribution network that provides next-day delivery to business customers of all sizes. Half of our sales now come from categories beyond office supplies, [ph] and we have expertise in these adjacent categories that allows us to expand our share of wallet with customers. 
Well over half of our sales are generated online through our private and public websites. We have leading e-commerce and digital capabilities. Our brand is widely known and well-respected. Our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity to support our long-term growth priorities. And most importantly, we have an incredible team of engaged and committed associates. 
On May 11, we announced our Staples 2020 strategy, which builds on all the strengths which I just listed but also address our biggest challenges. We have 4 critical strategic priorities: First, we're focused on winning in the mid-market in North America. I've spent a lot of time on this business over the years, and I couldn't be more optimistic about this opportunity. Second, preserving profitability in our North American stores. Third, taking aggressive action to further reduce costs and drive efficiency across the organization. And fourth, narrowing our geographic focus to North America by exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. 
Now since launching Staples 2020, I've made some changes to our leadership team and our organizational structure to get the right talent in the right seats on the box. Joe Doody, our Vice Chairman, has assumed leadership for North American operations. You all know Joe. He's an 18-year Staples veteran, and he has been the key architect for building and leading high-performing teams across our North American delivery businesses for the majority of his time with the company. In his new role, Joe will focus on executing our Staples 2020 strategy, delivering on our 2016 financial goals and driving synergies and teamwork across our North American operations leadership team. 
During Q2, we also took an important step forward by more closely aligning staples.com and Staples Business Advantage under Neil Ringel, our Executive Vice President of Staples Business Advantage. Neil has been with Staples for 21 years, and for the last 5 years, has been leading our $7 billion North American contract organization and driving consistent growth. He is one of our most dynamic and capable leaders, and I'm excited about his expanded role. Also this improved alignment between SBA and dot-com [ph] will allow us to better serve our mid-market customers regardless of their ordering platform. 
As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we're focused on preserving profitability in our North American retail stores. Steve Matyas has been appointed President of North American Retail. Steve has over 25 years of experience at Staples, primarily leading our Canadian retail and online businesses. In his new role, Steve will also lead our U.S. retail business. His track record of delivering strong returns is well known across Staples. 
Finally, as we shared during Q1, John Wilson has taken on the additional responsibilities of driving our transformation for all of Staples, and he has been a real partner to me in doing so. 
And as our strategy evolves, I will continue making the changes necessary to put us in the best possible position to win. To that end, during Q2, we also held a company-wide leadership meeting to align the organization and make sure that each and every one of our leaders understood our new strategy and what was their role in making it happen. We've been adopting a transformation mindset, and I've been challenging the management team to lead with focus and accountability, speed and teamwork, what I call FAST, [ph] and have been delighted by the response and already visible changes in behavior. 
Now let me give you more color around the progress we've made on each of our Staples 2020 strategic priorities during Q2. Let's start with our top growth priority, winning in the mid-market in North America. 
We have a differentiated approach to serving mid-market customers where technology and innovation are at the core of our offering. This approach combines the personal touch of our sales force with digital selling tools and robust data on customer behavior and preferences.  Just to be clear, we define the mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees, and they are a sweet spot for us. These customers are often large enough that they have sophisticated needs, but too small to have the expertise or resources for all of their needs in-house. Historically, our key differentiators in the mid-market have been deep assortment, very competitive pricing and fast delivery. Today, these differentiators have become table stakes. [ph] To win, we need to do more.  So we are accelerating our mid-market growth by leveraging our expertise and evolving our approach to customer acquisition, and we made some nice progress here during Q2. Mid-market sales grew in the mid-single digits versus last year, and this was fueled by double-digit growth in categories beyond office supplies [ph] as well as strong customer acquisition. We've enhanced our digital marketing and sales support capabilities, and by doing so, we are shortening the customer acquisition process and can significantly reduce the cost of acquisition. We also plan to double our mid-market sales force over the next few years and year-to-date, have already added over 100 mid-market sales reps, bringing our total to about 1,300 of mid-market sales headcount. 
Now we're not only modifying how we acquire customers, but we're also enhancing what we offer them. A growing percentage of our mid-market customers are taking advantage of our membership programs. These programs provide customized discounts and differentiated levels of service. The results are very encouraging, and we're seeing increased spend and loyalty from tens of thousands of businesses who have signed up for our membership program so far. 
And additionally, we're planning to utilize M&A as a growth catalyst. We've restarted our process of pursuing acquisitions to accelerate our mid-market strategy, and we're actively managing a strong pipeline of opportunities. 
Moving on to North American stores. Here, our top priority is to preserve profitability. Let me take a minute to give you some color on how we're managing the retail business. 
While our stores provide business customers with a level of service and convenience that differentiates Staples from the competition, I do want to be clear that we're not positioning our retail business as a key driver of long-term sales and earnings growth. That said, our stores generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and this cash is critical as we invest to reposition Staples by accelerating growth in mid-market and categories beyond office supplies. [ph] 
This year, our stores in North America are on track to generate over $200 million of free cash flow, which we're taking aggressive actions to preserve despite weak traffic. Our team is driving increased customer conversion, growing our high-margin copy and print and text service set; [ph] evolving our promotional strategies; optimizing our marketing spend; focusing on reducing fixed costs, in line with sales decline; driving double-digit growth in key omni-channel capabilities like buy online and pickup in store; [ph] and we're achieving record level of customer service. 
But at the same time, we know we need to respond to changing customer behavior by continuing to reduce our retail footprint. Over the past 3 years, we've closed more than 300 stores in North America, and we're on track to close at least 50 stores this year. And over the next 3 years, an average of 225 store leases will expire per year in North America. This gives us tremendous flexibility to continue rightsizing our store network as appropriate without incurring significant cash costs. 
Our third strategic priority is cost reduction. As you know, over the past 3 years, we've eliminated $750 million of annualized pretax costs. And while we've made great progress taking out costs, I know we can continue to do things better, faster and cheaper. To that end, I've asked our teams to challenge the way we work and not be afraid to take on calculated risks to achieve our savings goals. We've initiated a new multiyear cost savings plan, which is expected to generate an additional $300 million of annualized pretax cost savings by 2018. 
I'm excited about this work. Our biggest opportunities are reducing product costs, increasing our mix of higher margin Staples brand products, driving productivity in our supply chain and evolving our promotional strategies. Many of these new savings initiatives are already underway, and we are on track to achieve approximately $70 million of annualized pretax cost savings during 2016. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that we're progressing with our process to explore strategic alternatives for our European operation. John Wilson and his team have done a good job restructuring and streamlining Europe over the past few years, and this has positioned us very well.  We've seen a strong level of interest. And during Q2, our European management team met with a number of prospective buyers. We're currently working through due diligence, and we'll provide further details as the process continues. 
So to sum up, at Staples, we're in the early innings of a dynamic and pronounced strategic repositioning. We're moving from a product focus to a customer focus. We're moving from a retail culture to a delivery culture. We're evolving from a high-low pricing strategy to more everyday value. We're transitioning from a products company to a products and services company. We're utilizing M&A as a catalyst to augment our capabilities and drive growth, and we're narrowing our geographic footprint as we move from a broad international reach to a more pronounced focus on North America.  
And over the coming years, as we execute 2020, we will dramatically change the profile of our company. More than 95% of our sales will come from North America. More than 80% of our sales will be delivered, and more than 60% of our sales will come from categories beyond office supplies. [ph] 
So with that context, now let's take a quick look at Q2 results for each of our business units. Let's start with North America Commercial. Sales were up 1% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the sale of Staples Print Solutions business. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were flat versus last year at $2 billion.  In Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, Q2 sales grew 3% in local currency after excluding the headwind from the Staples Print Solutions sale. We continued to drive strong growth in categories beyond office supplies. [ph] Sales were up in the double digits in facility supplies, promotional products and breakroom supplies. We also drove mid-single-digit sales growth in technology. 
Staples Business Advantage sales in core categories like ink and toner were down in the mid-single digits, and sales of paper and office supplies declined in the low single digits. 
During Q2, North American Commercial operating income rate increased 40 basis points to 7.1%, and operating income grew by $8 million or about 6% compared to last year. This improvement primarily reflects lower labor costs, partially offset by lower product margin rates. We also closed on the sale of our noncore Staples Print Solutions in early January. And just as a reminder, we're planning for about a 4% headwind to our reported North American Commercial sales and about a 2% headwind to our reported total company sales until we anniversary this sale during Q2 of next year. 
Turning to North America Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 4%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 6% to $2 billion. During Q2, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 4%. This reflects 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 5% decline in same-store sales, primarily driven by a decline in customer traffic. 
Results in Canada were stronger than the U.S. in both stores and online. 
From a category perspective, the 4% decline in comparable sales during Q2 was almost entirely driven by ongoing weakness in tech categories like business machines and tech accessories, as well as ink and toner. These were all down in the mid to high single digits. For the rest of our categories, comparable sales in stores and online were down in the low single digit. 
North American Stores and Online operating income decreased 73 basis points to 0.6%. This reflects the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses in our stores, partially offset by improved profitability in Staples.com. 
We continued to rightsize our retail store network in North America, closing 19 stores in the U.S. during the first half of 2016. And I must note that the all-important back-to-school season is upon us with

or pick them up in store. We're also providing customers with the peace of mind that they're getting great value through our LESS List pricing and 110% lowest price guarantee. 
Finally, turning to International Operations. Sales decreased 4%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 7% year-over-year to $721 million versus last year. In Europe, sales remained soft and were down in the low double digits in local currency. Outside of Europe, our strongest results were in China, where sales were up in the strong double digits year-over-year. 
On the bottom line, operating income rate for International Operations increased 91 basis points to an operating loss of 1.9%. The team in Europe once again did a nice job managing expenses and drove the majority of our reduced International losses year-over-year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our Q2 financial results and outlook in more detail."
34740,369675961,1036402,"Staples, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Shira, and let me start off by providing a little bit more detail on our Q2 results. Total company sales for the second quarter were $4.8 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q2 of last year. This excludes",918,"Thanks, Shira, and let me start off by providing a little bit more detail on our Q2 results. Total company sales for the second quarter were $4.8 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q2 of last year. This excludes a 1% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from the combination of store closures in North America and the sale of our Staples Print Solutions business during the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% versus Q2 of last year. 
During the second quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.12, which was steady versus Q2 of last year. Our Q2 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $986 million, primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and other assets and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported net loss of $1.18 per share. During Q2, gross profit dollars decreased $67 million versus Q2 of last year, excluding a $4 million charge in Q2 of this year related to our decision to exit certain lines of business in our U.S. retail stores in connection with our strategic priority to preserve profitability. 
Non-GAAP gross profit rate for the second quarter decreased 43 basis points year-over-year to 25.2%. This primarily reflects lower product margin rate in North America Commercial and International Operations as well as the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses like rent and occupancy in our retail stores. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit rate decreased 52 basis points to 25.1% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. During Q2, total company SG&A decreased $67 million year-over-year after excluding $24 million of charges in Q2 of this year, primarily related to litigation as well as $10 million of charges, primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot during Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A rate declined 53 basis points year-over-year to 22.2%. This reflects lower labor costs due to headcount reduction and store closures and lower marketing expense. 
On a GAAP basis, SG&A rate decreased 25 basis points to 22.7% versus Q2 of last year. Excluding the impacts of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 2.7%. 
Now turning to our Q2 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q2 of 2015. This year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $102 million, a decrease of $36 million versus the prior year. With operating cash outflow of $11 million, our year-to-date free cash flow was an outflow of $113 million as of the end of the second quarter. Keep in mind that the breakup fee we paid to Office Depot as a result of the termination of the merger agreement was a $250 million operating cash outflow during the second quarter. We also made cash payments of about $90 million related to the Office Depot acquisition financing, which resulted in cash operating outflow during the first half of the year. These payments are tax deductible, and we do expect to realize the majority of the associated tax benefits in 2016. 
At the end of Q2, Staples had approximately $1.7 billion in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $775 million and available lines of credit of about $889 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We currently returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually for our cash dividend, and we are also balancing cash deployment through our share repurchases with our strong pipeline of M&A opportunities. 
When we announced our first quarter results, we were planning for share repurchases of approximately $100 million in 2016. But given the strength and the attractiveness of our tuck-in M&A opportunities, we chose to forgo purchasing shares during the second quarter and preserve our dry powder. 
Turning to our outlook. We remain on track to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decline versus Q3 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supply and in our contract businesses in North America. This will be offset by headwinds related to the sale of the Staples Print Solutions business as well as ongoing weakness in Europe, continued technology headwinds in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect third quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.32 to $0.35. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to the company's strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives as well as the ongoing of strategic alternatives for the company's European operations. 
We remain on track to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the after-tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. 
As Shira mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are positioning the company for sustainable, long-term sales and earnings growth as we execute our 2020 strategy. 
I'll now turn it back over to our conference call moderator, Kevin, for Q&A."

And this last quarter, it widened closer to 1,000 basis points. So we feel really good about our growth in Staples Business Advantage. It's driven by beyond office supply sales as well as customer acquisition. And just one  kind of fun factoid in this season of the Olympics, one of our beyond office supply categories was promotional products, and there's about 20 million pieces of T-shirts, water bottles, et cetera, currently at the Olympics that was produced and provided by Staples promotional products. So things like that are really driving growth from that side of the house."

One is Office Depot has gotten a lot more benefit from their store closures. They've done more in the past year. And because they were closing competitor stores, they were much more approximate and therefore, a higher transfer rate versus we were closing all of our own stores. So that accounts for about half of the gap, and I would say regarding the rest, well our 2-year stack comp actually improved from Q1 to Q2. So from a minus 9 to minus 8. I think we at Staples all feel that we can, and we'll do better on retails. We have many initiatives underway. The team is already doing well with conversion and market basket and customer satisfaction, but we believe that there's -- that we can do even better. And as I mentioned in my script, Steve Matyas is now leading that organization and is taking a fresh look at it as well as transferring a lot of our learnings from Canada."

So as an example: the delivery is a plus versus the warehouse clubs but, on the other hand, what's critical and what's really our differentiator is expertise and services, and that enables us to compete against a different set of competitors. The other thing I would say about mid-market, which I think we're somewhat unique in this space is it is the combination of the what I'd call the online and the offline that really gives us a unique and highly valued by customer offering. So we leverage our E-Commerce and digital capabilities that most folks are more familiar with through our public websites, but we have it on our private website. We've used the digital marketing, digital selling aids, but we also have the personal connection, whether it's literally in person in someone's office or be it telesales.

Absolutely, but I think we're also in a position that we play to our game, and we're very, very focused on our customers and what it's going to take to both win them and then grow them and keep them, and that's what consumes our conversations here. On store closures yes, obviously. When you're looking at stores, you're looking at the network and what's proximate and what's likely to close and what's not likely to close, and we have a great real estate team, and they take all that into account as we're making the store-by-store decision. But I also think that when you look at the strategies of the 2 companies, they are somewhat different at this point. I mean, we really are focusing on mid-market. We have a track record there. We're building our momentum. We're building on an offering that's already gaining share, and we're building on very profitable part of our business. So we've kind of said that's where we're going to double down. I don't sit in competitor boardrooms, but the feeling I got was their strategy was a lot more about continuing to double down on stores, and our strategy there is to preserve profitability."

This morning, we announced Q2 results that were right in line with our expectation. I'd like to start by thanking the entire Staples team for remaining focused and delivering solid results during quite an eventful quarter that included the termination of our proposed acquisition of Office Depot, the immediate launch of a new strategic plan and a change in leadership. 
Total company sales were down less than 2%, excluding the impact of store closures, changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of our contract print business. Non-GAAP operating income grew 2% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.12 was flat versus Q2 of last year despite a slightly higher effective tax rate and share count. 
But before I discuss Q2 results in more detail, I'd like to just take a few minutes to provide some color on my first 2 months in the new role. 
I take on this role with a great sense of urgency. When I joined Staples in 1992, we were in the process of creating our catalog business. And over the years, I've seen it grow organically and through acquisitions. At that time, we had only 174 stores, and we were still 6 years away from launching staples.com. 
So it goes without saying that a lot has changed over the past 24 years as Staples has evolved from a retail company with a fledgling delivery business to a delivery company with a retail business. And yet, for all the change that I've been part of, the most important thing about our company has remained constant--our commitment to our business customers and to transforming to meet their changing needs. 
So June 15 was my first day on the job, and I dove right in. My top priority is to position our company for sustainable, long-term sales and earnings growth. And we're doing that via our Staples 2020 strategy.  This strategy includes a dramatic change in our mindset and our operating model. We're doubling down on Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, where we have solid momentum on both the top and bottom line as well as a best-in-class offering to build on. At the same time, we're focusing on maximizing profitability and reducing risk in our underperforming retail and European businesses. 
I'm confident that our future is bright, and the reason I'm so confident is because our strengths so far outnumber our challenges. We have what we need to win. 
Nearly 2 million customers visit our websites and our stores everyday. We have a world-class distribution network that provides next-day delivery to business customers of all sizes. Half of our sales now come from categories beyond office supplies, and we have expertise in these adjacent categories that allows us to expand our share of wallet with customers. 
Well over half of our sales are generated online through our private and public websites. We have leading e-commerce and digital capabilities. Our brand is widely known and well-respected. Our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity to support our long-term growth priorities. And most importantly, we have an incredible team of engaged and committed associates. 
On May 11, we announced our Staples 2020 strategy, which builds on all the strengths which I just listed but also address our biggest challenges. We have 4 critical strategic priorities: First, we're focused on winning in the mid-market in North America. I've spent a lot of time on this business over the years, and I couldn't be more optimistic about this opportunity. Second, preserving profitability in our North American stores. Third, taking aggressive action to further reduce costs and drive efficiency across the organization. And fourth, narrowing our geographic focus to North America by exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. 
Now since launching Staples 2020, I've made some changes to our leadership team and our organizational structure to get the right talent in the right seats on the box. Joe Doody, our Vice Chairman, has assumed leadership for North American operations. You all know Joe. He's an 18-year Staples veteran, and he has been the key architect for building and leading high-performing teams across our North American delivery businesses for the majority of his time with the company. In his new role, Joe will focus on executing our Staples 2020 strategy, delivering on our 2016 financial goals and driving synergies and teamwork across our North American operations leadership team. 
During Q2, we also took an important step forward by more closely aligning staples.com and Staples Business Advantage under Neil Ringel, our Executive Vice President of Staples Business Advantage. Neil has been with Staples for 21 years, and for the last 5 years, has been leading our $7 billion North American contract organization and driving consistent growth. He is one of our most dynamic and capable leaders, and I'm excited about his expanded role. Also this improved alignment between SBA and dotcom will allow us to better serve our mid-market customers regardless of their ordering platform. 
As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we're focused on preserving profitability in our North American retail stores. Steve Matyas has been appointed President of North American Retail. Steve has over 25 years of experience at Staples, primarily leading our Canadian retail and online businesses. In his new role, Steve will also lead our U.S. retail business. His track record of delivering strong returns is well known across Staples. 
Finally, as we shared during Q1, John Wilson has taken on the additional responsibilities of driving our transformation for all of Staples, and he has been a real partner to me in doing so. 
And as our strategy evolves, I will continue making the changes necessary to put us in the best possible position to win. To that end, during Q2, we also held a company-wide leadership meeting to align the organization and make sure that each and every one of our leaders understood our new strategy and what was their role in making it happen. We've been adopting a transformation mindset, and I've been challenging the management team to lead with focus and accountability, speed and teamwork, what I call FAST, and have been delighted by the response and already visible changes in behavior. 
Now let me give you more color around the progress we've made on each of our Staples 2020 strategic priorities during Q2. Let's start with our top growth priority, winning in the mid-market in North America. 
We have a differentiated approach to serving mid-market customers where technology and innovation are at the core of our offering. This approach combines the personal touch of our sales force with digital selling tools and robust data on customer behavior and preferences.  Just to be clear, we define the mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees, and they are a sweet spot for us. These customers are often large enough that they have sophisticated needs, but too small to have the expertise or resources for all of their needs in-house. Historically, our key differentiators in the mid-market have been deep assortment, very competitive pricing and fast delivery. Today, these differentiators have become table stakes. To win, we need to do more.  So we are accelerating our mid-market growth by leveraging our expertise and evolving our approach to customer acquisition, and we made some nice progress here during Q2. Mid-market sales grew in the mid-single digits versus last year, and this was fueled by double-digit growth in categories beyond office supplies as well as strong customer acquisition. We've enhanced our digital marketing and sales support capabilities, and by doing so, we are shortening the customer acquisition process and can significantly reduce the cost of acquisition. We also plan to double our mid-market sales force over the next few years and year-to-date, have already added over 100 mid-market sales reps, bringing our total to about 1,300 of mid-market sales headcount. 
Now we're not only modifying how we acquire customers, but we're also enhancing what we offer them. A growing percentage of our mid-market customers are taking advantage of our membership programs. These programs provide customized discounts and differentiated levels of service. The results are very encouraging, and we're seeing increased spend and loyalty from tens of thousands of businesses who have signed up for our membership program so far. 
And additionally, we're planning to utilize M&A as a growth catalyst. We've restarted our process of pursuing acquisitions to accelerate our mid-market strategy, and we're actively managing a strong pipeline of opportunities. 
Moving on to North American stores. Here, our top priority is to preserve profitability. Let me take a minute to give you some color on how we're managing the retail business. 
While our stores provide business customers with a level of service and convenience that differentiates Staples from the competition, I do want to be clear that we're not positioning our retail business as a key driver of long-term sales and earnings growth. That said, our stores generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and this cash is critical as we invest to reposition Staples by accelerating growth in mid-market and categories beyond office supplies. 
This year, our stores in North America are on track to generate over $200 million of free cash flow, which we're taking aggressive actions to preserve despite weak traffic. Our team is driving increased customer conversion, growing our high-margin copy and print and text service sets; evolving our promotional strategies; optimizing our marketing spend; focusing on reducing fixed costs, in line with sales decline; driving double-digit growth in key omni-channel capabilities like buy online and pickup in store; and we're achieving record level of customer service. 
But at the same time, we know we need to respond to changing customer behavior by continuing to reduce our retail footprint. Over the past 3 years, we've closed more than 300 stores in North America, and we're on track to close at least 50 stores this year. And over the next 3 years, an average of 225 store leases will expire per year in North America. This gives us tremendous flexibility to continue rightsizing our store network as appropriate without incurring significant cash costs. 
Our third strategic priority is cost reduction. As you know, over the past 3 years, we've eliminated $750 million of annualized pretax costs. And while we've made great progress taking out costs, I know we can continue to do things better, faster and cheaper. To that end, I've asked our teams to challenge the way we work and not be afraid to take on calculated risks to achieve our savings goals. We've initiated a new multiyear cost savings plan, which is expected to generate an additional $300 million of annualized pretax cost savings by 2018. 
I'm excited about this work. Our biggest opportunities are reducing product costs, increasing our mix of higher margin Staples brand products, driving productivity in our supply chain and evolving our promotional strategies. Many of these new savings initiatives are already underway, and we are on track to achieve approximately $70 million of annualized pretax cost savings during 2016. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that we're progressing with our process to explore strategic alternatives for our European operation. John Wilson and his team have done a good job restructuring and streamlining Europe over the past few years, and this has positioned us very well.  We've seen a strong level of interest. And during Q2, our European management team met with a number of prospective buyers. We're currently working through due diligence, and we'll provide further details as the process continues. 
So to sum up, at Staples, we're in the early innings of a dynamic and pronounced strategic repositioning. We're moving from a product focus to a customer focus. We're moving from a retail culture to a delivery culture. We're evolving from a high-low pricing strategy to more everyday value. We're transitioning from a products company to a products and services company. We're utilizing M&A as a catalyst to augment our capabilities and drive growth, and we're narrowing our geographic footprint as we move from a broad international reach to a more pronounced focus on North America.  
And over the coming years, as we execute 2020, we will dramatically change the profile of our company. More than 95% of our sales will come from North America. More than 80% of our sales will be delivered, and more than 60% of our sales will come from categories beyond office supplies. 
So with that context, now let's take a quick look at Q2 results for each of our business units. Let's start with North America Commercial. Sales were up 1% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the sale of Staples Print Solutions business. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were flat versus last year at $2 billion.  In Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, Q2 sales grew 3% in local currency after excluding the headwind from the Staples Print Solutions sale. We continued to drive strong growth in categories beyond office supplies. Sales were up in the double digits in facility supplies, promotional products and breakroom supplies. We also drove mid-single-digit sales growth in technology. 
Staples Business Advantage sales in core categories like ink and toner were down in the mid-single digits, and sales of paper and office supplies declined in the low single digits. 
During Q2, North American Commercial operating income rate increased 40 basis points to 7.1%, and operating income grew by $8 million or about 6% compared to last year. This improvement primarily reflects lower labor costs, partially offset by lower product margin rates. We also closed on the sale of our noncore Staples Print Solutions in early January. And just as a reminder, we're planning for about a 4% headwind to our reported North American Commercial sales and about a 2% headwind to our reported total company sales until we anniversary this sale during Q2 of next year. 
Turning to North America Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 4%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 6% to $2 billion. During Q2, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 4%. This reflects 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 5% decline in same-store sales, primarily driven by a decline in customer traffic. 
Results in Canada were stronger than the U.S. in both stores and online. 
From a category perspective, the 4% decline in comparable sales during Q2 was almost entirely driven by ongoing weakness in tech categories like business machines and tech accessories, as well as ink and toner. These were all down in the mid to high single digits. For the rest of our categories, comparable sales in stores and online were down in the low single digit. 
North American Stores and Online operating income decreased 73 basis points to 0.6%. This reflects the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses in our stores, partially offset by improved profitability in Staples.com. 
We continued to rightsize our retail store network in North America, closing 19 stores in the U.S. during the first half of 2016. And I must note that the all-important back-to-school season is upon us with

or pick them up in store. We're also providing customers with the peace of mind that they're getting great value through our LESS List pricing and 110% lowest price guarantee. 
Finally, turning to International Operations. Sales decreased 4%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.  On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 7% year-over-year to $721 million versus last year. In Europe, sales remained soft and were down in the low double digits in local currency. Outside of Europe, our strongest results were in China, where sales were up in the strong double digits year-over-year. 
On the bottom line, operating income rate for International Operations increased 91 basis points to an operating loss of 1.9%. The team in Europe once again did a nice job managing expenses and drove the majority of our reduced International losses year-over-year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our Q2 financial results and outlook in more detail."
34740,369675961,1036444,"Staples, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Shira, and let me start off by providing a little bit more detail on our Q2 results. Total company sales for the second quarter were $4.8 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q2 of last year.

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q2 of last year. This excludes a 1% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from the combination of store closures in North America and the sale of our Staples Print Solutions business during the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% versus Q2 of last year. 
During the second quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.12, which was steady versus Q2 of last year. Our Q2 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $986 million, primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and other assets and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger.  On a GAAP basis, we reported net loss of $1.18 per share. 
During Q2, gross profit dollars decreased $67 million versus Q2 of last year, excluding a $4 million charge in Q2 of this year related to our decision to exit certain lines of business in our U.S. retail stores in connection with our strategic priority to preserve profitability. 
Non-GAAP gross profit rate for the second quarter decreased 43 basis points year-over-year to 25.2%. This primarily reflects lower product margin rate in North America Commercial and International Operations, as well as the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses like rent and occupancy in our retail stores. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit rate decreased 52 basis points to 25.1% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expense. During Q2, total company SG&A decreased $67 million year-over-year after excluding $24 million of charges in Q2 of this year, primarily related to litigation, as well as $10 million of charges primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot during Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A rate declined 53 basis points year-over-year to 22.2%. This reflects lower labor costs due to headcount reduction and store closures and lower marketing expense. 
On a GAAP basis, SG&A rate decreased 25 basis points to 22.7% versus Q2 of last year. Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 2.7%. 
Now turning to our Q2 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q2 of 2015. This year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $102 million, a decrease of $36 million versus the prior year. With operating cash outflow of $11 million, our year-to-date free cash flow was an outflow of $113 million as of the end of the second quarter. Keep in mind that the breakup fee we paid to Office Depot as a result of the termination of the merger agreement was a $250 million operating cash outflow during the second quarter. We also made cash payments of about $90 million related to the Office Depot acquisition financing, which resulted in cash operating outflow during the first half of the year. These payments are tax deductible, and we do expect to realize the majority of the associated tax benefits in 2016. 
At the end of Q2, Staples had approximately $1.7 billion in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $775 million and available lines of credit of about $889 million. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We currently returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually for our cash dividend, and we are also balancing cash deployment through our share repurchases with our strong pipeline of M&A opportunities. 
When we announced our first quarter results, we were planning for share repurchases of approximately $100 million in 2016. But given the strength and the attractiveness of our tuck-in M&A opportunities, we chose to forgo purchasing shares during the second quarter and preserve our dry powder. 
Turning to our outlook. We remain on track to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decline versus Q3 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our contract businesses in North America. This will be offset by headwinds related to the sale of the Staples Print Solutions business, as well as ongoing weakness in Europe, continued technology headwinds in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect third quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.32 to $0.35. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to the company's strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives, as well as the ongoing of strategic alternatives for the company's European operations. 
We remain on track to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the after-tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. 
As Shira mentioned, at the beginning of the call, we are positioning the company for sustainable, long-term sales and earnings growth as we execute our 2020 strategy. 
I'll now turn it back over to our conference call moderator, Kevin, for Q&A."

And this last quarter, it widened closer to 1,000 basis points. So we feel really good about our growth in Staples Business Advantage. It's driven by BOS, beyond office supplies sales, as well as customer acquisition. And just one kind of fun factoid in this season of the Olympics, one of our beyond office supplies categories was promotional products, and there's about 20 million pieces of flags, T-shirts, water bottles, et cetera, currently at the Olympics that was produced and provided by Staples promotional products. So things like that are really driving growth from that side of the house."

So that accounts for about half of the gap. And I would say regarding the rest, well, our 2-year stacked comp actually improved from Q1 to Q2. So from a minus 9 to a minus 8. I think we at Staples all feel that we can and we'll do better on retail. We have many initiatives underway. The team is already doing well with conversion and market basket and customer satisfaction, but we believe that there's -- that we can do even better.

You mentioned the need or the attempt to strike the right balance of investments in retail to preserve the cash flow. I guess, looking back over the last several years, is there anything that could have been done different, the pace of store closings?

And we have a great real estate team, and they take all that into account as we're making the store-by-store decisions. But I also think that when you look at the strategies of the 2 companies, they are somewhat different at this point. I mean, we really are focusing on mid-market. We have a track record there. We're building our momentum. We're building on an offering that's already gaining share. And we're building on a very profitable part of our business.

This morning, we announced Q2 results that were right in line with our expectation. I'd like to start by thanking the entire Staples team for remaining focused and delivering solid results during quite an eventful quarter that included the termination of our proposed acquisition of Office Depot, the immediate launch of a new strategic plan and a change in leadership. 
Total company sales were down less than 2%, excluding the impact of store closures, changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of our contract print business. Non-GAAP operating income grew 2% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.12 was flat versus Q2 of last year despite a slightly higher effective tax rate and share count. 
But before I discuss Q2 results in more detail, I'd like to just take a few minutes to provide some color on my first 2 months in the new role. 
I take on this role with a great sense of urgency. When I joined Staples in 1992, we were in the process of creating our catalog business. And over the years, I've seen it grow organically and through acquisition. At that time, we had only 174 stores, and we were still 6 years away from launching staples.com. 
So it goes without saying that a lot has changed over the past 24 years as Staples has evolved from a retail company with a fledgling delivery business to a delivery company with a retail business. And yet, for all the change that I've been part of, the most important thing about our company has remained constant--our commitment to our business customers and to transforming to meet their changing needs. 
So June 15 was my first day on the job, and I dove right in. My top priority is to position our company for sustainable, long-term sales and earnings growth. And we're doing that via our Staples 2020 strategy.  The strategy includes a dramatic change in our mindset and our operating model. We're doubling down on Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, where we have solid momentum on both the top and bottom line as well as a best-in-class offering to build on. At the same time, we're focusing on maximizing profitability and reducing risk in our underperforming retail and European businesses. 
I'm confident that our future is bright, and the reason I'm so confident is because our strengths so far outnumber our challenges. We have what we need to win. 
Nearly 2 million customers visit our website and our stores every day. We have a world-class distribution network that provides next-day delivery to business customers of all sizes. Half of our sales now come from categories beyond office supplies, and we have expertise in these adjacent categories that allows us to expand our share of wallet with customers. 
Well over half of our sales are generated online through our private and public websites. We have leading e-commerce and digital capabilities. Our brand is widely known and well-respected. Our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity to support our long-term growth priorities. And most importantly, we have an incredible team of engaged and committed associates. 
On May 11, we announced our Staples 2020 strategy, which builds on all the strengths which I just listed but also addresses our biggest challenges. We have 4 critical strategic priorities: First, we're focused on winning in the mid-market in North America. I've spent a lot of time on this business over the years, and I couldn't be more optimistic about this opportunity. Second, preserving profitability in our North American stores. Third, taking aggressive action to further reduce costs and drive efficiency across the organization. And fourth, narrowing our geographic focus to North America by exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. 
Now since launching Staples 2020, I've made some changes to our leadership team and our organizational structure to get the right talent in the right seats on the box [ph]. Joe Doody, our Vice Chairman, has assumed leadership for North American operations. You all know Joe. He's an 18-year Staples veteran, and he has been the key architect for building and leading high-performing teams across our North American delivery businesses for the majority of his time with the company. In his new role, Joe will focus on executing our Staples 2020 strategy, delivering on our 2016 financial goals and driving synergies and teamwork across our North American operations leadership team. 
During Q2, we also took an important step forward by more closely aligning staples.com and Staples Business Advantage under Neil Ringel, our Executive Vice President of Staples Business Advantage. Neil has been with Staples for 21 years, and for the last 5 years, has been leading our $7 billion North American contract organization and driving consistent growth. He is one of our most dynamic and capable leaders, and I'm excited about his expanded role. Also this improved alignment between SBA and .com will allow us to better serve our mid-market customers regardless of their ordering platform. 
As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we're focused on preserving profitability in our North American retail stores. Steve Matyas has been appointed President of North American Retail. Steve has over 25 years of experience with Staples, primarily leading our Canadian retail and online businesses. In his new role, Steve will also lead our U.S. retail business. His track record of delivering strong returns is well known across Staples. 
Finally, as we shared during Q1, John Wilson has taken on the additional responsibilities of driving our transformation for all of Staples, and he has been a real partner to me in doing so. 
And as our strategy evolves, I will continue making the changes necessary to put us in the best possible position to win. To that end, during Q2, we also held a company-wide leadership meeting to align the organization and make sure that each and every one of our leaders understood our new strategy and what was their role in making it happen. We've been adopting a transformation mindset, and I've been challenging the management team to lead with focus and accountability, speed and teamwork, what I call FAST, and have been delighted by the response and already visible changes in behavior. 
Now let me give you more color around the progress we've made on each of our Staples 2020 strategic priorities during Q2. Let's start with our top growth priority, winning in the mid-market in North America. 
We have a differentiated approach to serving mid-market customers where technology and innovation are at the core of our offering. This approach combines the personal touch of our sales force with digital selling tools and robust data on customer behavior and preferences.  Just to be clear, we define the mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees, and they are a sweet spot for us. These customers are often large enough that they have sophisticated needs, but too small to have the expertise or resources for all of their needs in-house. Historically, our key differentiators in the mid-market have been deep assortment, very competitive pricing and fast delivery. Today, these differentiators have become table stakes. To win, we need to do more.  So we are accelerating our mid-market growth by leveraging our expertise and evolving our approach to customer acquisition, and we made some nice progress here during Q2. Mid-market sales grew in the mid-single digits versus last year, and this was fueled by double-digit growth in categories beyond office supplies as well as strong customer acquisition. We've enhanced our digital marketing and sales support capabilities, and by doing so, we are shortening the customer acquisition process and can significantly reduce the cost of acquisition. We also plan to double our mid-market sales force over the next few years and year-to-date, have already added over 100 mid-market sales reps, bringing our total to about 1,300 of mid-market sales headcount. 
Now we're not only modifying how we acquire customers, but we're also enhancing what we offer them. A growing percentage of our mid-market customers are taking advantage of our membership programs. These programs provide customized discounts and differentiated levels of service. The results are very encouraging, and we're seeing increased spend and loyalty from tens of thousands of businesses who have signed up for our membership program so far. 
And additionally, we're planning to utilize M&A as a growth catalyst. We've restarted our process of pursuing acquisitions to accelerate our mid-market strategy, and we're actively managing a strong pipeline of opportunities. 
Moving on to North American stores. Here, our top priority is to preserve profitability. Let me take a minute to give you some color on how we're managing the retail business. 
While our stores provide business customers with a level of service and convenience that differentiates Staples from the competition, I do want to be clear that we're not positioning our retail business as a key driver of long-term sales and earnings growth. That said, our stores generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and this cash is critical as we invest to reposition Staples by accelerating growth in mid-market and categories beyond office supplies. 
This year, our stores in North America are on track to generate over $200 million of free cash flow, which we're taking aggressive actions to preserve despite weak traffic. Our team is driving increased customer conversion, growing our high-margin copy and print and text service set; evolving our promotional strategies; optimizing our marketing spend; focusing on reducing fixed costs, in line with sales decline; driving double-digit growth in key omni-channel capabilities like buy online and pickup in store; and we're achieving record levels of customer service. 
But at the same time, we know we need to respond to changing customer behavior by continuing to reduce our retail footprint. Over the past 3 years, we've closed more than 300 stores in North America, and we're on track to close at least 50 stores this year. And over the next 3 years, an average of 225 store leases will expire per year in North America. This gives us tremendous flexibility to continue rightsizing our store network as appropriate without incurring significant cash costs. 
Our third strategic priority is cost reduction. As you know, over the past 3 years, we've eliminated $750 million of annualized pretax costs. And while we've made great progress taking out costs, I know we can continue to do things better, faster and cheaper. To that end, I've asked our teams to challenge the way we work and not be afraid to take on calculated risks to achieve our savings goals. We've initiated a new multiyear cost savings plan, which is expected to generate an additional $300 million of annualized pretax cost savings by 2018. 
I'm excited about this work. Our biggest opportunities are reducing product costs, increasing our mix of higher margin Staples brand products, driving productivity in our supply chain and evolving our promotional strategies. Many of these new savings initiatives are already underway, and we are on track to achieve approximately $70 million of annualized pretax cost savings during 2016. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that we're progressing with our process to explore strategic alternatives for our European operation. John Wilson and his team have done a good job restructuring and streamlining Europe over the past few years, and this has positioned us very well.  We've seen a strong level of interest. And during Q2, our European management team met with a number of prospective buyers. We're currently working through due diligence and will provide further details as the process continues. 
So to sum up, at Staples, we're in the early innings of a dynamic and pronounced strategic repositioning. We're moving from a product focus to a customer focus. We're moving from a retail culture to a delivery culture. We're evolving from a high-low pricing strategy to more everyday value. We're transitioning from a products company to a products and services company. We're utilizing M&A as a catalyst to augment our capabilities and drive growth, and we're narrowing our geographic footprint as we move from a broad international reach to a more pronounced focus on North America.  
And over the coming years, as we execute 2020, we will dramatically change the profile of our company. More than 95% of our sales will come from North America. More than 80% of our sales will be delivered, and more than 60% of our sales will come from categories beyond office supplies. 
So with that context, now let's take a quick look at Q2 results for each of our business units. Let's start with North America Commercial. Sales were up 1% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the sale of Staples Print Solutions business. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were flat versus last year at $2 billion.  In Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, Q2 sales grew 3% in local currency after excluding the headwind from the Staples Print Solutions sale. We continued to drive strong growth in categories beyond office supplies. Sales were up in the double digits in facility supplies, promotional products and breakroom supplies. We also drove mid-single-digit sales growth in technology. 
Staples Business Advantage sales in core categories like ink and toner were down in the mid-single digits, and sales of paper and office supplies declined in the low single digits. 
During Q2, North American Commercial operating income rate increased 40 basis points to 7.1%, and operating income grew by $8 million or about 6% compared to last year. This improvement primarily reflects lower labor costs, partially offset by lower product margin rates. We also closed on the sale of our noncore Staples Print Solutions in early January. And just as a reminder, we're planning for about a 4% headwind to our reported North American Commercial sales and about a 2% headwind to our reported total company sales until we anniversary the sale during Q2 of next year. 
Turning to North America Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 4%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 6% to $2 billion. During Q2, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 4%. This reflects 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 5% decline in same-store sales, primarily driven by a decline in customer traffic. 
Results in Canada were stronger than the U.S. in both stores and online. 
From a category perspective, the 4% decline in comparable sales during Q2 was almost entirely driven by ongoing weakness in tech categories like business machines and tech accessories, as well as ink and toner. These were all down in the mid to high single digits. For the rest of our categories, comparable sales in stores and online were down in the low single digit. 
North American Stores and Online operating income decreased 73 basis points to 0.6%. This reflects the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses in our stores, partially offset by improved profitability in Staples.com. 
We continued to rightsize our retail store network in North America, closing 19 stores in the U.S. during the first half of 2016. And I must note that the all-important back-to-school season is upon us with 
[Audio Gap]
or pick them up in store. We're also providing customers with the peace of mind that they're getting great value through our LESS List pricing and 110% lowest price guarantee. 
Finally, turning to International Operations. Sales decreased 4%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.  On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 7% year-over-year to $721 million versus last year. In Europe, sales remained soft and were down in the low double digits in local currency. Outside of Europe, our strongest results were in China, where sales were up in the strong double digits year-over-year. 
On the bottom line, operating income rate for International Operations increased 91 basis points to an operating loss of 1.9%. The team in Europe once again did a nice job managing expenses and drove the majority of our reduced International losses year-over-year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our Q2 financial results and outlook in more detail."

This excludes",918,"Thanks, Shira, and let me start off by providing a little bit more detail on our Q2 results. Total company sales for the second quarter were $4.8 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q2 of last year. This excludes a 1% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from the combination of store closures in North America and the sale of our Staples Print Solutions business during the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% versus Q2 of last year. 
During the second quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.12, which was steady versus Q2 of last year. Our Q2 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $986 million, primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and other assets and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger.  On a GAAP basis, we reported net loss of $1.18 per share. 
During Q2, gross profit dollars decreased $67 million versus Q2 of last year, excluding a $4 million charge in Q2 of this year related to our decision to exit certain lines of business in our U.S. retail stores in connection with our strategic priority to preserve profitability. 
Non-GAAP gross profit rate for the second quarter decreased 43 basis points year-over-year to 25.2%. This primarily reflects lower product margin rate in North America Commercial and International Operations, as well as the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses like rent and occupancy in our retail stores. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit rate decreased 52 basis points to 25.1% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expense. During Q2, total company SG&A decreased $67 million year-over-year after excluding $24 million of charges in Q2 of this year, primarily related to litigation, as well as $10 million of charges primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot during Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A rate declined 53 basis points year-over-year to 22.2%. This reflects lower labor costs due to headcount reduction and store closures and lower marketing expense. 
On a GAAP basis, SG&A rate decreased 25 basis points to 22.7% versus Q2 of last year. Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 2.7%. 
Now turning to our Q2 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q2 of 2015. This year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $102 million, a decrease of $36 million versus the prior year. With operating cash outflow of $11 million, our year-to-date free cash flow was an outflow of $113 million as of the end of the second quarter. Keep in mind that the breakup fee we paid to Office Depot as a result of the termination of the merger agreement was a $250 million operating cash outflow during the second quarter. We also made cash payments of about $90 million related to the Office Depot acquisition financing, which resulted in cash operating outflow during the first half of the year. These payments are tax deductible, and we do expect to realize the majority of the associated tax benefit in 2016. 
At the end of Q2, Staples had approximately $1.7 billion in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $775 million and available lines of credit of about $889 million. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We currently returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually through our cash dividend, and we are also balancing cash deployment through our share repurchases with our strong pipeline of M&A opportunities. 
When we announced our first quarter results, we were planning for share repurchases of approximately $100 million in 2016. But given the strength and the attractiveness of our tuck-in M&A opportunities, we chose to forgo purchasing shares during the second quarter and preserve our dry powder. 
Turning to our outlook. We remain on track to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decline versus Q3 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our contract businesses in North America. This will be offset by headwinds related to the sale of the Staples Print Solutions business, as well as ongoing weakness in Europe, continued technology headwinds in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect third quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.32 to $0.35. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to the company's strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives, as well as the ongoing of strategic alternatives for the company's European operations. 
We remain on track to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the after-tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. 
As Shira mentioned, at the beginning of the call, we are positioning the company for sustainable, long-term sales and earnings growth as we execute our 2020 strategy. 
I'll now turn it back over to our conference call moderator, Kevin, for Q&A."

And this last quarter, it widened closer to 1,000 basis points. So we feel really good about our growth in Staples Business Advantage. It's driven by BOS, beyond office supplies sales, as well as customer acquisition. And just one kind of fun factoid in the season of the Olympics, one of our beyond office supplies categories is promotional products, and there's about 20 million pieces of swag, T-shirts, water bottles, et cetera, currently at the Olympics that was produced and provided by Staples promotional products.

And we have a great real estate team, and they take all that into account as we're making the store-by-store decisions.

But I think it will continue to be competitive as it has been in the past."

This morning, we announced Q2 results that were right in line with our expectation. I'd like to start by thanking the entire Staples team for remaining focused and delivering solid results during quite an eventful quarter that included the termination of our proposed acquisition of Office Depot, the immediate launch of a new strategic plan and a change in leadership. 
Total company sales were down less than 2%, excluding the impact of store closures, changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of our contract print business. Non-GAAP operating income grew 2% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.12 was flat versus Q2 of last year despite a slightly higher effective tax rate and share count. 
But before I discuss Q2 results in more detail, I'd like to just take a few minutes to provide some color on my first 2 months in the new role. 
I take on this role with a great sense of urgency. When I joined Staples in 1992, we were in the process of creating our catalog business. And over the years, I've seen it grow organically and through acquisition. At that time, we had only 174 stores, and we were still 6 years away from launching staples.com. 
So it goes without saying that a lot has changed over the past 24 years as Staples has evolved from a retail company with a fledgling delivery business to a delivery company with a retail business. And yet, for all the change that I've been part of, the most important thing about our company has remained constant--our commitment to our business customers and to transforming to meet their changing needs. 
So June 15 was my first day on the job, and I dove right in. My top priority is to position our company for sustainable, long-term sales and earnings growth. And we're doing that via our Staples 2020 strategy.  The strategy includes a dramatic change in our mindset and our operating model. We're doubling down on Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, where we have solid momentum on both the top and bottom line as well as a best-in-class offering to build on. At the same time, we're focusing on maximizing profitability and reducing risk in our underperforming retail and European businesses. 
I'm confident that our future is bright, and the reason I'm so confident is because our strengths so far outnumber our challenges. We have what we need to win. 
Nearly 2 million customers visit our website and our stores every day. We have a world-class distribution network that provides next-day delivery to business customers of all sizes. Half of our sales now come from categories beyond office supplies, and we have expertise in these adjacent categories that allows us to expand our share of wallet with customers. 
Well over half of our sales are generated online through our private and public websites. We have leading e-commerce and digital capabilities. Our brand is widely known and well-respected. Our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity to support our long-term growth priorities. And most importantly, we have an incredible team of engaged and committed associates. 
On May 11, we announced our Staples 2020 strategy, which builds on all the strengths which I just listed but also addresses our biggest challenges. We have 4 critical strategic priorities: First, we're focused on winning in the mid-market in North America. I've spent a lot of time on this business over the years, and I couldn't be more optimistic about this opportunity. Second, preserving profitability in our North American stores. Third, taking aggressive action to further reduce costs and drive efficiency across the organization. And fourth, narrowing our geographic focus to North America by exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. 
Now since launching Staples 2020, I've made some changes to our leadership team and our organizational structure to get the right talent in the right seats on the box [ph]. Joe Doody, our Vice Chairman, has assumed leadership for North American operations. You all know Joe. He's an 18-year Staples veteran, and he has been the key architect for building and leading high-performing teams across our North American delivery businesses for the majority of his time with the company. In his new role, Joe will focus on executing our Staples 2020 strategy, delivering on our 2016 financial goals and driving synergies and teamwork across our North American operations leadership team. 
During Q2, we also took an important step forward by more closely aligning staples.com and Staples Business Advantage under Neil Ringel, our Executive Vice President of Staples Business Advantage. Neil has been with Staples for 21 years, and for the last 5 years, has been leading our $7 billion North American contract organization and driving consistent growth. He is one of our most dynamic and capable leaders, and I'm excited about his expanded role. Also this improved alignment between SBA and .com will allow us to better serve our mid-market customers regardless of their ordering platform. 
As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we're focused on preserving profitability in our North American retail stores. Steve Matyas has been appointed President of North American Retail. Steve has over 25 years of experience with Staples, primarily leading our Canadian retail and online businesses. In his new role, Steve will also lead our U.S. retail business. His track record of delivering strong returns is well known across Staples. 
Finally, as we shared during Q1, John Wilson has taken on the additional responsibilities of driving our transformation for all of Staples, and he has been a real partner to me in doing so. 
And as our strategy evolves, I will continue making the changes necessary to put us in the best possible position to win. To that end, during Q2, we also held a company-wide leadership meeting to align the organization and make sure that each and every one of our leaders understood our new strategy and what was their role in making it happen. We've been adopting a transformation mindset, and I've been challenging the management team to lead with focus and accountability, speed and teamwork, what I call FAST, and have been delighted by the response and already visible changes in behavior. 
Now let me give you more color around the progress we've made on each of our Staples 2020 strategic priorities during Q2. Let's start with our top growth priority, winning in the mid-market in North America. 
We have a differentiated approach to serving mid-market customers where technology and innovation are at the core of our offering. This approach combines the personal touch of our sales force with digital selling tools and robust data on customer behavior and preferences.  Just to be clear, we define the mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees, and they are a sweet spot for us. These customers are often large enough that they have sophisticated needs, but too small to have the expertise or resources for all of their needs in-house. Historically, our key differentiators in the mid-market have been deep assortment, very competitive pricing and fast delivery. Today, these differentiators have become table stakes. To win, we need to do more.  So we are accelerating our mid-market growth by leveraging our expertise and evolving our approach to customer acquisition, and we made some nice progress here during Q2. Mid-market sales grew in the mid-single digits versus last year, and this was fueled by double-digit growth in categories beyond office supplies as well as strong customer acquisition. We've enhanced our digital marketing and sales support capabilities, and by doing so, we are shortening the customer acquisition process and can significantly reduce the cost of acquisition. We also plan to double our mid-market sales force over the next few years and year-to-date, have already added over 100 mid-market sales reps, bringing our total to about 1,300 of mid-market sales headcount. 
Now we're not only modifying how we acquire customers, but we're also enhancing what we offer them. A growing percentage of our mid-market customers are taking advantage of our membership programs. These programs provide customized discounts and differentiated levels of service. The results are very encouraging, and we're seeing increased spend and loyalty from tens of thousands of businesses who have signed up for our membership program so far. 
And additionally, we're planning to utilize M&A as a growth catalyst. We've restarted our process of pursuing acquisitions to accelerate our mid-market strategy, and we're actively managing a strong pipeline of opportunities. 
Moving on to North American stores. Here, our top priority is to preserve profitability. Let me take a minute to give you some color on how we're managing the retail business. 
While our stores provide business customers with a level of service and convenience that differentiates Staples from the competition, I do want to be clear that we're not positioning our retail business as a key driver of long-term sales and earnings growth. That said, our stores generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and this cash is critical as we invest to reposition Staples by accelerating growth in mid-market and categories beyond office supplies. 
This year, our stores in North America are on track to generate over $200 million of free cash flow, which we're taking aggressive actions to preserve despite weak traffic. Our team is driving increased customer conversion, growing our high-margin copy and print and text service set; evolving our promotional strategies; optimizing our marketing spend; focusing on reducing fixed costs, in line with sales decline; driving double-digit growth in key omni-channel capabilities like buy online and pickup in store; and we're achieving record levels of customer service. 
But at the same time, we know we need to respond to changing customer behavior by continuing to reduce our retail footprint. Over the past 3 years, we've closed more than 300 stores in North America, and we're on track to close at least 50 stores this year. And over the next 3 years, an average of 225 store leases will expire per year in North America. This gives us tremendous flexibility to continue rightsizing our store network as appropriate without incurring significant cash costs. 
Our third strategic priority is cost reduction. As you know, over the past 3 years, we've eliminated $750 million of annualized pretax costs. And while we've made great progress taking out costs, I know we can continue to do things better, faster and cheaper. To that end, I've asked our teams to challenge the way we work and not be afraid to take on calculated risks to achieve our savings goals. We've initiated a new multiyear cost savings plan, which is expected to generate an additional $300 million of annualized pretax cost savings by 2018. 
I'm excited about this work. Our biggest opportunities are reducing product costs, increasing our mix of higher margin Staples brand products, driving productivity in our supply chain and evolving our promotional strategies. Many of these new savings initiatives are already underway, and we are on track to achieve approximately $70 million of annualized pretax cost savings during 2016. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that we're progressing with our process to explore strategic alternatives for our European operation. John Wilson and his team have done a good job restructuring and streamlining Europe over the past few years, and this has positioned us very well.  We've seen a strong level of interest. And during Q2, our European management team met with a number of prospective buyers. We're currently working through due diligence and will provide further details as the process continues. 
So to sum up, at Staples, we're in the early innings of a dynamic and pronounced strategic repositioning. We're moving from a product focus to a customer focus. We're moving from a retail culture to a delivery culture. We're evolving from a high-low pricing strategy to more everyday value. We're transitioning from a products company to a products and services company. We're utilizing M&A as a catalyst to augment our capabilities and drive growth, and we're narrowing our geographic footprint as we move from a broad international reach to a more pronounced focus on North America.  
And over the coming years, as we execute 2020, we will dramatically change the profile of our company. More than 95% of our sales will come from North America. More than 80% of our sales will be delivered, and more than 60% of our sales will come from categories beyond office supplies. 
So with that context, now let's take a quick look at Q2 results for each of our business units. Let's start with North America Commercial. Sales were up 1% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the sale of Staples Print Solutions business. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were flat versus last year at $2 billion.  In Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, Q2 sales grew 3% in local currency after excluding the headwind from the Staples Print Solutions sale. We continued to drive strong growth in categories beyond office supplies. Sales were up in the double digits in facility supplies, promotional products and breakroom supplies. We also drove mid-single-digit sales growth in technology. 
Staples Business Advantage sales in core categories like ink and toner were down in the mid-single digits, and sales of paper and office supplies declined in the low single digits. 
During Q2, North American Commercial operating income rate increased 40 basis points to 7.1%, and operating income grew by $8 million or about 6% compared to last year. This improvement primarily reflects lower labor costs, partially offset by lower product margin rates. We also closed on the sale of our noncore Staples Print Solutions in early January. And just as a reminder, we're planning for about a 4% headwind to our reported North American Commercial sales and about a 2% headwind to our reported total company sales until we anniversary the sale during Q2 of next year. 
Turning to North America Stores and Online. Sales declined approximately 4%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and store closures. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 6% to $2 billion. During Q2, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 4%. This reflects 1% local currency sales growth in Staples.com and a 5% decline in same-store sales, primarily driven by a decline in customer traffic. 
Results in Canada were stronger than the U.S. in both stores and online. 
From a category perspective, the 4% decline in comparable sales during Q2 was almost entirely driven by ongoing weakness in tech categories like business machines and tech accessories, as well as ink and toner. These were all down in the mid to high single digits. For the rest of our categories, comparable sales in stores and online were down in the low single digit. 
North American Stores and Online operating income decreased 73 basis points to 0.6%. This reflects the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses in our stores, partially offset by improved profitability in Staples.com. 
We continued to rightsize our retail store network in North America, closing 19 stores in the U.S. during the first half of 2016. And I must note that the all-important back-to-school season is upon us with 
[Audio Gap]
or pick them up in store. We're also providing customers with the peace of mind that they're getting great value through our LESS List pricing and 110% lowest price guarantee. 
Finally, turning to International Operations. Sales decreased 4%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.  On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 7% year-over-year to $721 million versus last year. In Europe, sales remained soft and were down in the low double digits in local currency. Outside of Europe, our strongest results were in China, where sales were up in the strong double digits year-over-year. 
On the bottom line, operating income rate for International Operations increased 91 basis points to an operating loss of 1.9%. The team in Europe once again did a nice job managing expenses and drove the majority of our reduced International losses year-over-year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our Q2 financial results and outlook in more detail."

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q2 of last year. This excludes a 1% headwind from changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1% headwind from the combination of store closures in North America and the sale of our Staples Print Solutions business during the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% versus Q2 of last year. 
During the second quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.12, which was steady versus Q2 of last year. Our Q2 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $986 million, primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and other assets and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger.  On a GAAP basis, we reported net loss of $1.18 per share. 
During Q2, gross profit dollars decreased $67 million versus Q2 of last year, excluding a $4 million charge in Q2 of this year related to our decision to exit certain lines of business in our U.S. retail stores in connection with our strategic priority to preserve profitability. 
Non-GAAP gross profit rate for the second quarter decreased 43 basis points year-over-year to 25.2%. This primarily reflects lower product margin rate in North America Commercial and International Operations, as well as the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses like rent and occupancy in our retail stores. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit rate decreased 52 basis points to 25.1% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expense. During Q2, total company SG&A decreased $67 million year-over-year after excluding $24 million of charges in Q2 of this year, primarily related to litigation, as well as $10 million of charges primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot during Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A rate declined 53 basis points year-over-year to 22.2%. This reflects lower labor costs due to headcount reduction and store closures and lower marketing expense. 
On a GAAP basis, SG&A rate decreased 25 basis points to 22.7% versus Q2 of last year. Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating margin rate increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 2.7%. 
Now turning to our Q2 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q2 of 2015. This year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $102 million, a decrease of $36 million versus the prior year. With operating cash outflow of $11 million, our year-to-date free cash flow was an outflow of $113 million as of the end of the second quarter. Keep in mind that the breakup fee we paid to Office Depot as a result of the termination of the merger agreement was a $250 million operating cash outflow during the second quarter. We also made cash payments of about $90 million related to the Office Depot acquisition financing, which resulted in cash operating outflow during the first half of the year. These payments are tax deductible, and we do expect to realize the majority of the associated tax benefit in 2016. 
At the end of Q2, Staples had approximately $1.7 billion in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents of $775 million and available lines of credit of about $889 million. 
We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We currently returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually through our cash dividend, and we are also balancing cash deployment through our share repurchases with our strong pipeline of M&A opportunities. 
When we announced our first quarter results, we were planning for share repurchases of approximately $100 million in 2016. But given the strength and the attractiveness of our tuck-in M&A opportunities, we chose to forgo purchasing shares during the second quarter and preserve our dry powder. 
Turning to our outlook. We remain on track to get back to earnings growth in 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decline versus Q3 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our contract businesses in North America. This will be offset by headwinds related to the sale of the Staples Print Solutions business, as well as ongoing weakness in Europe, continued technology headwinds in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect third quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.32 to $0.35. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to the company's strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives, as well as the ongoing of strategic alternatives for the company's European operations. 
We remain on track to generate approximately $600 million of free cash flow in 2016. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the after-tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. 
As Shira mentioned, at the beginning of the call, we are positioning the company for sustainable, long-term sales and earnings growth as we execute our 2020 strategy. 
I'll now turn it back over to our conference call moderator, Kevin, for Q&A."

And this last quarter, it widened closer to 1,000 basis points. So we feel really good about our growth in Staples Business Advantage. It's driven by BOS, beyond office supplies sales, as well as customer acquisition. And just one kind of fun factoid in the season of the Olympics, one of our beyond office supplies categories is promotional products, and there's about 20 million pieces of swag, T-shirts, water bottles, et cetera, currently at the Olympics that was produced and provided by Staples promotional products.

The team is already doing well with conversion and market basket and customer satisfaction, but we believe that there's -- that we can do even better.

So there really isn't a lot of plans to build out internationally more. And regarding the rest of it is, listen, do we look at all of our competitors? Absolutely. But I think we're also in the position that we play to our game. And we're very, very focused on our customers and what it's going to take to both win them and then grow them and keep them, and that's what consumes our conversations here. On store closures yes, obviously, when you're looking at stores, you're looking at the network and what's proximate and what's likely to close and what's not likely to close. And we have a great real estate team, and they take all that into account as we're making the store-by-store decisions. But I also think that when you look at the strategies of the 2 companies, they are somewhat different at this point. I mean, we really are focusing on mid-market. We have a track record there. We're building our momentum. We're building on an offering that's already gaining share. And we're building on a very profitable part of our business. So we've kind of said that's where we're going to double down. I don't sit in competitor boardrooms, but the feeling I got was their strategy was a lot more about continuing to double down on stores, and our strategy there is to preserve profitability."

This morning, we announced third quarter results that were right in line with our expectations. 
Starting on Slide 3, let's take a quick look at the headline. Total company sales were down 2% excluding the impact of store closures, changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of Staples Print Solutions during Q2 of this year. We continue to drive steady growth in Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, with Q3 sales up 2% in local currency after excluding the headwind from Staples Print Solutions. This was led by growth in our mid-market and had a growth [ph] beyond office supply. 
Non-GAAP operating income rate, it improved 22 basis points, and we drove improved operating income rate across all of our business units versus last year. We achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 versus $0.35 during Q3 of last year. We ended Q3 with $2.2 billion of liquidity, including $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We've increased our full year free cash flow guidance from $600 million to $700 million. Our Board of Directors concluded their CEO search process and appointed me as Staples' Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. 
And in Q4, we've already been busy. We completed 3 transactions that, taken together, are a snapshot of where we're going as a company. We're shutting underperforming assets with the sale of our U.K. retail business. We're building out our strength in mid-market contract with the acquisition of Capital Office Products, one of the largest independent office product dealers in the U.S. And we're providing our mid-market customers with an expanded offering of services through our partnership with Managed by Q. 
Turning now to Slide 4. As I officially step into the role of CEO, let me walk you through why I believe we have the right plan in place to transform Staples and get our company back to sustainable sales and earnings growth and why I'm so pleased with our progress to date. We're executing our plan from a position of strength. We're building scale and credibility in categories beyond office supplies. We have a world-class supply chain. Our cash flow and liquidity are strong. We have a diverse team of talented associates. At the same time, we also understand the magnitude of the headwinds we face from secular pressure in our core categories and ongoing channel shift. 
And so Staples 20/20 is a transformational change of our strategy, of our mindset and of our operating model that is designed to leverage our strength and address our challenges head on. We're driving extreme focus by allocating more resources to the businesses where we have our strongest competitive advantages and deemphasizing our underperforming businesses. We're increasing ownership and accountability across the organization. We're moving with greater speed, and we're prioritizing innovation as a catalyst to further differentiate us. 
Now just to remind you, Staples 20/20 has 4 strategic priorities that are really driving the transformation: one, accelerate growth in North America mid-market; two, preserve profitability in our North American stores; three, aggressive actions to drive profit improvement and reduce costs across the company; and fourth, narrowing our geographic focus on North America. As I mentioned just a minute ago, we sold our U.K. retail business for nominal proceeds. And we continue to explore strategic alternatives for the rest of our business in Europe, and this process remain right on track. 
Turning to Slide 5. We pivoted from planning to execution of Staples 20/20 during the third quarter. Now our success with Staples 20/20 is all about alignment and execution, and there, we made some really tangible steps. 
Let's start with alignment. In September, we held our annual supplier summit, which brought together our merchandising leadership and vendor partners. Our vendors understand the critical role they play in our transformation and how they need to transform with us. 
In October, we held our U.S. retail leadership conference. At the conference, our store teams rally around its role in Staples 20/20, and they are confident that there is tremendous opportunity to stabilize the bottom line through better execution and selling. 
And earlier this month, we held our annual Staples Business Advantage leadership summit, where our SBA and staples.com teams aligned around accelerating growth in the mid-market via our unique combination of sales force and digital expertise. 
In addition to aligning around Staples 20/20, we're also extremely focused on the operational metrics that are the leading indicators of our transformation. So let me take a few minutes to discuss these metrics in more detail. 
Moving to Slide 6. We are positioning Staples Business Advantage as the growth engine of our company with the primary focus being mid-market. We define mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees. And as I mentioned, we have a differentiated approach to serving these customers where technology and innovation come together. This approach combines the personal touch of our sales force with digital selling tools, robust data on customer behavior and preferences and, of course, is backed by our robust website and supply chain. We estimate that the mid-market is an $80 billion opportunity in the U.S., and today, our market share is only 2%. We've been consistently growing our mid-market contract business in the low to mid-single digits this year, but our goal is to do much better. 
So as we accelerate mid-market, we're focused on 2 key metrics. The first one is membership customers. Our membership programs are the basis for building stronger relationships with our mid-market customers, and they drive a higher share of wallet and customer retention. At the end of the third quarter, we had more than 25,000 mid-market customers signed up, and our momentum is strong with 2/3 of our new customers we acquire signing up from the outset. Now historically, our lead generation was primarily driven by our sales force interacting with prospective customers. But today, we're widening the funnel by leveraging our digital capabilities to enhance the quality of our leads and accelerate customer adoption of our membership program. 
The second key metric for mid-market is sales beyond office supplies. These categories make up about 40% of our mid-market contract sales mix, and during Q3, we drove double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter with sales up 11% year-over-year. And we have aggressive plans to grow even faster in these categories. 
Now turning to Slide 7. What's also exciting for us is that is what's good for mid-market is often good for small and large businesses. Whether it's our broad business-focused assortment, a world-class supply chain, customized analytics, expertise, our mid-market strategy provides a halo effect to all of our business customer, whether they shop on staples.com, quill.com or through Staples Business Advantage. Today, half of our sales are in categories beyond office supplies, and we expect the mid-market halo to be a key driver of sustainable growth beyond office supplies for our business customers of all sizes. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our North American stores play a different role in our portfolio. Here, our top priority is to preserve profitability, and to achieve this, we're focused on 3 key metrics. First, customer conversion. Today, more than 1/3 of the customers who visit our retail stores walk out empty-handed. So we've dramatically increased our focus on this metric, and we're seeing good improvement. Customer conversion in U.S. stores increased 175 basis points in Q3. 
Second, services growth. We continue to drive positive same-store sales in our print and marketing business, which was up in the low single digits in stores during Q3. And over the past few months, we've done a terrific upgrade to our self-service equipment, and the customer response has been strong. And just as a reminder, gross margin in this category runs about twice the house. [ph] 
And third, store count. We've closed 345 stores or 18% of our chain since 2011. We closed 16 stores in Q3 and remain on track to close at least 50 stores this year. If a store does not meet our financial requirement, we will not keep it open. Our average remaining lease life per store in the U.S. is now less than 3 years, and in Canada, it's about 4 years. And over the next 3 years, an average of 225 store leases will expire annually. So all of this provides tremendous flexibility to continue rightsizing our store network. 
Turning to Slide 9. We're prioritizing innovation as a key catalyst to further differentiate Staples from the competition. There's so much going on at Staples, but let me just give you a few examples. 
Today, we announced a strategic partnership with Managed by Q, and that's a great example of using innovation to bring a differentiated service offering to our growing base of mid-market customers. Managed by Q is the smart office cleaning, management and maintenance platform created to save businesses' and employees' valuable time, allowing them to focus their energy and resources on their work, not their workspace. We're going to be offering our mid-market customers access to Managed by Q suite of more than 100 different office services, from cleaners to handyman to IT support and even workplace yoga. 
Our co-working offering with Workbar is another example of innovation. This time to drive customer traffic and utilize excess space in our retail store. During the third quarter, we opened collaborative working spaces in 3 of our stores in the Boston area, including store #1 in Brighton. Each location provides small companies and entrepreneurs with the creative space, office essentials, nourishment and support to run their business or launch new ideas. These locations are beautiful. I encourage you to check them out. 
Staples Easy System is an example of applying technology to drive innovation for a truly easy customer experience. Our new voice-enabled Easy Button reordering system integrates IBM Watson's cognitive platform to simplify office product management for our SBA customers. The Easy Button will enable customers to quickly reorder supplies, track shipments or chat about their needs. It's the assistant's assistant. We were the only retailer to keynote at the recent World of Watson conference. We began alpha testing of the Easy system during Q3 with a handful of our contract customers, and we plan to do a broader beta test to more than 100 customers by year-end. 
Turning to Slide 10. When we launched Staples 20/20, we initiated a new cost-savings plan, which is expected to generate $300 million of annualized pretax savings by 2018. These savings will help us fund some of our key investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market. We made good progress here during the third quarter. We reduced product costs, evolved our promotional strategies, drove efficiencies in supply chain and increased our mix of Staples brand products. We remain on track to achieve approximately $70 million of annualized pretax cost savings during 2016. 
Moving to Slide 11. This pulls it together. As we execute Staples 20/20, we will become a radically different company with fundamentally improved growth prospects. More than 60% of our sales will come from categories beyond office supplies. More than 80% of our sales will be delivered, and more than 95% of our sales will come from North America. 
Now let's take a quick look at Q3 results for each of our business units. Starting with North America Commercial on Slide 12. Sales were up 1% per year year-over-year, excluding the sale of Staples Print Solutions. On a GAAP basis, sales in North America Commercial declined 3% versus Q3 of last year to $2.1 billion. In Staples Business Advantage, Q3 sales grew 2% after excluding the headwind from the Staples Print Solutions sale. We once again drove growth in all of our categories beyond office supplies. Sales were up in the double digits in facilities and breakroom supplies, mid-single digits in technology products and low single digits in furniture and promotional products. Staples Business Advantage sales in core categories, like ink and toner, were down in the mid-single digit, and sales of paper and office supplies, once again, declined in the low single digits. 
During Q3, North American Commercial operating income rate increased 18 basis points to 8.1%. Operating income declined by $1 million or less than 1% compared to last year, but this includes a $5 million headwind related to the sale of Staples Print Solutions. The improvement in operating income rate primarily reflects lower compensation expense, partially offset by increased supply chain costs and lower product margin rate. 
Turning to North America Stores and Online on Slide 13. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% to $2.5 billion versus Q3 of last year. During Q3, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 3%. This reflects a 1% decline in staples.com and a 4% decline in same-store sales, primarily driven by lower traffic. Results in Canada were stronger than in the U.S., and results during the back-to-school season were in line with our overall Q3 performance. From a category perspective, the 3% decline in comparable sales during Q3 was almost entirely driven by weakness in ink and toner, business machines and mobility. These headwinds were somewhat offset by growth in computers and facilities supplies. 
North America Stores and Online operating income rate increased 7 basis points to 7.8% during the third quarter. This primarily reflects improved product margin rate in stores and online, partially offset by the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. 
And finally, turning to International Operations on Slide 14. Sales decreased 5%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 7% year-over-year to $749 million. In Europe, sales were down in the low double digits in local currency. Outside of Europe, our strongest results were in China again, where the sales were up in strong double digits year-over-year. On the bottom line, operating income rate for International Operations increased 76 basis points to 0.7%. This primarily reflects improved profitability in Europe. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our Q3 financial results and outlook in more detail."
34740,408144373,1088453,"Staples, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Shira. Let me start on Slide 15 with some additional color on our Q3 financial results. Total company sales for the third quarter were $5.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q3 of last year. T",916,"Great. Thank you, Shira. Let me start on Slide 15 with some additional color on our Q3 financial results. Total company sales for the third quarter were $5.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q3 of last year. These exclude headwinds of about 150 basis points from the sale of Staples Print Solutions, 60 basis points from store closures and 30 basis points from the stronger U.S. dollar. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% versus Q3 of last year. 
During Q3, non-GAAP gross profit dollars decreased $81 million versus Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross profit rate for the third quarter decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 26.9%. This decline primarily reflects increased supply chain costs and unfavorable impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. On a GAAP basis, gross profit rate decreased 28 basis points to 26.9% versus last year. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. During Q3, total company SG&A decreased $74 million year-over-year after excluding $5 million of charges this year, primarily related to exploring strategic alternatives in Europe, as well as $15 million of charges, primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot during Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A rate declined 48 basis points year-over-year to 20.1%. This primarily reflects lower compensation expense and lower marketing expense. On a GAAP basis, SG&A rate decreased 65 basis points to 20.1% versus Q3 of last year. 
Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating income declined $3 million year-over-year to $355 million and non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 22 basis points year-over-year to 6.6%. 
Turning to our Q3 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
During the third quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.34, a decline of $0.01 versus Q3 of last year primarily due to the higher tax rate and share count year-over-year. Our Q3 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $57 million, primarily related to impairment of intangible assets in International Operations. On a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.27. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 16. Year-to-date, capital expenditures came in at $158 million, which is a decrease of $57 million or 27% versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $630 million, our year-to-date cash flow was $472 million as of the end of the quarter. Keep in mind that the $250 million breakup fee we paid to Office Depot and cash payments of about $90 million related to the Office Depot acquisition financing are included as year-to-date operating cash outflows. These payments are deductible -- tax deductible, and we expect to realize the majority of the associated tax benefit by the end of 2016. 
Our liquidity remains very strong at $2.2 billion at the end of Q3. This includes cash and cash equivalents of about $1.1 billion as well as available lines of credit of about $1.1 billion. At the end of Q3, $636 million of our cash was held outside of the United States. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We currently returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually through our cash dividend. We are also balancing cash deployment through share repurchases with our solid pipeline of attractive tuck-in acquisition opportunities. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter. And in early Q4, we completed the acquisition of Capital Office Products, an independent office product dealer that generates more than $100 million of annual revenue. This acquisition strengthens our competitive position in the all-important mid-market, and we will soon provide Capital's customers access to our world-class e-commerce solutions, expansive assortments and expertise in categories beyond office supplies. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 17. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decline versus Q4 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our contract business in North America. This will be offset by headwinds related to the divestiture of noncore businesses as well as ongoing weaknesses in Europe, continued ink and toner and technology headwinds in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect fourth quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.23 to $0.26. This reflects continued progress on our cost-saving initiatives, offset by increased investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to the company's strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives as well as the ongoing strategic alternatives for the company's European operations. 
Our [ph] team continues to do a nice job managing working capital and reducing capital spend. As a result, we have increased our free cash flow guidance for 2016. We now expect to generate approximately $700 million of free cash flow this year versus our previous guidance of approximately $600 million. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the after tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with the financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. 
I'll now turn it back over to Karen, our conference call moderator, for Q&A."

That is really a insight driven by Steve Matyas, our new Head of North American Retail. And when he came with a fresh set of eyes and looked at how we were spending our hours in the stores, we were spending probably too many hours on a lot of the operating tasks that were flowing down from the home office. And so we have very aggressively reduced some of the operating tasks that are lower value and reshuffled that time into sales-driving activities. That is really the prime driver. At the same time, it's augmented, obviously, with the promotions, the programs, the training to really drive the selling culture. But I was personally down at the retail conference, as I said, last month, and that team is on fire to use the hours they have to drive conversion and really rebuild a selling culture in the stores."

This morning, we announced third quarter results that were right in line with our expectations. Starting on Slide 3, let's take a quick look at the headline.

This morning, we announced third quarter results that were right in line with our expectations. 
Starting on Slide 3, let's take a quick look at the headline. Total company sales were down 2% excluding the impact of store closures, changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of Staples Print Solutions during Q2 of this year. We continue to drive steady growth in Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, with Q3 sales up 2% in local currency after excluding the headwind from Staples Print Solutions. This was led by growth in our mid-market and had a growth beyond office supply. 
Non-GAAP operating income rate, it improved 22 basis points, and we drove improved operating income rate across all of our business units versus last year. We achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 versus $0.35 during Q3 of last year. We ended Q3 with $2.2 billion of liquidity, including $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We've increased our full year free cash flow guidance from $600 million to $700 million. Our Board of Directors concluded their CEO search process and appointed me as Staples' Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. 
And in Q4, we've already been busy. We completed 3 transactions that, taken together, are a snapshot of where we're going as a company. We're shutting underperforming assets with the sale of our U.K. retail business. We're building out our strength in mid-market contract with the acquisition of Capital Office Products, one of the largest independent office product dealers in the U.S. And we're providing our mid-market customers with an expanded offering of services through our partnership with Managed by Q. 
Turning now to Slide 4. As I officially step into the role of CEO, let me walk you through why I believe we have the right plan in place to transform Staples and get our company back to sustainable sales and earnings growth and why I'm so pleased with our progress to date. We're executing our plan from a position of strength. We're building scale and credibility in categories beyond office supplies. We have a world-class supply chain. Our cash flow and liquidity are strong. We have a diverse team of talented associates. At the same time, we also understand the magnitude of the headwinds we face from secular pressure in our core categories and ongoing channel shift. 
And so Staples 20/20 is a transformational change of our strategy, of our mindset and of our operating model that is designed to leverage our strength and address our challenges head on. We're driving extreme focus by allocating more resources to the businesses where we have our strongest competitive advantages and deemphasizing our underperforming businesses. We're increasing ownership and accountability across the organization. We're moving with greater speed, and we're prioritizing innovation as a catalyst to further differentiate us. 
Now just to remind you, Staples 20/20 has 4 strategic priorities that are really driving the transformation: one, accelerate growth in North America mid-market; two, preserve profitability in our North American stores; three, aggressive actions to drive profit improvement and reduce costs across the company; and fourth, narrowing our geographic focus on North America. As I mentioned just a minute ago, we sold our U.K. retail business for nominal proceeds. And we continue to explore strategic alternatives for the rest of our business in Europe, and this process remain right on track. 
Turning to Slide 5. We pivoted from planning to execution of Staples 20/20 during the third quarter. Now our success with Staples 20/20 is all about alignment and execution, and there, we made some really tangible steps. 
Let's start with alignment. In September, we held our annual supplier summit, which brought together our merchandising leadership and vendor partners. Our vendors understand the critical role they play in our transformation and how they need to transform with us. 
In October, we held our U.S. retail leadership conference. At the conference, our store teams rally around its role in Staples 20/20, and they are confident that there is tremendous opportunity to stabilize the bottom line through better execution and selling. 
And earlier this month, we held our annual Staples Business Advantage leadership summit, where our SBA and staples.com teams aligned around accelerating growth in the mid-market via our unique combination of sales force and digital expertise. 
In addition to aligning around Staples 20/20, we're also extremely focused on the operational metrics that are the leading indicators of our transformation. So let me take a few minutes to discuss these metrics in more detail. 
Moving to Slide 6. We are positioning Staples Business Advantage as the growth engine of our company with the primary focus being mid-market. We define mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees. And as I mentioned, we have a differentiated approach to serving these customers where technology and innovation come together. This approach combines the personal touch of our sales force with digital selling tools, robust data on customer behavior and preferences and, of course, is backed by our robust website and supply chain. We estimate that the mid-market is an $80 billion opportunity in the U.S., and today, our market share is only 2%. We've been consistently growing our mid-market contract business in the low to mid-single digits this year, but our goal is to do much better. 
So as we accelerate mid-market, we're focused on 2 key metrics. The first one is membership customers. Our membership programs are the basis for building stronger relationships with our mid-market customers, and they drive a higher share of wallet and customer retention. At the end of the third quarter, we had more than 25,000 mid-market customers signed up, and our momentum is strong with 2/3 of our new customers we acquire signing up from the outset. Now historically, our lead generation was primarily driven by our sales force interacting with prospective customers. But today, we're widening the funnel by leveraging our digital capabilities to enhance the quality of our leads and accelerate customer adoption of our membership program. 
The second key metric for mid-market is sales beyond office supplies. These categories make up about 40% of our mid-market contract sales mix, and during Q3, we drove double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter with sales up 11% year-over-year. And we have aggressive plans to grow even faster in these categories. 
Now turning to Slide 7. What's also exciting for us is that is what's good for mid-market is often good for small and large businesses. Whether it's our broad business-focused assortment, a world-class supply chain, customized analytics, expertise, our mid-market strategy provides a halo effect to all of our business customer, whether they shop on staples.com, quill.com or through Staples Business Advantage. Today, half of our sales are in categories beyond office supplies, and we expect the mid-market halo to be a key driver of sustainable growth beyond office supplies for our business customers of all sizes. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our North American stores play a different role in our portfolio. Here, our top priority is to preserve profitability, and to achieve this, we're focused on 3 key metrics. First, customer conversion. Today, more than 1/3 of the customers who visit our retail stores walk out empty-handed. So we've dramatically increased our focus on this metric, and we're seeing good improvement. Customer conversion in U.S. stores increased 175 basis points in Q3. 
Second, services growth. We continue to drive positive same-store sales in our print and marketing business, which was up in the low single digits in stores during Q3. And over the past few months, we've done a terrific upgrade to our self-service equipment, and the customer response has been strong. And just as a reminder, gross margin in this category runs about twice the house. 
And third, store count. We've closed 345 stores or 18% of our chain since 2011. We closed 16 stores in Q3 and remain on track to close at least 50 stores this year. If a store does not meet our financial requirement, we will not keep it open. Our average remaining lease life per store in the U.S. is now less than 3 years, and in Canada, it's about 4 years. And over the next 3 years, an average of 225 store leases will expire annually. So all of this provides tremendous flexibility to continue rightsizing our store network. 
Turning to Slide 9. We're prioritizing innovation as a key catalyst to further differentiate Staples from the competition. There's so much going on at Staples, but let me just give you a few examples. 
Today, we announced a strategic partnership with Managed by Q, and that's a great example of using innovation to bring a differentiated service offering to our growing base of mid-market customers. Managed by Q is the smart office cleaning, management and maintenance platform created to save businesses' and employees' valuable time, allowing them to focus their energy and resources on their work, not their workspace. We're going to be offering our mid-market customers access to Managed by Q suite of more than 100 different office services, from cleaners to handyman to IT support and even workplace yoga. 
Our co-working offering with Workbar is another example of innovation. This time to drive customer traffic and utilize excess space in our retail store. During the third quarter, we opened collaborative working spaces in 3 of our stores in the Boston area, including store #1 in Brighton. Each location provides small companies and entrepreneurs with the creative space, office essentials, nourishment and support to run their business or launch new ideas. These locations are beautiful. I encourage you to check them out. 
Staples Easy System is an example of applying technology to drive innovation for a truly easy customer experience. Our new voice-enabled Easy Button reordering system integrates IBM Watson's cognitive platform to simplify office product management for our SBA customers. The Easy Button will enable customers to quickly reorder supplies, track shipments or chat about their needs. It's the assistant's assistant. We were the only retailer to keynote at the recent World of Watson conference. We began alpha testing of the Easy system during Q3 with a handful of our contract customers, and we plan to do a broader beta test to more than 100 customers by year-end. 
Turning to Slide 10. When we launched Staples 20/20, we initiated a new cost-savings plan, which is expected to generate $300 million of annualized pretax savings by 2018. These savings will help us fund some of our key investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market. We made good progress here during the third quarter. We reduced product costs, evolved our promotional strategies, drove efficiencies in supply chain and increased our mix of Staples brand products. We remain on track to achieve approximately $70 million of annualized pretax cost savings during 2016. 
Moving to Slide 11. This pulls it together. As we execute Staples 20/20, we will become a radically different company with fundamentally improved growth prospects. More than 60% of our sales will come from categories beyond office supplies. More than 80% of our sales will be delivered, and more than 95% of our sales will come from North America. 
Now let's take a quick look at Q3 results for each of our business units. Starting with North America Commercial on Slide 12. Sales were up 1% per year year-over-year, excluding the sale of Staples Print Solutions. On a GAAP basis, sales in North America Commercial declined 3% versus Q3 of last year to $2.1 billion. In Staples Business Advantage, Q3 sales grew 2% after excluding the headwind from the Staples Print Solutions sale. We once again drove growth in all of our categories beyond office supplies. Sales were up in the double digits in facilities and breakroom supplies, mid-single digits in technology products and low single digits in furniture and promotional products. Staples Business Advantage sales in core categories, like ink and toner, were down in the mid-single digit, and sales of paper and office supplies, once again, declined in the low single digits. 
During Q3, North American Commercial operating income rate increased 18 basis points to 8.1%. Operating income declined by $1 million or less than 1% compared to last year, but this includes a $5 million headwind related to the sale of Staples Print Solutions. The improvement in operating income rate primarily reflects lower compensation expense, partially offset by increased supply chain costs and lower product margin rate. 
Turning to North America Stores and Online on Slide 13. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% to $2.5 billion versus Q3 of last year. During Q3, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 3%. This reflects a 1% decline in staples.com and a 4% decline in same-store sales, primarily driven by lower traffic. Results in Canada were stronger than in the U.S., and results during the back-to-school season were in line with our overall Q3 performance. From a category perspective, the 3% decline in comparable sales during Q3 was almost entirely driven by weakness in ink and toner, business machines and mobility. These headwinds were somewhat offset by growth in computers and facilities supplies. 
North America Stores and Online operating income rate increased 7 basis points to 7.8% during the third quarter. This primarily reflects improved product margin rate in stores and online, partially offset by the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. 
And finally, turning to International Operations on Slide 14. Sales decreased 5%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 7% year-over-year to $749 million. In Europe, sales were down in the low double digits in local currency. Outside of Europe, our strongest results were in China again, where the sales were up in strong double digits year-over-year. On the bottom line, operating income rate for International Operations increased 76 basis points to 0.7%. This primarily reflects improved profitability in Europe. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our Q3 financial results and outlook in more detail."
34740,408144373,1088561,"Staples, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Shira. Let me start on Slide 15 with some additional color on our Q3 financial results. Total company sales for the third quarter were $5.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q3 of last year. T",915,"Great. Thank you, Shira. Let me start on Slide 15 with some additional color on our Q3 financial results. Total company sales for the third quarter were $5.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q3 of last year. These exclude headwinds of about 150 basis points from the sale of Staples Print Solutions, 60 basis points from store closures and 30 basis points from the stronger U.S. dollar. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% versus Q3 of last year. 
During Q3, non-GAAP gross profit dollars decreased $81 million versus Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross profit rate for the third quarter decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 26.9%. This decline primarily reflects increased supply chain costs and unfavorable impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. On a GAAP basis, gross profit rate decreased 28 basis points to 26.9% versus last year. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. During Q3, total company SG&A decreased $74 million year-over-year after excluding $5 million of charges this year, primarily related to exploring strategic alternatives in Europe, as well as $15 million of charges, primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot during Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A rate declined 48 basis points year-over-year to 20.1%. This primarily reflects lower compensation expense and lower marketing expense. On a GAAP basis, SG&A rate decreased 65 basis points to 20.1% versus Q3 of last year. 
Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating income declined $3 million year-over-year to $355 million and non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 22 basis points year-over-year to 6.6%. 
Turning to our Q3 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
During the third quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.34, a decline of $0.01 versus Q3 of last year primarily due to the higher tax rate and share count year-over-year. Our Q3 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of $57 million, primarily related to impairment of intangible assets in International Operations. On a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.27. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 16. Year-to-date, capital expenditures came in at $158 million, which is a decrease of $57 million or 27% versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $630 million, our year-to-date cash flow was $472 million as of the end of the quarter. Keep in mind that the $250 million breakup fee we paid to Office Depot and cash payments of about $90 million related to the Office Depot acquisition financing are included as year-to-date operating cash outflows. These payments are deductible -- tax deductible, and we expect to realize the majority of the associated tax benefit by the end of 2016. 
Our liquidity remains very strong at $2.2 billion at the end of Q3. This includes cash and cash equivalents of about $1.1 billion as well as available lines of credit of about $1.1 billion. At the end of Q3, $636 million of our cash was held outside of the United States. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We currently returned more than $300 million to shareholders annually through our cash dividend. We are also balancing cash deployment through share repurchases with our solid pipeline of attractive tuck-in acquisition opportunities. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter. And in early Q4, we completed the acquisition of Capital Office Products, an independent office product dealer that generates more than $100 million of annual revenue. This acquisition strengthens our competitive position in the all-important mid-market, and we will soon provide Capital's customers access to our world-class e-commerce solutions, expansive assortments and expertise in categories beyond office supplies. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 17. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decline versus Q4 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our contract business in North America. This will be offset by headwinds related to the divestiture of noncore businesses as well as ongoing weaknesses in Europe, continued ink and toner and technology headwinds in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect fourth quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.23 to $0.26. This reflects continued progress on our cost-saving initiatives, offset by increased investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to the company's strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives as well as the ongoing strategic alternatives for the company's European operations. 
Our team continues to do a nice job managing working capital and reducing capital spend. As a result, we have increased our free cash flow guidance for 2016. We now expect to generate approximately $700 million of free cash flow this year versus our previous guidance of approximately $600 million. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the after tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with the financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. 
I'll now turn it back over to Karen, our conference call moderator, for Q&A."

That is really a insight driven by Steve Matyas, our new Head of North American Retail. And when he came with a fresh set of eyes and looked at how we were spending our hours in the stores, we were spending probably too many hours on a lot of the operating tasks that were flowing down from the home office. And so we have very aggressively reduced some of the operating tasks that are lower value and reshuffled that time into sales-driving activities. That is really the prime driver. At the same time, it's augmented, obviously, with the promotions, the programs, the training to really drive the selling culture. But I was personally down at the retail conference, as I said, last month, and that team is on fire to use the hours they have to drive conversion and really rebuild a selling culture in the stores."

It is supply chain-related, I mean, just general efficiency throughout the organization. So as you can imagine, supply chain and COGS are more back-loaded. To date, we've achieved about 700 -- $70 million annualized savings, and as I said earlier in the call, we are going to use some of that to reinvest back into the business. Our target of reinvestment really varies quarter-by-quarter. And over the long term, we'll just continue to evolve it as the business evolves and the initiatives -- and the initiative opportunities arise, so no specific guidance on that. The other point that I would add is that if you think about these, as I said, a lot of these things are in gross margins, so COGS, the supply chain. So it's kind of gets sprinkled throughout the P&L as well. So you can't pinpoint any one dollar, any one quarter either."

Starting on Slide 3, let's take a quick look at the headlines. Total company sales were down 2% excluding the impact of store closures, changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of Staples Print Solutions during Q2 of this year. We continue to drive steady growth in Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, with Q3 sales up 2% in local currency after excluding the headwind from Staples Print Solutions. This was led by growth in our mid-market and categories beyond office supplies.
Non-GAAP operating income rate. It improved 22 basis points, and we drove improved operating income rate across all of our business units versus last year. We achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 versus $0.35 during Q3 of last year. We ended Q3 with $2.2 billion of liquidity, including $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We've increased our full year free cash flow guidance from $600 million to $700 million. Our Board of Directors concluded their CEO search process and appointed me as Staples' Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. 
And in Q4, we've already been busy. We completed 3 transactions that, taken together, are a snapshot of where we're going as a company. We're shedding underperforming assets with the sale of our U.K. retail business. We're building on our strength in mid-market contracts with the acquisition of Capital Office Products, one of the largest independent office product dealers in the U.S. And we're providing our mid-market customers with an expanded offering of services through our partnership with Managed by Q. 
Turning now to Slide 4. As I officially step into the role of CEO, let me walk you through why I believe we have the right plan in place to transform Staples and get our company back to sustainable sales and earnings growth and why I'm so pleased with our progress to date. We're executing our plan from a position of strength. We're building scale and credibility in categories beyond office supplies. We have a world-class supply chain. Our cash flow and liquidity are strong. We have a diverse team of talented associates. At the same time, we also understand the magnitude of the headwinds we face from secular pressure in our core categories and ongoing channel shift. 
And so Staples 20/20 is a transformational change of our strategy, of our mindset and of our operating model that is designed to leverage our strengths and address our challenges head on. We're driving extreme focus by allocating more resources to the businesses where we have our strongest competitive advantages and deemphasizing our underperforming businesses. We're increasing ownership and accountability across the organization. We're moving with greater speed, and we're prioritizing innovation as a catalyst to further differentiate us. 
Now just to remind you, Staples 20/20 has 4 strategic priorities that are really driving the transformation: one, accelerate growth in North America mid-market; two, preserve profitability in our North American stores; three, aggressive actions to drive profit improvement and reduce costs across the company; and fourth, narrowing our geographic focus on North America. As I mentioned just a minute ago, we sold our U.K. retail business for nominal proceeds. And we continue to explore strategic alternatives for the rest of our business in Europe, and this process remains right on track. 
Turning to Slide 5. We pivoted from planning to execution of Staples 20/20 during the third quarter. Now our success with Staples 20/20 is all about alignment and execution, and there, we made some really tangible steps. 
Let's start with alignment. In September, we held our annual supplier summit, which brought together our merchandising leadership and vendor partners. Our vendors understand the critical role they play in our transformation and how they need to transform with us. 
In October, we held our U.S. retail leadership conference. At the conference, our store teams rallied around its role in Staples 20/20, and they are confident that there is tremendous opportunity to stabilize the bottom line through better execution and selling. 
And earlier this month, we held our annual Staples Business Advantage leadership summit, where our SBA and staples.com teams aligned around accelerating growth in the mid-market via our unique combination of sales force and digital expertise. 
In addition to aligning around Staples 20/20, we're also extremely focused on the operational metrics that are the leading indicators of our transformation. So let me take a few minutes to discuss these metrics in more detail. 
Moving to Slide 6. We are positioning Staples Business Advantage as the growth engine of our company with the primary focus being mid-markets. We define mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees. And as I mentioned, we have a differentiated approach to serving these customers where technology and innovation come together. This approach combines the personal touch of our sales force with digital selling tools, robust data on customer behavior and preferences and, of course, is backed by our robust website and supply chain. We estimate that the mid-market is an $80 billion opportunity in the U.S., and today, our market share is only 2%. We've been consistently growing our mid-market contract business in the low to mid-single digits this year, but our goal is to do much better. 
So as we accelerate mid-market, we're focused on 2 key metrics. The first one is membership customers. Our membership programs are the basis for building stronger relationships with our mid-market customers, and they drive a higher share of wallet and customer retention. At the end of the third quarter, we had more than 25,000 mid-market customers signed up, and our momentum is strong with 2/3 of our new customers we acquire, signing up from the outset. Now historically, our lead generation was primarily driven by our sales force interacting with prospective customers. But today, we're widening the funnel by leveraging our digital capabilities to enhance the quality of our leads and accelerate customer adoption of our membership program. 
The second key metric for mid-market is sales beyond office supplies. These categories make up about 40% of our mid-market contract sales mix, and during Q3, we drove double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter with sales up 11% year-over-year. And we have aggressive plans to grow even faster in these categories. 
Now turning to Slide 7. What's also exciting for us is that is what's good for mid-market is often good for small and large businesses. Whether it's our broad business-focused assortment, a world-class supply chain, customized analytics, expertise, our mid-market strategy provides a halo effect to all of our business customers, whether they shop on staples.com, quill.com or through Staples Business Advantage. Today, half of our sales are in categories beyond office supplies, and we expect the mid-market halo to be a key driver of sustainable growth beyond office supplies for our business customers of all sizes. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our North American stores play a different role in our portfolio. Here, our top priority is to preserve profitability, and to achieve this, we're focused on three key metrics: First, customer conversion. Today, more than 1/3 of the customers who visit our retail stores walk out empty-handed. So we've dramatically increased our focus on this metric, and we're seeing good improvement. Customer conversion in U.S. stores increased 175 basis points in Q3. 
Second, services growth. We continue to drive positive same-store sales in our print and marketing business, which was up in the low single digits in stores during Q3. And over the past few months, we've done a terrific upgrade to our self-service equipment, and the customer response has been strong. And just as a reminder, gross margin in this category runs about twice the house. 
And third, store count. We've closed 345 stores or 18% of our chain since 2011. We closed 16 stores in Q3 and remain on track to close at least 50 stores this year. If a store does not meet our financial requirements, we will not keep it open. Our average remaining lease life per store in the U.S. is now less than 3 years, and in Canada, it's about 4 years. And over the next 3 years, an average of 225 store leases will expire annually. So all of this provides tremendous flexibility to continue rightsizing our store network. 
Turning to Slide 9. We're prioritizing innovation as a key catalyst to further differentiate Staples from the competition. There's so much going on at Staples, but let me just give you a few examples. 
Today, we announced a strategic partnership with Managed by Q, and that's a great example of using innovation to bring a differentiated service offering to our growing base of mid-market customers. Managed by Q is the smart office cleaning, management and maintenance platform created to save businesses' and employees' valuable time, allowing them to focus their energy and resources on their work, not their workspace. We're going to be offering our mid-market customers access to Managed by Q suites of more than 100 different office services, from cleaners to handyman to IT support and even workplace yoga. 
Our co-working offering with Workbar is another example of innovation. This time to drive customer traffic and utilize excess space in our retail store. During the third quarter, we opened collaborative working spaces in 3 of our stores in the Boston area, including store #1 in Brighton. Each location provides small companies and entrepreneurs with the creative space, office essentials, nourishment and support to run their business or launch new ideas. These locations are beautiful. I encourage you to check them out. 
Staples Easy System is an example of applying technology to drive innovation for a truly easy customer experience. Our new voice-enabled Easy Button reordering system integrates IBM Watson's cognitive platform to simplify office product management for our SBA customers. The Easy Button will enable customers to quickly reorder supplies, track shipments or chat about their needs. It's the assistant's assistant. We were the only retailer to keynote at the recent World of Watson conference. We began alpha testing of the Easy system during Q3 with a handful of our contract customers, and we plan to do a broader beta test to more than 100 customers by year-end. 
Turning to Slide 10. When we launched Staples 20/20, we initiated a new cost-savings plan, which is expected to generate $300 million of annualized pre-tax savings by 2018. These savings will help us fund some of our key investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market. We made good progress here during the third quarter. We reduced product costs, evolved our promotional strategies, drove efficiencies in supply chain and increased our mix of Staples brand products. We remain on track to achieve approximately $70 million of annualized pre-tax cost savings during 2016. 
Moving to Slide 11. This pulls it together. As we execute Staples 20/20, we will become a radically different company with fundamentally improved growth prospects. More than 60% of our sales will come from categories beyond office supplies. More than 80% of our sales will be delivered, and more than 95% of our sales will come from North America. 
Now let's take a quick look at Q3 results for each of our business units. Starting with North America Commercial on Slide 12. Sales were up 1% per year-over-year, excluding the sale of Staples Print Solutions. On a GAAP basis, sales in North America Commercial declined 3% versus Q3 of last year to $2.1 billion. In Staples Business Advantage, Q3 sales grew 2% after excluding the headwind from the Staples Print Solutions sale. We once again drove growth in all of our categories beyond office supplies. Sales were up in the double digits in facilities and breakroom supplies, mid-single digits in technology products and low single digits in furniture and promotional products. Staples Business Advantage sales in core categories, like ink and toner, were down in the mid-single digits, and sales of paper and office supplies, once again, declined in the low single digits. 
During Q3, North American Commercial operating income rate increased 18 basis points to 8.1%. Operating income declined by $1 million or less than 1% compared to last year, but this includes a $5 million headwind related to the sale of Staples Print Solutions. The improvement in operating income rate primarily reflects lower compensation expense, partially offset by increased supply chain costs and lower product margin rate. 
Turning to North America Stores and Online on Slide 13. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% to $2.5 billion versus Q3 of last year. During Q3, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 3%. This reflects a 1% decline in staples.com and a 4% decline in same-store sales, primarily driven by lower traffic. Results in Canada were stronger than in the U.S., and results during the back-to-school season were in line with our overall Q3 performance. From a category perspective, the 3% decline in comparable sales during Q3 was almost entirely driven by weakness in ink and toner, business machines and mobility. These headwinds were somewhat offset by growth in computers and facilities supplies. 
North America Stores and Online operating income rate increased 7 basis points to 7.8% during the third quarter. This primarily reflects improved product margin rate in stores and online, partially offset by the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. 
And finally, turning to International Operations on Slide 14. Sales decreased 5%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 7% year-over-year to $749 million. In Europe, sales were down in the low double digits in local currency. Outside of Europe, our strongest results were in China again, where the sales were up in strong double digits year-over-year. On the bottom line, operating income rate for International Operations increased 76 basis points to 0.7%. This primarily reflects improved profitability in Europe. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our Q3 financial results and outlook in more detail."

During Q3, non-GAAP gross profit dollars decreased $81 million versus Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross profit rate for the third quarter decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 26.9%. This decline primarily reflects increased supply chain costs and unfavorable impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. On a GAAP basis, gross profit rate decreased 28 basis points to 26.9% versus last year. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. During Q3, total company SG&A decreased $74 million year-over-year after excluding $5 million of charges this year, primarily related to exploring strategic alternatives in Europe, as well as $15 million of charges, primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot during Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A rate declined 48 basis points year-over-year to 20.1%. This primarily reflects lower compensation expense and lower marketing expense. On a GAAP basis, SG&A rate decreased 65 basis points to 20.1% versus Q3 of last year. 
Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating income declined $3 million year-over-year to $355 million and non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 22 basis points year-over-year to 6.6%. 
Turning to our Q3 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
During the third quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.34, a decline of $0.01 versus Q3 of last year primarily due to the higher tax rate and share count year-over-year. Our Q3 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pre-tax charges of $57 million, primarily related to impairment of intangible assets in International Operations. On a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.27. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 16. Year-to-date, capital expenditures came in at $158 million, which is a decrease of $57 million or 27% versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $630 million, our year-to-date cash flow was $472 million as of the end of the quarter. Keep in mind that the $250 million breakup fee we paid to Office Depot and cash payments of about $90 million related to the Office Depot acquisition financing are included as year-to-date operating cash outflows. These payments are deductible -- tax deductible, and we expect to realize the majority of the associated tax benefit by the end of 2016. 
Our liquidity remains very strong at $2.2 billion at the end of Q3. This includes cash and cash equivalents of about $1.1 billion as well as available lines of credit of about $1.1 billion. At the end of Q3, $636 million of our cash was held outside of the United States. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We currently return more than $300 million to shareholders annually through our cash dividend. We are also balancing cash deployment through share repurchases with our solid pipeline of attractive tuck-in acquisition opportunities. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter. And in early Q4, we completed the acquisition of Capital Office Products, an independent office products dealer that generates more than $100 million of annual revenue. This acquisition strengthens our competitive position in the all-important mid-market, and we will soon provide Capital's customers access to our world-class e-commerce solutions, expansive assortments and expertise in categories beyond office supplies. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 17. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decline versus Q4 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our contract business in North America. This will be offset by headwinds related to the divestiture of non-core businesses as well as ongoing weaknesses in Europe, continued ink and toner and technology headwinds in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect fourth quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.23 to $0.26. This reflects continued progress on our cost-saving initiatives, offset by increased investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to the company's strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives as well as the ongoing strategic alternatives for the company's European operations. 
Our team continues to do a nice job managing working capital and reducing capital spend. As a result, we have increased our free cash flow guidance for 2016. We now expect to generate approximately $700 million of free cash flow this year versus our previous guidance of approximately $600 million. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the after-tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with the financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. 
I'll now turn it back over to Karen, our conference call moderator, for Q&A."

That is really a insight driven by Steve Matyas, our new Head of North American Retail.

And so we have very aggressively reduced some of the operating tasks that are lower value and reshuffled that time into sales-driving activities. That is really the prime driver. At the same time, it's augmented, obviously, with the promotions, the programs, the training to really drive the selling culture. But I was personally down at the retail conference, as I said, last month, and that team is on fire to use the hours they have to drive conversion and really rebuild a selling culture in the stores."

Having said that, the acquisitions of independent dealers is another profitable way for us to grow this business. When we acquire those stationers, they are immediate operating synergies of -- cost of goods sold is a huge synergy, obviously, back office and as well as other operations. So there's immediate operating synergies. And as I think Matt pointed out earlier, there's also huge BOSS revenue upside. So that's a key part of our mid-market growth strategy as well. It's a one-two punch."

Starting on Slide 3, let's take a quick look at the headlines. Total company sales were down 2% excluding the impact of store closures, changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of Staples Print Solutions during Q2 of this year. We continue to drive steady growth in Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, with Q3 sales up 2% in local currency after excluding the headwind from Staples Print Solutions. This was led by growth in our mid-market and categories beyond office supplies.
Non-GAAP operating income rate. It improved 22 basis points, and we drove improved operating income rate across all of our business units versus last year. We achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 versus $0.35 during Q3 of last year. We ended Q3 with $2.2 billion of liquidity, including $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We've increased our full year free cash flow guidance from $600 million to $700 million. Our Board of Directors concluded their CEO search process and appointed me as Staples' Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board. 
And in Q4, we've already been busy. We completed 3 transactions that, taken together, are a snapshot of where we're going as a company. We're shedding underperforming assets with the sale of our U.K. retail business. We're building on our strength in mid-market contracts with the acquisition of Capital Office Products, one of the largest independent office product dealers in the U.S. And we're providing our mid-market customers with an expanded offering of services through our partnership with Managed by Q. 
Turning now to Slide 4. As I officially step into the role of CEO, let me walk you through why I believe we have the right plan in place to transform Staples and get our company back to sustainable sales and earnings growth and why I'm so pleased with our progress to date. We're executing our plan from a position of strength. We're building scale and credibility in categories beyond office supplies. We have a world-class supply chain. Our cash flow and liquidity are strong. We have a diverse team of talented associates. At the same time, we also understand the magnitude of the headwinds we face from secular pressure in our core categories and ongoing channel shift. 
And so Staples 20/20 is a transformational change of our strategy, of our mindset and of our operating model that is designed to leverage our strengths and address our challenges head on. We're driving extreme focus by allocating more resources to the businesses where we have our strongest competitive advantages and deemphasizing our underperforming businesses. We're increasing ownership and accountability across the organization. We're moving with greater speed, and we're prioritizing innovation as a catalyst to further differentiate us. 
Now just to remind you, Staples 20/20 has 4 strategic priorities that are really driving the transformation: one, accelerate growth in North America mid-market; two, preserve profitability in our North American stores; three, aggressive actions to drive profit improvement and reduce costs across the company; and fourth, narrowing our geographic focus on North America. As I mentioned just a minute ago, we sold our U.K. retail business for nominal proceeds. And we continue to explore strategic alternatives for the rest of our business in Europe, and this process remains right on track. 
Turning to Slide 5. We pivoted from planning to execution of Staples 20/20 during the third quarter. Now our success with Staples 20/20 is all about alignment and execution, and there, we made some really tangible steps. 
Let's start with alignment. In September, we held our annual supplier summit, which brought together our merchandising leadership and vendor partners. Our vendors understand the critical role they play in our transformation and how they need to transform with us. 
In October, we held our U.S. retail leadership conference. At the conference, our store teams rallied around its role in Staples 20/20, and they are confident that there is tremendous opportunity to stabilize the bottom line through better execution and selling. 
And earlier this month, we held our annual Staples Business Advantage leadership summit, where our SBA and staples.com teams aligned around accelerating growth in the mid-market via our unique combination of sales force and digital expertise. 
In addition to aligning around Staples 20/20, we're also extremely focused on the operational metrics that are the leading indicators of our transformation. So let me take a few minutes to discuss these metrics in more detail. 
Moving to Slide 6. We are positioning Staples Business Advantage as the growth engine of our company with the primary focus being mid-markets. We define mid-market as business customers with 10 to 200 employees. And as I mentioned, we have a differentiated approach to serving these customers where technology and innovation come together. This approach combines the personal touch of our sales force with digital selling tools, robust data on customer behavior and preferences and, of course, is backed by our robust website and supply chain. We estimate that the mid-market is an $80 billion opportunity in the U.S., and today, our market share is only 2%. We've been consistently growing our mid-market contract business in the low to mid-single digits this year, but our goal is to do much better. 
So as we accelerate mid-market, we're focused on 2 key metrics. The first one is membership customers. Our membership programs are the basis for building stronger relationships with our mid-market customers, and they drive a higher share of wallet and customer retention. At the end of the third quarter, we had more than 25,000 mid-market customers signed up, and our momentum is strong with 2/3 of our new customers we acquire, signing up from the outset. Now historically, our lead generation was primarily driven by our sales force interacting with prospective customers. But today, we're widening the funnel by leveraging our digital capabilities to enhance the quality of our leads and accelerate customer adoption of our membership program. 
The second key metric for mid-market is sales beyond office supplies. These categories make up about 40% of our mid-market contract sales mix, and during Q3, we drove double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter with sales up 11% year-over-year. And we have aggressive plans to grow even faster in these categories. 
Now turning to Slide 7. What's also exciting for us is that is what's good for mid-market is often good for small and large businesses. Whether it's our broad business-focused assortment, a world-class supply chain, customized analytics, expertise, our mid-market strategy provides a halo effect to all of our business customers, whether they shop on staples.com, quill.com or through Staples Business Advantage. Today, half of our sales are in categories beyond office supplies, and we expect the mid-market halo to be a key driver of sustainable growth beyond office supplies for our business customers of all sizes. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our North American stores play a different role in our portfolio. Here, our top priority is to preserve profitability, and to achieve this, we're focused on 3 key metrics: First, customer conversion. Today, more than 1/3 of the customers who visit our retail stores walk out empty-handed. So we've dramatically increased our focus on this metric, and we're seeing good improvement. Customer conversion in U.S. stores increased 175 basis points in Q3. 
Second, services growth. We continue to drive positive same-store sales in our print and marketing business, which was up in the low single digits in stores during Q3. And over the past few months, we've done a terrific upgrade to our self-service equipment, and the customer response has been strong. And just as a reminder, gross margin in this category runs about twice the house. 
And third, store count. We've closed 345 stores or 18% of our chain since 2011. We closed 16 stores in Q3 and remain on track to close at least 50 stores this year. If a store does not meet our financial requirements, we will not keep it open. Our average remaining lease life per store in the U.S. is now less than 3 years, and in Canada, it's about 4 years. And over the next 3 years, an average of 225 store leases will expire annually. So all of this provides tremendous flexibility to continue rightsizing our store network. 
Turning to Slide 9. We're prioritizing innovation as a key catalyst to further differentiate Staples from the competition. There's so much going on at Staples, but let me just give you a few examples. 
Today, we announced a strategic partnership with Managed by Q, and that's a great example of using innovation to bring a differentiated service offering to our growing base of mid-market customers. Managed by Q is the smart office cleaning, management and maintenance platform created to save businesses' and employees' valuable time, allowing them to focus their energy and resources on their work, not their workspace. We're going to be offering our mid-market customers access to Managed by Q suites of more than 100 different office services, from cleaners to handyman to IT support and even workplace yoga. 
Our co-working offering with Workbar is another example of innovation. This time to drive customer traffic and utilize excess space in our retail store. During the third quarter, we opened collaborative working spaces in 3 of our stores in the Boston area, including store #1 in Brighton. Each location provides small companies and entrepreneurs with the creative space, office essentials, nourishment and support to run their business or launch new ideas. These locations are beautiful. I encourage you to check them out. 
Staples Easy System is an example of applying technology to drive innovation for a truly easy customer experience. Our new voice-enabled Easy Button reordering system integrates IBM Watson's cognitive platform to simplify office product management for our SBA customers. The Easy Button will enable customers to quickly reorder supplies, track shipments or chat about their needs. It's the assistant's assistant. We were the only retailer to keynote at the recent World of Watson conference. We began alpha testing of the Easy system during Q3 with a handful of our contract customers, and we plan to do a broader beta test to more than 100 customers by year-end. 
Turning to Slide 10. When we launched Staples 20/20, we initiated a new cost-savings plan, which is expected to generate $300 million of annualized pre-tax savings by 2018. These savings will help us fund some of our key investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market. We made good progress here during the third quarter. We reduced product costs, evolved our promotional strategies, drove efficiencies in supply chain and increased our mix of Staples brand products. We remain on track to achieve approximately $70 million of annualized pre-tax cost savings during 2016. 
Moving to Slide 11. This pulls it together. As we execute Staples 20/20, we will become a radically different company with fundamentally improved growth prospects. More than 60% of our sales will come from categories beyond office supplies. More than 80% of our sales will be delivered, and more than 95% of our sales will come from North America. 
Now let's take a quick look at Q3 results for each of our business units. Starting with North America Commercial on Slide 12. Sales were up 1% per year-over-year, excluding the sale of Staples Print Solutions. On a GAAP basis, sales in North America Commercial declined 3% versus Q3 of last year to $2.1 billion. In Staples Business Advantage, Q3 sales grew 2% after excluding the headwind from the Staples Print Solutions sale. We once again drove growth in all of our categories beyond office supplies. Sales were up in the double digits in facilities and breakroom supplies, mid-single digits in technology products and low single digits in furniture and promotional products. Staples Business Advantage sales in core categories, like ink and toner, were down in the mid-single digits, and sales of paper and office supplies, once again, declined in the low single digits. 
During Q3, North American Commercial operating income rate increased 18 basis points to 8.1%. Operating income declined by $1 million or less than 1% compared to last year, but this includes a $5 million headwind related to the sale of Staples Print Solutions. The improvement in operating income rate primarily reflects lower compensation expense, partially offset by increased supply chain costs and lower product margin rate. 
Turning to North America Stores and Online on Slide 13. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% to $2.5 billion versus Q3 of last year. During Q3, combined North American Stores and Online comparable sales declined by 3%. This reflects a 1% decline in staples.com and a 4% decline in same-store sales, primarily driven by lower traffic. Results in Canada were stronger than in the U.S., and results during the back-to-school season were in line with our overall Q3 performance. From a category perspective, the 3% decline in comparable sales during Q3 was almost entirely driven by weakness in ink and toner, business machines and mobility. These headwinds were somewhat offset by growth in computers and facilities supplies. 
North America Stores and Online operating income rate increased 7 basis points to 7.8% during the third quarter. This primarily reflects improved product margin rate in stores and online, partially offset by the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. 
And finally, turning to International Operations on Slide 14. Sales decreased 5%, excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, sales in U.S. dollars were down 7% year-over-year to $749 million. In Europe, sales were down in the low double digits in local currency. Outside of Europe, our strongest results were in China again, where the sales were up in strong double digits year-over-year. On the bottom line, operating income rate for International Operations increased 76 basis points to 0.7%. This primarily reflects improved profitability in Europe. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our Q3 financial results and outlook in more detail."

On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q3 of last ye",915,"Great. Thank you, Shira. Let me start on Slide 15 with some additional color on our Q3 financial results. Total company sales for the third quarter were $5.4 billion [ph]. On a non-GAAP basis, total company sales declined less than 2% versus Q3 of last year. These exclude headwinds of about 150 basis points from the sale of Staples Print Solutions, 60 basis points from store closures and 30 basis points from the stronger U.S. dollar. On a GAAP basis, sales declined 4% versus Q3 of last year. 
During Q3, non-GAAP gross profit dollars decreased $81 million versus Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross profit rate for the third quarter decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 26.9%. This decline primarily reflects increased supply chain costs and unfavorable impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. On a GAAP basis, gross profit rate decreased 28 basis points to 26.9% versus last year. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses. During Q3, total company SG&A decreased $74 million year-over-year after excluding $5 million of charges this year, primarily related to exploring strategic alternatives in Europe, as well as $15 million of charges, primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Office Depot during Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A rate declined 48 basis points year-over-year to 20.1%. This primarily reflects lower compensation expense and lower marketing expense. On a GAAP basis, SG&A rate decreased 65 basis points to 20.1% versus Q3 of last year. 
Excluding the impact of charges, non-GAAP total company operating income declined $3 million year-over-year to $355 million and non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 22 basis points year-over-year to 6.6%. 
Turning to our Q3 tax rate. Excluding the impact of charges, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.5% versus our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by changes in our geographic mix of earnings versus 2015. 
During the third quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.34, a decline of $0.01 versus Q3 of last year primarily due to the higher tax rate and share count year-over-year. Our Q3 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pre-tax charges of $57 million, primarily related to impairment of intangible assets in International Operations. On a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.27. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 16. Year-to-date, capital expenditures came in at $158 million, which is a decrease of $57 million or 27% versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $630 million, our year-to-date cash flow was $472 million as of the end of the quarter. Keep in mind that the $250 million breakup fee we paid to Office Depot and cash payments of about $90 million related to the Office Depot acquisition financing are included as year-to-date operating cash outflows. These payments are deductible -- tax deductible, and we expect to realize the majority of the associated tax benefit by the end of 2016. 
Our liquidity remains very strong at $2.2 billion at the end of Q3. This includes cash and cash equivalents of about $1.1 billion as well as available lines of credit of about $1.1 billion. At the end of Q3, $636 million of our cash was held outside of the United States. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We currently return more than $300 million to shareholders annually through our cash dividend. We are also balancing cash deployment through share repurchases with our solid pipeline of attractive tuck-in acquisition opportunities. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter. And in early Q4, we completed the acquisition of Capital Office Products, an independent office products dealer that generates more than $100 million of annual revenue. This acquisition strengthens our competitive position in the all-important mid-market, and we will soon provide Capital's customers access to our world-class e-commerce solutions, expansive assortments and expertise in categories beyond office supplies. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 17. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect total company sales to decline versus Q4 of last year. We expect to drive growth in categories beyond office supplies and in our contract business in North America. This will be offset by headwinds related to the divestiture of non-core businesses as well as ongoing weaknesses in Europe, continued ink and toner and technology headwinds in our retail stores and store closures. 
On the bottom line, we expect fourth quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.23 to $0.26. This reflects continued progress on our cost-saving initiatives, offset by increased investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to the company's strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives as well as the ongoing strategic alternatives for the company's European operations. 
Our team continues to do a nice job managing working capital and reducing capital spend. As a result, we have increased our free cash flow guidance for 2016. We now expect to generate approximately $700 million of free cash flow this year versus our previous guidance of approximately $600 million. Our free cash flow guidance excludes the after-tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with the financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement. 
I'll now turn it back over to Karen, our conference call moderator, for Q&A."

That is really a insight driven by Steve Matyas, our new Head of North American Retail. And when he came with a fresh set of eyes and looked at how we were spending our hours in the stores, we were spending probably too many hours on a lot of the operating tasks that were flowing down from the home office. And so we have very aggressively reduced some of the operating tasks that are lower value and reshuffled that time into sales-driving activities. That is really the prime driver. At the same time, it's augmented, obviously, with the promotions, the programs, the training to really drive the selling culture. But I was personally down at the retail conference, as I said, last month, and that team is on fire to use the hours they have to drive conversion and really rebuild a selling culture in the stores."

The first thing is, obviously, to remind everyone that we have a very mature staples.com business. It's nothing new for us. We've been doing it since the early 1990s, so lot of our retail customers already use our Online business. And you were 100% right when you said this was really about the mix of promotions. This quarter, we did a better balancing of sales and profitability, and in fact, our profitability was up nicely in staples.com. But we walked away from some profit-losing transactions, particularly in areas like tablets and printers. If we were to exclude that, actually, sales would be up slightly."

When we acquire those stationers, they are immediate operating synergies of -- cost of goods sold is a huge synergy, obviously, back office and as well as other operations. So there's immediate operating synergies. And as I think Matt pointed out earlier, there's also huge BOSS revenue upside. So that's a key part of our mid-market growth strategy as well. It's a one-two punch."

It is supply chain-related, I mean, just general efficiency throughout the organization. So as you can imagine, supply chain and COGS are more back-loaded. To date, we've achieved about 700 -- $70 million annualized savings, and as I said earlier in the call, we are going to use some of that to reinvest back into the business. Our target of reinvestment really varies quarter-by-quarter. And over the long term, we'll just continue to evolve it as the business evolves and the initiatives -- and the initiative opportunities arise, so no specific guidance on that. The other point that I would add is that if you think about these, as I said, a lot of these things are in gross margins, so COGS, the supply chain, so it kind of gets sprinkled throughout the P&L as well, so you can't pinpoint any one dollar, any one quarter either."
