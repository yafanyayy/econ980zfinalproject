Thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

Thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab in our website. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide some brief highlights from our financial results, then Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on our strategy; before Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, provides a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 as well as our full year outlook for 2016. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance, technology and industry trends, anticipated closings of acquisitions and their anticipated contribution to our financial results and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and in our other SEC filings. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
As we disclosed in our press release this morning, as the size of our international segment as a proportion of our total business continues to grow, especially in light of our pending acquisition in India, we have decided to change our reportable segments. As a result, we now operate in 5 segments. 5 segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and Services. Additionally, we have simplified our definition of full year organic core growth to be the average of the quarterly organic core growth rate in the year. This includes no change to the calculation methodology for the quarterly organic core growth metric. 
And now returning to our financial results. During the quarter, our property revenue grew over 21% to $1.25 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew over 21% to approximately $802 million. Our adjusted funds from operations increased by nearly 23% to approximately $542 million, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by nearly 22% to $206 million or $0.49 per basic and $0.48 per diluted common share. 
From a full year perspective, our property revenue grew by nearly 17% to $4.68 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by over 15% to nearly $3.07 billion, and adjusted funds from operations increased 18.5% to approximately $2.15 billion. Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by $206 million from the prior year. The primary drivers of the year-over-year decline in net income were the onetime $93 million cash tax charge as part of our previously announced GTP REIT tax election, the $74 million loss as a result of our retirement of our 7% senior notes and approximately $71 million in negative FX impact from the remeasurement of our intercompany notes. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

American Tower's 2015 results reconfirmed, yet again, the fundamental strength of the tower business model, the value of our portfolio diversification strategy across geographies, our focus on partnering with the leading mobile network operator tenants in the U.S. and around the world and our disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Before introducing Tom, who will provide the details of our 2015 performance and 2016 outlook, I'll begin with a very brief update on the company's overall strategic direction, which should then leave plenty of time for your questions following Tom's remarks. 
For many years now, we consistently and relentlessly focused on advancing American Tower's leadership in communications real estate, and we believe that the resulting long-term performance of the business tells a compelling story. We've been able to drive double-digit core growth in property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share for 6 consecutive years now while at the same time growing our common stock dividend at well over 20% annually since introducing it in 2012. 
We anticipate continuing to build on this track record, which remains based on our company's long-standing 3 strategic pillars. In 2015, we achieved a number of accomplishments to position the company for future success in each of the 3 pillars. Our first strategic pillar is building the asset scale to exceed our return on investment goals in select major markets. In this, we made tremendous progress in 2015. In our home U.S. market, American Tower secured the exclusive right to lease or acquire nearly 11,500 sites from Verizon Communications. We also acquired over 4,700 sites from Airtel in Nigeria and nearly 5,500 sites from Telecom Italia in Brazil. We also built over 3,000 towers and vast networks across our markets. And in India, the largest free market democracy in Asia, we assigned a transformational deal with Tata and its current partners and Viom, which will take our tower count there from 15,000 to over 57,000. This transaction is strategic for ATC, not simply because it increases our tower count, but because it enables us to build even deeper business relationships with high-quality, multinational mobile network operators such as Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, Tata, Reliance and Aircel, which will all be bringing the mobile Internet to India's 1.2 billion people. 
Our second strategic pillar is to focus on operational excellence to maximize the cash flow generated from each and every property. Among the most significant achievements in 2015 delivered by our operating units were containment of churn in our U.S. business due to skilled master lease contracting, the rapid effective integration of assets in the cases of Verizon and TIM transactions and efficient establishment of our new organization in Nigeria. This new market, staffed with both experienced ATC veterans and local professionals, delivered outstanding performance in new leasing business and in power and fuel management well in excess of its original business plan. And in India, our sales and operational teams generated the strongest tenant leasing growth we've seen in that market in a number of years. 
Our third and final strategic pillar is to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to have efficient and consistent access to the markets to support our capital allocation program. Given the company's long and consistent record of operational performance and financial discipline, American Tower was able to maintain its investment-grade rating and thereby efficiently and effectively access of broad and deep range of capital sources. In 2015, we executed capital markets transactions, which included refinancings and new issuances totaling $21 billion in order to fund our acquisition pipeline while at the same time reducing the average cost of our debt and increasing its average duration. 
In summary, and as many of you may recall, 3 years ago, I laid out an aspirational goal to again double the size and performance of the business by 2017. We've already more than doubled the number of assets we own or operate worldwide. And pro forma for the Viom transaction, we will be at over 140,000. At the same time, throughout this portfolio expansion, our investment evaluation discipline has enabled us to maintain a return on invested capital above 9% despite adding primarily lower initial tenancy and cash flow sites to the base. As a result, on a currency-neutral basis, our outlook for 2016 implies that we will have more than doubled our AFFO per share by 12/31, which should be a year ahead of schedule, which keeps us on a likely trajectory to achieve our aspirational objective on a reported basis by the end of the planning period in 2017. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a detailed review of our 2015 financial performance and our 2016 outlook."

The fourth quarter wrapped up another year of strong global organic core growth and revenue, accretive acquisitions and new tower and DAS builds for American Tower. As Jim does highlighted, we believe that our success in 2015 has positioned us well for not only 2016 but also for many years to come. But before we get into the details of our 2016 expectation, let's dive into our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. 
So if you please turn to Slide 6. We achieved strong growth in all of our key metrics in the fourth quarter. Our total property revenue core growth was nearly 26%, which included another solid quarter of organic core growth at over 7%. As expected, our U.S. organic core growth was about 5.2%, which excludes the positive impact of a onetime settlement of $7.8 million. On a run-rate basis, organic growth was about 6% in the U.S. for the quarter. Internationally, we generated organic core growth of over 12.5%. Consistent with our revenue growth, our adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was over 21% on a reported basis and over 26% on a core basis. Likewise, we converted the bulk of that adjusted EBITDA growth into AFFO with reported AFFO and AFFO per share growth of nearly 23% and over 15%, respectively. On a core basis, AFFO growth was about 30%. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Our strong fourth quarter propelled us to exceed the high end of our previously issued outlook for property revenue, resulting in reported growth of 17% or 23% on a core basis. This revenue out-performance was driven by double-digit organic growth internationally and another year of solid activity in the U.S. For the year, in our U.S. market, our organic core growth was near the middle of our 5-year average target range at about 6.6%, excluding the positive impact of the onetime $7.8 million settlement received in the quarter. Our international markets generated organic growth rates significantly in excess of that of the U.S., coming in at nearly 11% on a consolidated basis. Our Latin American markets generated organic core growth of over 10%, where network investments remain a top priority despite some macroeconomic challenges. In India, we generated organic core growth of around 10% for the full year as large incumbent Indian wireless operators ramp their spending to support the deployment of new technologies and spectrum. And in our fastest-growing region, EMEA, organic core growth was over 13%. 
Our strong finish to 2015 is a prime example of the strength of our diversified growth strategy, which leverages the benefits of operating in 13 different countries where our top dozen large multinational wireless customers are deploying a variety of different wireless technologies over different spectrum bands at different times. We believe that this diversification will support steady rates of growth for many years to come and complementing our organic growth with the impact of the 22,000 sites we added from Verizon, Airtel and TIM, which contributed about 11% to our core growth rate for the year. Activity on these sites is right where we expected it to be, and we are especially encouraged by the performance of our Nigerian assets, which are already significantly exceeding our expectations for new business demand and are poised for strong growth going forward. 
2015 was also a record year in terms of international new build activity with nearly 3,100 new towers completed by our global teams, which generated day 1 NOI yields of nearly 11%. In addition, we built more than 50 new DAS networks, largely indoor, globally in 2015, which generated day 1 NOI yields of over 12%. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Our solid revenue growth, coupled with tight cost controls, resulted in strong margin performance across our business. Our gross margin, excluding pass-through for the year, remained above 80% despite the addition of over 25,000 new sites with an average initial tenancy of just 1.4. This was a result of our strong organic gross margin conversion rate of about 97%. In fact, adjusting for the impact of our recent acquisitions, our gross margin would have expanded to almost 83%. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin was essentially flat year-over-year despite the impact of our acquisitions as we recognize the benefits of our global scale. And excluding the impact of acquisitions, we would have grown our adjusted EBITDA margin to 66.5%. Additionally, cash SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, declined over 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.6%, demonstrating a trend which we believe will continue. Our goal is to drive this metric below 8% into the future. 
Our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth in 2015 is detailed on Slide 9. Our teams delivered double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share for the sixth consecutive year despite the recent volatility in the currency markets. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 16% or nearly 23% on a core basis to approximately $3.1 billion. Reported AFFO grew by over 18% and 27% on a core basis, and AFFO per share grew by about 12% to $5.08 per share. This was driven by a strong adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio of over 80%. And like property revenue, both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share exceeded the high end of our previously issued outlook. 
Turning to Slide 10. Let's now take a look at our expectations for 2016. In 2016, at the midpoint of our outlook, we are projecting property revenue growth of about 20% on a reported basis and about 22% on a core basis. These numbers reflect our sizable new business pipeline coming into the year and our expectation that the positive demand trends underlying our 2015 organic growth will continue in 2016. For example, we expect international organic core growth and revenue to accelerate to just under 12%. As in 2015, we are poised to benefit from the diversification we have built in our asset base with the acceleration of site leasing activity in markets like Mexico and India being offset by some moderation in Brazil. Our 2016 international organic growth rate is also expected to benefit from rising escalators linked to the increasing local market inflation in many of our markets. Not only do these escalators help drive organic growth, but they also help offset foreign exchange translation effects over the long term. In the U.S., we expect organic core growth and revenue to be in the mid-5% range. As we have discussed previously, there are a few items impacting this rate in 2016. While aggregate new business commencements are expected to be up year-over-year, the pacing of new business commencement activity in 2016 is expected to be distributed more evenly throughout the year while it was more front-end-loaded in 2015, which had a negative impact on the growth rate, as you would expect. Second, we expect our decommissioning revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year, which also puts pressure on the growth rate but is largely offset by less churn forecasted in the U.S. for the year. So while the rate is down for the year, we're excited about the increased new business activity on our portfolio in the U.S. as we finish up the year. On a cash run-rate basis as of year-end 2016, which normalizes for the impact of timing differences and non-run-rate items, we expect growth to be approximately 6% in the U.S. Consequently, on a global consolidated basis, our overall organic core growth rate is expected to be about 7% for the year. 
The components of our property revenue expectations for 2016 are outlined on Slide 11. In addition to the 7% or so of organic core growth that I just spoke about, we expect our new assets to contribute an additional 15% of core property revenue growth. This includes our pending Viom transaction, which we expect to contribute about $595 million to revenue during the year, assuming a contribution of 9 months from the portfolio. New property revenue in 2016 also includes an incremental $265 million associated with the Verizon, TIM and Airtel assets we acquired in 2015, bringing the total incremental new asset growth in 2016 to about $860 million. About $280 million of this incremental $860 million in revenue is pass-through-related. Noncore items are forecasted to offset growth by about 6% and including expected step-down in straight line revenue of about $50 million and by foreign currency translation effects of around $180 million on our tenant revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 12. We expect to convert our strong revenue growth into another year of double-digit adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share growth. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow over 13% for the year or about 21% on a core basis at the midpoint. This reflects cash SG&A, as a percentage of total revenue, of just 8%, which is down over 0.5 percentage point from 2015 levels. While our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be down around 3.5% from 2015 levels, this is entirely attributable to the addition of new assets, which initially have lower tenancy and cash flow but are poised to drive strong growth for the business well into the future. Excluding the impact of our new assets, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin will be growing by about 2% at the midpoint to over 66%. Meanwhile, AFFO and AFFO per share growth are expected to be about 12% and over 10%, respectively, on a reported basis, and core AFFO is expected to grow approximately 18%. This includes strong contributions from our recently closed Verizon, TIM Brazil and Airtel Nigeria transactions as well as our pending Viom acquisition. At the midpoint of our outlook, 2016 would represent the ninth straight year of double-digit AFFO per share growth for American Tower. 
Turning to Page 13. We expect to maintain our disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive growth and improve yields across the business in 2016. Our first capital allocation priority continues to be our dividend, which has grown by an average of 26% since our REIT conversion just 5 years ago. In 2016, subject to the discretion of our board, we expect the dividend to continue to grow at least 20%. And as a result, we expect our payout ratio, as a percent of AFFO, to increase from current levels. Next, we expect to selectively deploy capital to build between 2,500 and 3,000 new sites, primarily in our international markets where we generated day 1 new build ROIs of nearly 11% in 2015. In addition, we expect to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities while at the same time maintaining our path towards achieving a 5x net leverage ratio by end of the year. We currently expect to be able to achieve our deleveraging goals by the fourth quarter, including the impact of funding our Viom acquisition with borrowings under our revolver and cash on hand. This is a result of strong growth in adjusted EBITDA as well as our continued repayment of debt throughout the year from our cash flow from operations. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Illustrating the effectiveness of our capital allocation strategy in driving growth, we have a long history of generating double-digit growth rates in all of our key financial metrics. As a result, in just 4 years, as you can see in the slide, we've nearly doubled our property revenue and adjusted EBITDA and more than doubled our AFFO while at the same time growing our REIT distribution 26%, on average, each year since its inception. The combination of share price appreciation resulting from the strong financial performance and the growth of our REIT distribution had delivered our shareholders a total return of over 100% since 2011. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our capital allocation has also driven significant improvements in NOI yields across the business. As you can see, our investments in lower initial tenancy sites are paying off with 300 to 600 basis points of yield improvement over a 4-year period. This type of NOI yield growth supports our ability to generate the cash flows we need to simultaneously fund our rapidly growing dividend as well as continue to invest in new growth assets. We expect to be able to drive similar NOI yield expansion on our recently acquired portfolios, which will further enhance our distribution potential for the long term. 
Moving on to Slide 16. And in closing, we generated strong operating results in 2015, highlighted by another year of double-digit AFFO per share growth while also significantly enhancing the company's long-term strategic position in several key markets through selective acquisitions and new site construction. Further, we meaningfully reduced our SG&A as a percentage of revenue while at the same time boosting our common stock dividend by nearly 30%. In 2016, we are focused on strategic priorities which support our vision of being a premier independent owner, operator and developer of communications real estate globally while driving similarly strong financial results. Operationally, we're focused on our daily execution, including driving strong growth across our existing asset base and leveraging the scale we built across our global business to drive margin improvement. Strategically, we're taking a significant step towards achieving greater scale in India with the pending Viom transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the first quarter, and the integration of that portfolio will be a significant focus for our management team. As a result of this transaction, we expect to end the year with over 145,000 sites globally with annualized revenues of just under $6 billion. Further, we remain on track to get back to 5x net leverage or below by year-end while maintaining our leading investment-grade balance sheet. This path contemplates the funding of our pending transactions as well as the capital spending outlook that we issued this morning. So taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to generate meaningful AFFO per share growth in combination with the materially growing dividend. As a result, we expect to deliver a compelling total return to our stockholders for many years to come. 
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

We see that actually growing to 10% over the next number of years, say, 4 to 5 years, but that still leaves 95% of the RAM spending in the U.S., in our view, remaining on the tower sites. Just -- it's the most effective and efficient way, again, we believe, to continue to build up the 4G network that everyone is going to need to do things like voice over IP, to do nice solid 4G video, but using much higher spectrum bands. Yes, the only way again tangibly and feasibly to do this in the field, we believe, and where 85% of people live in the United States, is still in the macro tower. So yes, there will be some increased spending, mainland in dense urban and urban, maybe 5% to 10% of the total RAM spending, but we still see plenty of upside for towers and long waves on the business here in the United States."

You're going to see those amendments continue, and we've got a real nice pipeline of those already. It does take a few weeks and months to get deployment schedules in place and equipment actually installed and billing, but the pipeline is really strong, as Tom said. On the other hand, as you go into these higher bands and you apply carrier aggregation and other approaches to adding those bands to your network, ultimately, you're going to need a more dense network, sites closer together because they -- as you go higher up in bands, you go shorter, effective radius. And if you're trying to create a consistent customer experience, and you want to use 700 and 1.9 and the handoff even in the same transmission side, you're going to have to design to that highest band. And therefore, sites ultimately have to be closer together over time. So again, we have a pipeline of new leases as well as amendments and those are [indiscernible] driven on the one hand by the densification that I just described. Also by some carriers also expanding their actual deployment footprint geographically, based on the benefits that they now see of a bigger customer base versus roaming. So there are a couple of factors that are supporting the new lease side of the equation as well as the amendment side."

So Mexico is a great environment for us. We're incredibly well strategically positioned to take advantage of it. And so as Tom said, it's going to be a positive contributor to us this year. Brazil is still strong, yet last year it was actually quite robust as far as new leasing. It's going to be robust in 2016, just not at the same level, but there are 4, again very competitive, well-funded mobile operators there. 3 of the 4 operators are multinational leaders. Those are Telefónica, América Móvil and Telecom Italia, of course. And [indiscernible] sort of the country incumbent, the local country incumbent, also with a very large market share. So it's probably one of the most evenly distributed market shares among major operators. And then you have Nextel still operating with it's sort of higher pay -- higher ARPU postpaid business as well. So 5 carriers competing, I would say, aggressively. The macro environment is a little unsteady right now, but these are companies that are look, taking, I think, a much longer view as well of that market. 200 million people, large and fairly stable middle class. Those of us that operate in that country have a pretty strong conviction that it's going to come out of its current situation eventually much more healthier and stronger trajectory. So we feel good about where we're at with Brazil. The leasing is going to be robust, not as robust as last though."

And in large part over the recent history of the mobile deployment and the industry, that has been largely tower-based. We continue to seek other multitenant real estate opportunities in the communication space. And I would also offer that we are in the multitenant small cell business. At this point in time, based on the spectrum involved, the cost of deployment, the difficulty -- relative difficulty in the small cell side of managing the network and the higher operating costs for the carriers when it comes to actually siting costs and tower, electrical power and especially backhaul costs, that's a modest part of at least our business today because, on a multitenant basis, our DAS business, which we're very proud of, actually, is about 3% of our U.S. tower operations revenue right now. We'd love to grow that. It is growing fast, 30% growth last year, which was terrific. Secondly, we have rooftops, which are also serving urban environments and are a multitenant offer. And those are about another 3%, Brett. And then we have other multitenant offerings like generators and such at the sites, which are about 1% of the U.S. revenue base. So all in, we're about 7% today in the U.S. This is U.S. revenue in percentages in non-tower multitenant leasing. And we would love to grow all portions of that, but we're going to go after the ones that we think have the best return and the best AFFO per share growth trajectory.

We are the #1 indoor small cell independent operator in the United States with over 300 locations, as you know. And we're ready to grow that business. We've already grown at 30% last year. So we're positioned in the place that we actually think has, by our own experience, has the most multitenant opportunity in the small cell space as in the small cell space. And our data that we do have, Brett, just as a reminder, to support that is our indoor or venue-based small cells, which include racetracks and stadiums, et cetera, have a tenancy right now of 2.3 tenants 4 -- per system. We do have a limited set of outdoor DAS properties, which we feel are going to become multitenant, but they're slower ramp-up. They're a little over 1 right now. So we're very, very focused on 2 things at the moment in the small cell space. That -- those are primarily indoor DAS systems, and secondly, outdoor systems in specific locations where we think there will be enough tenancy demand because of the situation. I know they're very limited, we think, at this point. That will get us to the ROIC objectives that we you have. So we're playing in all the bases, Brett, but we're really focusing on where we think the tenancy ramp-up is highest, and that's towers and indoor small cells right now."

I'll take the first one and Tom will take the second. When I look at scale of market, I look at it at 2 levels. Sort of level 1 is, what's the market position we need in a given country to cover our SG&A base and hit our risk-adjusted return on invested capital hurdle rate for that country. And I would say the vast majority of our markets and any -- all of the market, in fact, all of the markets that have large population, we have already obtained level 1 scale, all right? So we're in a position where we can cover SG&A, and our return already have hit our risk-adjusted return for the market. What we'd really like to get to in the major markets, and I'll go through those in a second, is what I'd like to call level 2 scale, which means not only can you cover your SG&A and meet your return on investment targets or exceed them, you can far exceed them because you've got asset position that puts you in a situation where you can be more of a strategic partner to the mobile operators in that country. And so let's just walk through quickly through the biggest markets. In the U.S., we're clearly at level 2 scale. We've got the biggest tower portfolio. We've got the leading multitenant indoor small cell portfolio. We've got a great position here and master lease agreements of one sort or another with all the carriers. If you go -- move south in Mexico, again, as I mentioned, clearly the #1 independent power operator there by revenue and sort of readiness of assets, if you will. Down to Brazil, again, clearly the #1 operator serving all those mobile operators in a partnership level, I would say, approach. And then moving to the other large markets very quickly. In Germany, we believe we're the largest independent. Even though for us it's a relatively small market, it's an important country. In Nigeria, I'd say we probably could use another acquisition to get to level 2 scale, but we're off to a really good start with Airtel right now. And in South Africa, again, we're at least sort of level 1. And if we can get another asset, we'll clearly be at level 2. And finally, in India, pre-Viom, we were squarely in the level 1 category and doing really well in that market with the assets we had. But the Viom transaction sort of launches us well into level 2 territory. We'll be the #2 independent operator. And that's if you sort of count this us an independent. And so therefore, I think when you go across the landscape with the major markets globally that we've elected to be in and we selectively chosen those, Mike, as you know, we're at level 2 scale or getting there, in the case of Viom."

The other one is clearly Viom because we are going to be picking up 51% interest there. As we talk about the last time, when we talked about this particular transaction, the path there is then to be able to merge our 2 businesses in the market, as you would expect and then ultimately see what happens with the remaining share to the extent that we did to that invest to be able to get to that 100%. Clearly, we believe that the integration or the synergies that we'll be able to generate from that business would more than offset any of the incremental cost that we will be incurring to pick up that 100% ownership. On the properties themselves, the land themselves in the United States, we just had a record year in 2015 in terms of the properties that we effected. We effected about 3,000 of our properties. About 2/3 of those were ones that we actually extended for periods up to 25 to 30 to 40 years. The balance were properties that we actually did acquire. I think the statistic right now is at 63%, 65% of our properties we either own or have for over 20 years, the average term on it is about 22 years. So we remain very active in that marketplace. And you can see from our CapEx, we expect to actually step up a bit in terms of the overall land with the Verizon tower portfolio that brought in a sizable number of new properties that we're looking to extend to the extent possible. So yes, very active in the U.S. and very focused. The benefits of what we had done last year from an acquisition perspective, I think, is generating a $5-plus million run rate benefit on the cost line. So it's definitely not just shoring up the property underneath the towers, but it's also giving us a bend and a curve, if you will, from a cost respective on the land side."

We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Then Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on our strategy; before Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, provides a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 as well as our full year outlook for 2016. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; anticipated closings of acquisitions and their anticipated contributions to our financial results; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings release; those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and in our other SEC filings. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
As we disclosed in our press release this morning, as the size of our international segment as a proportion of our total business continues to grow, especially in light of our pending acquisition in India, we have decided to change our reportable segments. As a result, we now operate in 5 segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and Services. Additionally, we have simplified our definition of full year organic core growth to be the average of the quarterly organic core growth rates in the year. This includes no change to the calculation methodology for the quarterly organic core growth metric.
And now turning to our financial results.
During the quarter, our property revenue grew over 21% to $1.25 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew over 21% to approximately $802 million. Our adjusted funds from operations increased by nearly 23% to approximately $542 million. And net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by nearly 22% to $206 million or $0.49 per basic and $0.48 per diluted common share.
From a full year perspective, our property revenue grew by nearly 17% to $4.68 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by over 15% to nearly $3.07 billion, and adjusted funds from operations increased 18.5% to approximately $2.15 billion. Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by $206 million from the prior year. The primary drivers of the year-over-year decline in net income were the onetime $93 million cash tax charge as part of our previously announced GTP REIT tax election, the $74 million loss as a result of our -- the retirement of our 7% senior notes and approximately $71 million in negative FX impacts from the remeasurement of our intercompany notes.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

And good morning to everyone on the call.
American Tower's 2015 results reconfirmed yet again the fundamental strength of the tower business model, the value of our portfolio diversification strategy across geographies, our focus on partnering with the leading mobile network operator tenants in the U.S. and around the world and our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Before introducing Tom, who will provide the details of our 2015 performance and 2016 outlook, I'll begin with a very brief update on the company's overall strategic direction, which should then leave plenty of time for your questions following Tom's remarks.
For many years now, we've consistently and relentlessly focused on advancing American Tower's leadership in communications real estate, and we believe that the resulting long-term performance of the business tells a compelling story. We've been able to drive double-digit core growth in property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share for 6 consecutive years now while at the same time growing our common stock dividend at well over 20% annually since introducing it in 2012. We anticipate continuing to build on this track record, which remains based on our company's long-standing 3 strategic pillars. In 2015, we achieved a number of accomplishments to position the company for future success in each of the 3 pillars.
Our first strategic pillar is building the asset scale to exceed our return on investment goals in select major markets. In this, we made tremendous progress in 2015. In our home U.S. market, American Tower secured the exclusive rights to lease or acquire nearly 11,500 sites from Verizon Communications. We also acquired over 4,700 sites from Airtel in Nigeria and nearly 5,500 sites from Telecom Italia in Brazil. We also built over 3,000 towers and DAS networks across our markets. And in India, the largest free-market democracy in Asia, we have signed a transformational deal with Tata and its current partners in Viom which will take our tower count there from 15,000 to over 57,000. This transaction is strategic for ATC, not simply because it increases our tower count but because it enables us to build even deeper business relationships with high-quality, multinational mobile network operators such as Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, Tata, Reliance and Aircel, which will all be bringing the mobile Internet to India's 1.2 billion people.
Our second strategic pillar is to focus on operational excellence to maximize the cash flow generated from each and every property. Among the most significant achievements in 2015 delivered by our operating units were containment of churn in our U.S. business due to skilled master lease contracting, the rapid and effective integration of assets in the cases of Verizon and TIM transactions and the efficient establishment of our new organization in Nigeria. This new market, staffed with both experienced ATC veterans and local professionals, delivered outstanding performance in new leasing business and in power and fuel management well in excess of its original business plan. And in India, our sales and operational teams generated the strongest tenant leasing growth we've seen in that market in a number of years.
Our third and final strategic pillar is to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to have efficient and consistent access to the markets to support our capital allocation program. Given the company's long and consistent record of operational performance and financial discipline, American Tower was able to maintain its investment-grade rating and thereby efficiently and effectively access a broad and deep range of capital sources. In 2015, we executed capital markets transactions, which included refinancings and new issuances totaling $21 billion, in order to fund our acquisition pipeline while at the same time reducing the average cost of our debt and increasing its average duration.
In summary. And as many of you may recall, 3 years ago, I laid out an aspirational goal to again double the size and performance of the business by 2017. We've already more than doubled the number of assets we own or operate worldwide. And pro forma for the Viom transaction, we will be at over 140,000. At the same time, throughout this portfolio expansion, our investment evaluation discipline has enabled us to maintain a return on invested capital above 9% despite having primarily lower-initial-tenancy and cash-flow sites to the base.
As a result, on a currency-neutral basis, our outlook for 2016 implies that we will have more than doubled our AFFO per share by 12/31, which should be a year ahead of schedule, which keeps us on a likely trajectory to achieve our aspirational objective on a reported basis by the end of the planning period in 2017.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a detailed review of our 2015 financial performance and our 2016 outlook."
24766,324564667,942403,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone.The fourth quarter wrapped up another year of strong global organic core growth and revenue, accretive acquisitions and new tower and DAS builds for American Tower. As Jim just highlighted, we believe that our success",2357,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone.
The fourth quarter wrapped up another year of strong global organic core growth and revenue, accretive acquisitions and new tower and DAS builds for American Tower. As Jim just highlighted, we believe that our success in 2015 has positioned us well for not only 2016 but also for many years to come, but before we get into the details of our 2016 expectation, let's dive into our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015.
So if you please turn to Slide 6. We achieved strong growth in all of our key metrics in the fourth quarter. Our total property revenue core growth was nearly 26%, which included another solid quarter of organic core growth at over 7%. As expected, our U.S. organic core growth was about 5.2%, which excludes the positive impact of a onetime settlement of $7.8 million. On a run rate basis, organic growth was about 6% in the U.S. for the quarter. Internationally, we generated organic core growth of over 12.5%. Consistent with our revenue growth, our adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was over 21% on a reported basis and over 26% on a core basis. Likewise, we converted the bulk of that adjusted EBITDA growth into AFFO with reported AFFO and AFFO per share growth of nearly 23% and over 15%, respectively. On a core basis, AFFO growth was about 30%.
Moving on to Slide 7. Our strong fourth quarter propelled us to exceed the high end of our previously issued outlook for property revenue, resulting in reported growth of 17% or 23% on a core basis. This revenue outperformance was driven by double-digit organic growth internationally and another year of solid activity in the U.S. For the year, in our U.S. market, our organic core growth was near the middle of our 5-year average target range at about 6.6%, excluding the positive impacts of a onetime $7.8 million settlement received in the quarter.
Our international markets generated organic growth rates significantly in excess of that of the U.S. coming in at nearly 11% on a consolidated basis. Our Latin American markets generated organic core growth of over 10%, where network investments remain a top priority despite some macroeconomic challenges. In India, we generated organic core growth of around 10% for the full year as large incumbent Indian wireless operators ramped their spending to support the deployment of new technologies and spectrum. And in our fastest-growing region, EMEA, organic core growth was over 13%.
Our strong finish to 2015 is a prime example of the strength of our diversified growth strategy, which leverages the benefits of operating in 13 different countries where our top dozen large multinational wireless customers are deploying a variety of different wireless technologies over different spectrum bands at different times. We believe that this diversification will support steady rates of growth for many years to come. And complementing our organic growth was the impact of the 22,000 sites we added from Verizon, Airtel and TIM, which contributed about 11% to our core growth rate for the year. Activity on these sites is right where we expected it to be, and we are especially encouraged by the performance of our Nigerian assets, which are already significantly exceeding our expectations for new business demand and are poised for strong growth going forward.
2015 was also a record year in terms of international new build activity with nearly 3,100 new towers completed by our global teams, which generated day 1 NOI yields of nearly 11%. In addition, we built more than 50 new DAS networks, largely indoor, globally in 2015, which generated day 1 NOI yields of over 12%.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our solid revenue growth, coupled with tight cost controls, resulted in strong margin performance across our business. Our gross margin, excluding pass-through for the year, remained above 80% despite the addition of over 25,000 new sites with an average initial tenancy of just 1.4. This was a result of our strong organic gross margin conversion rate of about 97%. In fact, adjusting for the impact of our recent acquisitions, our gross margin would have expanded to almost 83%. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin was essentially flat year-over-year despite the impact of our acquisitions, as we recognize the benefits of our global scale. And excluding the impact of acquisitions, we would have grown our adjusted EBITDA margin to 66.5%. Additionally, cash SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, declined over 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.6%, demonstrating a trend which we believe will continue. Our goal is to drive this metric below 8% into the future. 
Our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth in 2015 is detailed on Slide 9. Our teams delivered double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share for the sixth consecutive year despite the recent volatility in the currency markets. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 16%, or nearly 23% on a core basis, to approximately $3.1 billion. Reported AFFO grew by over 18% and 27% on a core basis, and AFFO per share grew by about 12% to $5.08 per share. This was driven by a strong adjusted EBITDA-to-AFFO conversion ratio of over 80%. And like property revenue, both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share exceeded the high end of our previously issued outlook.
Turning to Slide 10, let's now take a look at our expectations for 2016.
In 2016, at the midpoint of our outlook, we are projecting property revenue growth of about 20% on a reported basis and about 22% on a core basis. These numbers reflect our sizable new business pipeline coming into the year and our expectation that the positive demand trends underlying our 2015 organic growth will continue in 2016. For example, we expect international organic core growth in revenue to accelerate to just under 12%. As in 2015, we are poised to benefit from the diversification we have built in our asset base, with the acceleration of site-leasing activity in markets like Mexico and India being offset by some moderation in Brazil. Our 2016 international organic growth rate is also expected to benefit from rising escalators linked to the increasing local market inflation in many of our markets. Not only do these escalators help drive organic growth, but they also help offset foreign exchange translation effects over the long term.
In the U.S., we expect organic core growth in revenue to be in the mid-5% range. As we have discussed previously, there are a few items impacting this rate in 2016. While aggregate new business commencements are expected to be up year-over-year, the pacing of new business commencement activity in 2016 is expected to be distributed more evenly throughout the year, while it was more front-end loaded in 2015, which has a negative impact on the growth rate, as you would expect. Second, we expect our decommissioning revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year, which also puts pressure on the growth rate but is largely offset by less churn forecasted in the U.S. for the year. So while the rate is down for the year, we're excited about the increased new business activity on our portfolio in the U.S. as we finish up the year. On a cash run rate basis, as of year-end 2016, which normalizes for the impacts of timing differences and non-run-rate items, we expect growth to be approximately 6% in the U.S. Consequently, on a global consolidated basis, our overall organic core growth rate is expected to be about 7% for the year.
The components of our property revenue expectations for 2016 are outlined on Slide 11. In addition to the 7% or so of organic core growth that I just spoke about, we expect our new assets to contribute an additional 15% of core property revenue growth. This includes our pending Viom transaction, which we expect to contribute about $595 million to revenue during the year assuming a contribution of 9 months from the portfolio. New property revenue in 2016 also includes an incremental $265 million associated with the Verizon, TIM and Airtel assets we acquired in 2015, bringing the total incremental new asset growth in 2016 to about $860 million. About $280 million of this incremental $860 million in revenue is pass-through related.
Noncore items are forecasted to offset growth by about 6% and include an expected step-down in straight-line revenue of about $50 million and by foreign currency translation effects of around $180 million on our tenant revenues.
Moving on to Slide 12. We expect to convert our strong revenue growth into another year of double-digit adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share growth. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow over 13% for the year or about 21% on a core basis at the midpoint. This reflects cash SG&A, as a percentage of total revenue, of just 8%, which is down over 0.5 percentage point from 2015 levels. While our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be down around 3.5% from 2015 levels, this is entirely attributable to the addition of new assets, which initially have lower tenancy and cash flow but are poised to drive strong growth for the business well into the future. Excluding the impact of our new assets, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin will be growing by about 2% at the midpoint to over 66%.
Meanwhile, AFFO and AFFO per share growth are expected to be about 12% and over 10%, respectively, on a reported basis. And core AFFO is expected to grow approximately 18%. This includes strong contributions from our recently closed Verizon, TIM Brazil and Airtel Nigeria transactions; as well as our pending Viom acquisition. At the midpoint of our outlook, 2016 will represent the ninth straight year of double-digit AFFO per share growth for American Tower.
Turning to Page 13. We expect to maintain our disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive growth and improve yields across the business in 2016. Our first capital allocation priority continues to be our dividend, which has grown by an average of 26% since our REIT conversion just 5 years ago. In 2016, subject to the discretion of our board, we expect the dividend to continue to grow at least 20%. And as a result, we expect our payout ratio as a percent of AFFO to increase from current levels.
Next, we expect to selectively deploy capital to build between 2,500 and 3,000 new sites, primarily in our international markets where we generated day 1 new build ROIs of nearly 11% in 2015. In addition, we expect to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities while at the same time maintaining our path towards achieving a 5x net leverage ratio by the end of the year. We currently expect to be able to achieve our deleveraging goals by the fourth quarter, including the impact of funding our Viom acquisition with borrowings under our revolver and cash on hand. This is a result of strong growth in adjusted EBITDA as well as our continued repayment of debt throughout the year from our cash flow from operations.
Moving on to Slide 14. Illustrating the effectiveness of our capital allocation strategy in driving growth, we have a long history of generating double-digit growth rates in all of our key financial metrics. As a result, in just 4 years, as you can see in the slide, we've nearly doubled our property revenue and adjusted EBITDA and more than doubled our AFFO while at the same time growing our REIT distribution 26% on average each year since its inception. The combination of share price appreciation resulting from this strong financial performance and the growth of our REIT distribution has delivered our shareholders a total return of over 100% since 2011.
Turning to Slide 15. Our capital allocation has also driven significant improvements in NOI yields across the business. As you can see, our investments in lower-initial-tenancy sites are paying off with 300 to 600 basis points of yield improvement over a 4-year period. This type of NOI yield growth supports our ability to generate the cash flows we need to simultaneously fund our rapidly growing dividend as well as continue to invest in new growth assets. We expect to be able to drive similar NOI yield expansion on our recently acquired portfolios, which will further enhance our distribution potential for the long term.
Moving on to Slide 16 and in closing. We generated strong operating results in 2015, highlighted by another year of double-digit AFFO per share growth, while also significantly enhancing the company's long-term strategic positioning in several key markets through selective acquisitions and new site construction. Further, we meaningfully reduced our SG&A as a percentage of revenue while at the same time boosting our common stock dividend by nearly 30%. In 2016, we are focused on strategic priorities which support our vision of being a premier independent owner, operator and developer of communications real estate globally while driving similarly strong financial results. Operationally, we are focused on our daily execution, including driving strong growth across our existing asset base and leveraging the scale we've built across our global business to drive margin improvement. Strategically, we are taking a significant step towards achieving greater scale in India with the pending Viom transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the first quarter. And the integration of that portfolio will be a significant focus for our management team. As a result of this transaction, we expect to end the year with over 145,000 sites globally with annualized revenues of just under $6 billion.
Further, we remain on track to get back to 5x net leverage or below by year-end while maintaining our leading investment-grade balance sheet. This path contemplates the funding of our pending transactions as well as the capital spending outlook that we issued this morning.
So taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to generate meaningful AFFO per share growth in combination with a materially growing dividend. As a result, we expect to deliver a compelling total return to our stockholders for many years to come.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And so as we had talked about in 2012, our 5-year expectation was that 6% to 8% CAGR over that period of time in the U.S. domestic organic core growth, and we still see that as being fulfilled over this 5-year period.

Therefore, you have rooftops primarily serving urbans and dense urban.

And the existing infrastructure base, again, adding additional equipment to existing tower sites, is the most effective way to do this at any kind of scale. So we still believe that's going to be the case. If you look at spending on the radio access network, based again on our internal and external analyses, sort of our view is 95% or so of that radio access network spending is on the ""macro tower base, macro site"" scenarios and rooftops. So again, 5% on alternatives today. We see that actually growing to 10% over the next number of years, say, 4 to 5 years, but that still leaves 95% of the RAN spending in the U.S., in our view, remaining on the tower sites. Just it's the most effective and efficient way, again, we believe, to continue to build up the 4G network that everyone is going to need to do things like voice over IP; to do nice, solid 4G video but using much higher spectrum bands, yes. The only way, again, tangibly and feasibly to do these in the field, we believe, and where 85% of people live in the United States is still on the macro tower. So yes, there will be some increased spending, mainly in dense urban and urban, maybe 5% to 10% of the total RAN spending, but we still see plenty of upside for towers and long waves [ph] on the business here in the United States."

And we've gotten a really nice pipeline of those already. It does take a few weeks and months to get deployment schedules in place and equipment actually installed and billing, but the pipeline is really strong, as Tom said. On the other hand, as you go into these higher bands and you apply carrier aggregation and other approaches to adding those bands to your network, ultimately you're going to need a more dense network, sites closer together because the -- as you go, again, higher up in bands, you go shorter in effective radius. And if you're trying to create a consistent customer experience and you want to use 700 and 1.9 in the handoff or even on the same transmission site, you're going to have to design to that highest band. And therefore, sites ultimately are going have to be closer together over time. So again, we have a pipeline of new leases as well as amendments. And those leases are driven, on one hand, by the densification that I just described; and also by some carriers also expanding their actual deployment footprint geographically based on the benefits they now see of a bigger customer base versus roaming. So there are a couple of factors that are supporting the new lease side of the equation, as well as the amendment side."

Mexico is becoming a much more competitive mobile operator market with the new entrant, AT&T, of course.

So Mexico is a great environment for us. We're incredibly, well, strategically positioned to take advantage of it. And so as Tom said, it's going to be a positive contributor to us this year. Brazil is still strong, yes. Last year, it was actually quite robust, as far as new leasing. It's going to be robust in 2016, just not at the same level. But there are 4, again, very competitive, well-funded mobile operators there. 3 of the 4 operators are multinational leaders. Those are Telefónica, América Móvil and Telecom Italia, of course. And Oi is the sort of the country incumbent, the local country incumbent, also with a very large market share. So it's probably one of the most evenly distributed market shares among major operators. And then you have Nextel still operating with its sort of higher pay -- higher-ARPU postpaid business as well. So 5 carriers competing, I would say, aggressively. The macro environment is a little unsteady right now, but these are companies that are, look, taking, I think, a much longer view as well of that market: 200 million people, large and fairly stable middle class. Those of us that operate in that country have a pretty strong conviction that it is going to come out of its current situation in eventually a much more healthier and stronger trajectory.

And in large part over the recent history of the mobile deployment and the industry, that has been largely tower based. We continue to seek other multi-tenant real estate opportunities in the communications space. And I would also offer that we are in the multi-tenant small cell business. At this point in time, based on the spectrum involved; the costs of deployment; the difficulty, relative difficulty on the small cell side of managing the network; and the higher operating costs for the carriers when it comes to actually siting costs and power, electrical power and especially backhaul costs, that's a modest part of at least our business today because, on a multi-tenant basis, our DAS business, which we're very proud of actually, is about 3% of our U.S. tower operations revenue right now. We'd love to grow that. It is growing fast. It's been 30% growth last year, which was terrific. Secondly, we have rooftops which are also serving urban environments and are a multi-tenant offer. And those are about another 3%, Brett. And then we have other multi-tenant offerings like generators and such at the sites, which are about 1% of the U.S. revenue base. So all in, we're about 7% today in the U.S. This is U.S. revenue percentages in non-tower multi-tenant leasing. And we would love to grow all portions of that, but we're going to go after the ones that we think have the best return and the best AFFO per share growth trajectory. And that's why you see us in the proportions that we are today, but we -- those could be adjusted over time if the conditions for multi-tenant leasing improve because we will take full advantage of them when they do."

I mean we're in this for the long hauls. And we can't predict what the next technology is necessarily going to be or what the carrier adoption of those will be in the United States, but we are completely positioned across the waterfront that we're aware of right now to participate in these things. We are the #1 indoor small cell independent operator in the United States with over 300 locations, as you know. And we're ready to grow that business. We've already grown at 30% last year. So we're in a position in the place that we actually think has -- and by our own experience, has the most multi-tenant opportunity in the small cell space as indoor small cell space. And our data that we do have, Brett, just as a reminder, that supports that is our indoor or venue-based small cells, which include racetracks and stadiums et cetera, have a tenancy right now of 2.3 tenants for -- per system. We do have a limited set of outdoor DAS properties, which we feel are going to become multi-tenant, but they're slower ramp-up. They're a little over 1 right now. So we're very, very focused on 2 things at the moment in the small cell space. That -- those are primarily indoor DAS systems; and secondly, outdoor systems in specific locations where we think there will be enough tenancy demand because of the situation. And those are very limited, we think, at this point. That will get us to the ROIC objectives that we have. So we're playing in all the bases, Brett, but we're really focusing on where we think the tenancy ramp-up is highest, and that's towers and indoor small cells right now."

I'll take the first one, and Tom on the second. When it comes to scale of market, I look at it in 2 levels. Sort of level 1 is what's the market position we need in a given country to cover our SG&A base and hit our risk-adjusted return on invested capital hurdle rate for that country. And I will say the vast majority of our markets and any -- all of the market -- in fact, all of the markets that have large populations, we have already obtained level 1 scale, all right? And those -- we're in a position where we can cover SG&A and hit our return or already have hit our risk-adjusted return for the market. What we'd really like to get to in the major markets, and I'll go through those in a second, is what I'd like to call level 2 scale, which means not only can you cover your SG&A and meet your return on investment targets or exceed them. You can far exceed them because you've got an asset position that puts you in a situation where you can be more of a strategic partner to the mobile operators in that country. And so let's just walk quickly through the biggest markets. In the U.S., we're clearly at level 2 scale. And we've got the biggest tower portfolio. We've got the leading multi-tenant indoor small cell portfolio. We've got a great position here and master lease agreements of one sort or another with all the carriers. If you go, move south, in Mexico, again as I mentioned, clearly the #1 independent tower operator there by revenue and sort of readiness of assets, if you will. Down to Brazil, again, clearly the #1 operator serving all those mobile operators in a partnership level, I would say, approach. And then moving to the other large markets very quickly: In Germany, we believe we're the largest independent even though, for us, it's a relatively small market. It's an important country. In Nigeria, I'd say we probably could use another acquisition to get to level 2 scale. We're off to a really great start with Airtel right now. And in South Africa, again, we're at least at sort of level 1. And if we can get another asset, we'd clearly be at level 2. And finally, in India, pre Viom, we were squarely in the level 1 category and doing really well in that market with the assets we had, but the Viom transaction sort of launches us well into the level 2 territory. We'll be the #2 independent operator, and that's if you sort of count India's as an independent. And so therefore, I think, when you go across the landscape of the major markets globally that we've elected to be in, and we've selectively chosen those, Mike, as you know, we're at level 2 scale or getting there, as in the case of Viom."

Panama is an example: a relatively small market, but we didn't see a path or runway to be able to get to the kind of scale that we felt we needed to. And so we exited that market and redeployed that capital in other markets where we do feel we have the scale or clearly have a path to get to that scale. On the second question, relative to the investments that we have in the controlling interest, there are really 3. 2 are really very small. Uganda and Ghana are relatively small. We have controlling interest. We manage the properties very well, strong partners; don't anticipate any changes there. If we did, it would be immaterial to our overall results.

The other one, though, is clearly Viom because we are going to be picking up a 51% interest there. And as we talk about, the last time when we talked about this particular transaction, the path there is then to be able to merge our 2 businesses in the market, as you would expect; and then ultimately see what happens with the remaining share, to the extent that we did then invest to be able to get to that 100%. Clearly, we believe that the integration -- or the synergies that we would be able to generate from that business would more than offset any of the incremental costs that we would be incurring to pick up that 100% ownership. On the properties themselves, on the land themselves in the United States, we just had a record year in 2015 in terms of the properties that we effected. We effected about 3,000 of our properties. About 2/3 of those were ones that we actually extended for periods up to 25 to 30 to 40 years. The balance were properties that we actually did acquire. I think the statistic right now is that, 63%, 65% of our properties, we either own or have for over 20 years. The average term on it is about 22 years. So we remain very active in that marketplace. And you can see from our CapEx we expect to actually step up a bit in terms of the overall land with the Verizon tower portfolio that brought in a sizable number of new properties that we're looking to extend to the extent possible. So yes, very active in the U.S. and very focused. The benefits of what we had done last year from an acquisition perspective, I think, is generating a $5-plus million run rate benefit on the cost line. So it's definitely not just shoring up the property underneath the towers, but it's also giving us a bend and a curve, if you will, from a cost perspective at the -- on the land side."

We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Then Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on our strategy; before Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, provides a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 as well as our full year outlook for 2016. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; anticipated closings of acquisitions and their anticipated contributions to our financial results; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings release; those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and in our other SEC filings. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
As we disclosed in our press release this morning, as the size of our international segment as a proportion of our total business continues to grow, especially in light of our pending acquisition in India, we have decided to change our reportable segments. As a result, we now operate in 5 segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and Services. Additionally, we have simplified our definition of full year organic core growth to be the average of the quarterly organic core growth rates in the year. This includes no change to the calculation methodology for the quarterly organic core growth metric.
And now turning to our financial results. During the quarter, our property revenue grew over 21% to $1.25 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew over 21% to approximately $802 million. Our adjusted funds from operations increased by nearly 23% to approximately $542 million. And net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by nearly 22% to $206 million or $0.49 per basic and $0.48 per diluted common share.
From a full year perspective, our property revenue grew by nearly 17% to $4.68 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by over 15% to nearly $3.07 billion, and adjusted funds from operations increased 18.5% to approximately $2.15 billion. Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by $206 million from the prior year. The primary drivers of the year-over-year decline in net income were the onetime $93 million cash tax charge as part of our previously announced GTP REIT tax election, the $74 million loss as a result of our -- the retirement of our 7% senior notes and approximately $71 million in negative FX impacts from the remeasurement of our intercompany notes.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

And good morning to everyone on the call. American Tower's 2015 results reconfirmed yet again the fundamental strength of the tower business model, the value of our portfolio diversification strategy across geographies, our focus on partnering with the leading mobile network operator tenants in the U.S. and around the world and our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Before introducing Tom, who will provide the details of our 2015 performance and 2016 outlook, I'll begin with a very brief update on the company's overall strategic direction, which should then leave plenty of time for your questions following Tom's remarks.
For many years now, we've consistently and relentlessly focused on advancing American Tower's leadership in communications real estate, and we believe that the resulting long-term performance of the business tells a compelling story. We've been able to drive double-digit core growth in property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share for 6 consecutive years now while at the same time growing our common stock dividend at well over 20% annually since introducing it in 2012. We anticipate continuing to build on this track record, which remains based on our company's long-standing 3 strategic pillars. In 2015, we achieved a number of accomplishments to position the company for future success in each of the 3 pillars.
Our first strategic pillar is building the asset scale to exceed our return on investment goals in select major markets. In this, we made tremendous progress in 2015. In our home U.S. market, American Tower secured the exclusive rights to lease or acquire nearly 11,500 sites from Verizon Communications. We also acquired over 4,700 sites from Airtel in Nigeria and nearly 5,500 sites from Telecom Italia in Brazil. We also built over 3,000 towers and DAS networks across our markets. And in India, the largest free-market democracy in Asia, we have signed a transformational deal with Tata and its current partners in Viom which will take our tower count there from 15,000 to over 57,000. This transaction is strategic for ATC, not simply because it increases our tower count, but because it enables us to build even deeper business relationships with high-quality, multinational mobile network operators such as Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, Tata, Reliance and Aircel, which will all be bringing the mobile Internet to India's 1.2 billion people.
Our second strategic pillar is to focus on operational excellence to maximize the cash flow generated from each and every property. Among the most significant achievements in 2015 delivered by our operating units were containment of churn in our U.S. business due to skilled master lease contracting, the rapid and effective integration of assets in the cases of Verizon and TIM transactions and the efficient establishment of our new organization in Nigeria. This new market, staffed with both experienced ATC veterans and local professionals, delivered outstanding performance in new leasing business and in power and fuel management well in excess of its original business plan. And in India, our sales and operational teams generated the strongest tenant leasing growth we've seen in that market in a number of years.
Our third and final strategic pillar is to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to have efficient and consistent access to the markets to support our capital allocation program. Given the company's long and consistent record of operational performance and financial discipline, American Tower was able to maintain its investment-grade rating and thereby efficiently and effectively access a broad and deep range of capital sources. In 2015, we executed capital markets transactions, which included refinancings and new issuances totaling $21 billion, in order to fund our acquisition pipeline while at the same time reducing the average cost of our debt and increasing its average duration.
In summary, as many of you may recall, 3 years ago, I laid out an aspirational goal to again double the size and performance of the business by 2017. We've already more than doubled the number of assets we own or operate worldwide. And pro forma for the Viom transaction, we will be at over 140,000. At the same time, throughout this portfolio expansion, our investment evaluation discipline has enabled us to maintain a return on invested capital above 9% despite having primarily lower-initial-tenancy and cash-flow sites to the base.
As a result, on a currency-neutral basis, our outlook for 2016 implies that we will have more than doubled our AFFO per share by 12/31, which would be a year ahead of schedule, which keeps us on a likely trajectory to achieve our aspirational objective on a reported basis by the end of the planning period in 2017.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a detailed review of our 2015 financial performance and our 2016 outlook."

The fourth quarter wrapped up another year of strong global organic core growth and revenue, accretive acquisitions and new tower and DAS builds for American Tower. As Jim just highlighted, we believe that our success in 2015 has positioned us well for not only 2016 but also for many years to come, but before we get into the details of our 2016 expectation, let's dive into our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015.
So if you please turn to Slide 6. We achieved strong growth in all of our key metrics in the fourth quarter. Our total property revenue core growth was nearly 26%, which included another solid quarter of organic core growth at over 7%. As expected, our U.S. organic core growth was about 5.2%, which excludes the positive impact of a onetime settlement of $7.8 million. On a run rate basis, organic growth was about 6% in the U.S. for the quarter. Internationally, we generated organic core growth of over 12.5%. Consistent with our revenue growth, our adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was over 21% on a reported basis and over 26% on a core basis. Likewise, we converted the bulk of that adjusted EBITDA growth into AFFO with reported AFFO and AFFO per share growth of nearly 23% and over 15%, respectively. On a core basis, AFFO growth was about 30%.
Moving on to Slide 7. Our strong fourth quarter propelled us to exceed the high end of our previously issued outlook for property revenue, resulting in reported growth of 17% or 23% on a core basis. This revenue outperformance was driven by double-digit organic growth internationally and another year of solid activity in the U.S. For the year, in our U.S. market, our organic core growth was near the middle of our 5-year average target range at about 6.6%, excluding the positive impacts of a onetime $7.8 million settlement received in the quarter.
Our international markets generated organic growth rates significantly in excess of that of the U.S. coming in at nearly 11% on a consolidated basis. Our Latin American markets generated organic core growth of over 10%, where network investments remain a top priority despite some macroeconomic challenges. In India, we generated organic core growth of around 10% for the full year, as large incumbent Indian wireless operators ramped their spending to support the deployment of new technologies and spectrum. And in our fastest-growing region, EMEA, organic core growth was over 13%.
Our strong finish to 2015 is a prime example of the strength of our diversified growth strategy, which leverages the benefits of operating in 13 different countries where our top dozen large multinational wireless customers are deploying a variety of different wireless technologies over different spectrum bands at different times. We believe that this diversification will support steady rates of growth for many years to come. And complementing our organic growth was the impact of the 22,000 sites we added from Verizon, Airtel and TIM, which contributed about 11% to our core growth rate for the year. Activity on these sites is right where we expected it to be, and we are especially encouraged by the performance of our Nigerian assets, which are already significantly exceeding our expectations for new business demand and are poised for strong growth going forward.
2015 was also a record year in terms of international new build activity with nearly 3,100 new towers completed by our global teams, which generated day 1 NOI yields of nearly 11%. In addition, we built more than 50 new DAS networks, largely indoor, globally in 2015, which generated day 1 NOI yields of over 12%.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our solid revenue growth, coupled with tight cost controls, resulted in strong margin performance across our business. Our gross margin, excluding pass-through for the year, remained above 80% despite the addition of over 25,000 new sites with an average initial tenancy of just 1.4. This was a result of our strong organic gross margin conversion rate of about 97%. In fact, adjusting for the impact of our recent acquisitions, our gross margin would have expanded to almost 83%. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin was essentially flat year-over-year despite the impact of our acquisitions, as we recognize the benefits of our global scale. And excluding the impact of acquisitions, we would have grown our adjusted EBITDA margin to 66.5%. Additionally, cash SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, declined over 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.6%, demonstrating a trend which we believe will continue. Our goal is to drive this metric below 8% into the future. 
Our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth in 2015 is detailed on Slide 9. Our teams delivered double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share for the sixth consecutive year despite the recent volatility in the currency markets. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 16%, or nearly 23% on a core basis, to approximately $3.1 billion. Reported AFFO grew by over 18% and 27% on a core basis, and AFFO per share grew by about 12% to $5.08 per share. This was driven by a strong adjusted EBITDA-to-AFFO conversion ratio of over 80%. And like property revenue, both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share exceeded the high end of our previously issued outlook.
Turning to Slide 10, let's now take a look at our expectations for 2016. In 2016, at the midpoint of our outlook, we are projecting property revenue growth of about 20% on a reported basis and about 22% on a core basis. These numbers reflect our sizable new business pipeline coming into the year and our expectation that the positive demand trends underlying our 2015 organic growth will continue in 2016. For example, we expect international organic core growth in revenue to accelerate to just under 12%. As in 2015, we are poised to benefit from the diversification we have built in our asset base, with the acceleration of site-leasing activity in markets like Mexico and India being offset by some moderation in Brazil. Our 2016 international organic growth rate is also expected to benefit from rising escalators linked to the increasing local market inflation in many of our markets. Not only do these escalators help drive organic growth, but they also help offset foreign exchange translation effects over the long term.
In the U.S., we expect organic core growth in revenue to be in the mid-5% range. As we have discussed previously, there are a few items impacting this rate in 2016. While aggregate new business commencements are expected to be up year-over-year, the pacing of new business commencement activity in 2016 is expected to be distributed more evenly throughout the year, while it was more front-end loaded in 2015, which has a negative impact on the growth rate, as you would expect. Second, we expect our decommissioning revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year, which also puts pressure on the growth rate but is largely offset by less churn forecasted in the U.S. for the year. So while the rate is down for the year, we're excited about the increased new business activity on our portfolio in the U.S. as we finish up the year. On a cash run rate basis, as of year-end 2016, which normalizes for the impacts of timing differences and non-run-rate items, we expect growth to be approximately 6% in the U.S. Consequently, on a global consolidated basis, our overall organic core growth rate is expected to be about 7% for the year.
The components of our property revenue expectations for 2016 are outlined on Slide 11. In addition to the 7% or so of organic core growth that I just spoke about, we expect our new assets to contribute an additional 15% of core property revenue growth. This includes our pending Viom transaction, which we expect to contribute about $595 million to revenue during the year assuming a contribution of 9 months from the portfolio. New property revenue in 2016 also includes an incremental $265 million associated with the Verizon, TIM and Airtel assets we acquired in 2015, bringing the total incremental new asset growth in 2016 to about $860 million. About $280 million of this incremental $860 million in revenue is pass-through related. Noncore items are forecasted to offset growth by about 6% and include an expected step-down in straight-line revenue of about $50 million and by foreign currency translation effects of around $180 million on our tenant revenues.
Moving on to Slide 12. We expect to convert our strong revenue growth into another year of double-digit adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share growth. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow over 13% for the year or about 21% on a core basis at the midpoint. This reflects cash SG&A, as a percentage of total revenue, of just 8%, which is down over 0.5 percentage point from 2015 levels. While our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be down around 3.5% from 2015 levels, this is entirely attributable to the addition of new assets, which initially have lower tenancy and cash flow but are poised to drive strong growth for the business well into the future. Excluding the impact of our new assets, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin will be growing by about 2% at the midpoint to over 66%.
Meanwhile, AFFO and AFFO per share growth are expected to be about 12% and over 10%, respectively, on a reported basis and core AFFO is expected to grow approximately 18%. This includes strong contributions from our recently closed Verizon, TIM Brazil and Airtel Nigeria transactions; as well as our pending Viom acquisition. At the midpoint of our outlook, 2016 would represent the ninth straight year of double-digit AFFO per share growth for American Tower.
Turning to Page 13. We expect to maintain our disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive growth and improve yields across the business in 2016. Our first capital allocation priority continues to be our dividend, which has grown by an average of 26% since our REIT conversion just 5 years ago. In 2016, subject to the discretion of our board, we expect the dividend to continue to grow at least 20%. And as a result, we expect our payout ratio as a percent of AFFO to increase from current levels.
Next, we expect to selectively deploy capital to build between 2,500 and 3,000 new sites, primarily in our international markets where we generated day 1 new build ROIs of nearly 11% in 2015. In addition, we expect to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities while at the same time maintaining our path towards achieving a 5x net leverage ratio by the end of the year. We currently expect to be able to achieve our deleveraging goals by the fourth quarter, including the impact of funding our Viom acquisition with borrowings under our revolver and cash on hand. This is a result of strong growth in adjusted EBITDA as well as our continued repayment of debt throughout the year from our cash flow from operations.
Moving on to Slide 14. Illustrating the effectiveness of our capital allocation strategy in driving growth, we have a long history of generating double-digit growth rates in all of our key financial metrics. As a result, in just 4 years, as you can see in the slide, we've nearly doubled our property revenue and adjusted EBITDA and more than doubled our AFFO while at the same time growing our REIT distribution 26% on average each year since its inception. The combination of share price appreciation resulting from this strong financial performance and the growth of our REIT distribution has delivered our shareholders a total return of over 100% since 2011.
Turning to Slide 15. Our capital allocation has also driven significant improvements in NOI yields across the business. As you can see, our investments in lower-initial-tenancy sites are paying off with 300 to 600 basis points of yield improvement over a 4-year period. This type of NOI yield growth supports our ability to generate the cash flows we need to simultaneously fund our rapidly growing dividend as well as continue to invest in new growth assets. We expect to be able to drive similar NOI yield expansion on our recently acquired portfolios, which will further enhance our distribution potential for the long term.
Moving on to Slide 16, and in closing. We generated strong operating results in 2015, highlighted by another year of double-digit AFFO per share growth, while also significantly enhancing the company's long-term strategic positioning in several key markets through selective acquisitions and new site construction. Further, we meaningfully reduced our SG&A as a percentage of revenue while at the same time boosting our common stock dividend by nearly 30%. In 2016, we are focused on strategic priorities which support our vision of being a premier independent owner, operator and developer of communications real estate globally while driving similarly strong financial results. 
Operationally, we are focused on our daily execution, including driving strong growth across our existing asset base and leveraging the scale we've built across our global business to drive margin improvement. Strategically, we are taking a significant step towards achieving greater scale in India with the pending Viom transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the first quarter. And the integration of that portfolio will be a significant focus for our management team. As a result of this transaction, we expect to end the year with over 145,000 sites globally with annualized revenues of just under $6 billion. Further, we remain on track to get back to 5x net leverage or below by year-end while maintaining our leading investment-grade balance sheet. This path contemplates the funding of our pending transactions as well as the capital spending outlook that we issued this morning.
So taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to generate meaningful AFFO per share growth in combination with a materially growing dividend. As a result, we expect to deliver a compelling total return to our stockholders for many years to come.

They're going to have to have more equipment on them. And based on the topology and the population distribution in the United States, macro towers are primarily the way to get that done. And so as we had talked about in 2012, our 5-year expectation was that 6% to 8% CAGR over that period of time in the U.S. domestic organic core growth, and we still see that as being fulfilled over this 5-year period. And we've had a couple of really outsized high years in the middle of the period.

And the existing infrastructure base, again, adding additional equipment to existing tower sites, is the most effective way to do this at any kind of scale. So we still believe that's going to be the case. If you look at spending on the radio access network, based again on our internal and external analysis, sort of our view is 95% or so of that radio access network spending is on the macro tower base, macro site scenarios and rooftops. So again, 5% on alternatives today. We see that actually growing to 10% over the next number of years, say, 4 to 5 years, but that still leaves 95% of the RAN spending in the U.S., in our view, remaining on the tower sites. Just it's the most effective and efficient way, again, we believe, to continue to build up the 4G network that everyone is going to need to do things like voice over IP; to do nice, solid 4G video but using much higher spectrum bands. The only way, again, tangibly and feasibly to do these in the field, we believe, and where 85% of people live in the United States is still on the macro tower. So yes, there will be some increased spending, mainly in dense urban and urban, maybe 5% to 10% of the total RAN spending, but we still see plenty of upside for towers and long legs on the business here in the United States."

And so overall, you know what, as we've mentioned before, the 2015 consolidated growth rate was in that 8 -- 7.5% to 8%. And the 2016 is forecasted to be in that 7% range. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we expect the regions to pan out in '16."

And as you see AWS spectrum, and now we're hearing about WCS spectrum, on a higher band, if you will, having plans to be deployed in this country, you're going to see those amendments continue. And we've gotten a really nice pipeline of those already. It does take a few weeks and months to get deployment schedules in place and equipment actually installed and billing, but the pipeline is really strong, as Tom said. On the other hand, as you go into these higher bands and you apply carrier aggregation and other approaches to adding those bands to your network, ultimately you're going to need a more dense network, sites closer together because the -- as you go, again, higher up in bands, you go shorter in effective radius. And if you're trying to create a consistent customer experience and you want to use 700 and 1.9 in the handoff or even on the same transmission site, you're going to have to design to that highest band. And therefore, sites ultimately are going have to be closer together over time. So again, we have a pipeline of new leases as well as amendments. And those leases are driven, on one hand, by the densification that I just described; and also by some carriers also expanding their actual deployment footprint geographically based on the benefits they now see of a bigger customer base versus roaming. So there are a couple of factors that are supporting the new lease side of the equation, as well as the amendment side."

Mexico is becoming a much more competitive mobile operator market with the new entrant, AT&T, of course. And our position in the country is the largest, truly independent and operational provider of communication real estate in that country. So we're well positioned to serve both the incumbents that are already there, Telefónica and, of course, América Móvil; as well as AT&T as it brings together the Nextel and Iusacell businesses and makes those networks much more robust. So Mexico is a great environment for us. We're incredibly, well, strategically positioned to take advantage of it. And so as Tom said, it's going to be a positive contributor to us this year. Brazil is still strong, yes. Last year, it was actually quite robust, as far as new leasing. It's going to be robust in 2016, just not at the same level. But there are 4, again, very competitive, well-funded mobile operators there. Three of the 4 operators are multinational leaders. Those are Telefónica, América Móvil and Telecom Italia, of course. And Oi is the sort of the country incumbent, the local country incumbent, also with a very large market share. So it's probably one of the most evenly distributed market shares among major operators. And then you have Nextel still operating with its sort of higher pay -- higher-ARPU postpaid business as well. So 5 carriers competing, I would say, aggressively. The macro environment is a little unsteady right now, but these are companies that are, look, taking, I think, a much longer view as well of that market: 200 million people, large and fairly stable middle class. Those of us that operate in that country have a pretty strong conviction that it is going to come out of its current situation in eventually a much more healthier and stronger trajectory. So we feel good about where we're at with Brazil. Leasing is going to be robust, not as robust as last year, though."

And in large part over the recent history of the mobile deployment and the industry, that has been largely tower based. We continue to seek other multi-tenant real estate opportunities in the communications space. And I would also offer that we are in the multi-tenant small cell business. At this point in time, based on the spectrum involved; the costs of deployment; the difficulty, relative difficulty on the small cell side of managing the network; and the higher operating costs for the carriers when it comes to actually siting costs and power, electrical power and especially backhaul costs. That's a modest part of at least our business today because, on a multi-tenant basis, our DAS business, which we're very proud of actually, is about 3% of our U.S. tower operations revenue right now. We'd love to grow that. It is growing fast. It's been 30% growth last year, which was terrific. Secondly, we have rooftops which are also serving urban environments and are a multi-tenant offer. And those are about another 3%, Brett. And then we have other multi-tenant offerings like generators and such at the sites, which are about 1% of the U.S. revenue base. So all in, we're about 7% today in the U.S. This is U.S. revenue percentages in non-tower multi-tenant leasing. And we would love to grow all portions of that, but we're going to go after the ones that we think have the best return and the best AFFO per share growth trajectory. And that's why you see us in the proportions that we are today, but we -- those could be adjusted over time if the conditions for multi-tenant leasing improve because we'll take full advantage of them when they do."

And we can't predict what the next technology is necessarily going to be or what the carrier adoption of those will be in the United States, but we are completely positioned across the waterfront that we're aware of right now to participate in these things. We are the #1 indoor small cell independent operator in the United States with over 300 locations, as you know. And we're ready to grow that business. We've already grown at 30% last year. So we're in a position in the place that we actually think has -- and by our own experience, has the most multi-tenant opportunity in the small cell space as indoor small cell space. And our data that we do have, Brett, just as a reminder, that supports that is our indoor or venue-based small cells, which include racetracks and stadiums, et cetera, have a tenancy right now of 2.3 tenants for -- per system. We do have a limited set of outdoor DAS properties, which we feel are going to become multi-tenant, but they're slower ramp-up. They're a little over 1 right now. So we're very, very focused on 2 things at the moment in the small cell space. That -- those are primarily indoor DAS systems; and secondly, outdoor systems in specific locations where we think there will be enough tenancy demand because of the situation. And those are very limited, we think, at this point. That will get us to the ROIC objectives that we have. So we're playing in all the bases, Brett, but we're really focusing on where we think the tenancy ramp-up is highest, and that's towers and indoor small cells right now."

I'll take the first one, and Tom the second. When it comes to scale of market, I look at it in 2 levels. Sort of level 1 is what's the market position we need in a given country to cover our SG&A base and hit our risk-adjusted return on invested capital hurdle rate for that country. And I will say the vast majority of our markets and any -- all of the markets -- in fact, all of the markets that have large populations, we have already obtained level 1 scale, all right? And those -- we're in a position where we can cover SG&A and hit our return or already have hit our risk-adjusted return for the market. What we'd really like to get to in the major markets, and I'll go through those in a second, is what I like to call level 2 scale, which means not only can you cover your SG&A and meet your return on investment targets or exceed them, you can far exceed them because you've got an asset position that puts you in a situation where you can be more of a strategic partner to the mobile operators in that country. And so let's just walk quickly through the biggest markets. In the U.S., we're clearly at level 2 scale. And we've got the biggest tower portfolio. We've got the leading multi-tenant indoor small cell portfolio. We've got a great position here and master lease agreements of one sort or another with all the carriers. If you go, move south, in Mexico, again as I mentioned, clearly the #1 independent tower operator there by revenue and sort of readiness of assets, if you will. Down to Brazil, again, clearly the #1 operator serving all those mobile operators in a partnership level, I would say, approach. And then moving to the other large markets very quickly: In Germany, we believe we're the largest independent even though, for us, it's a relatively small market. It's an important country. In Nigeria, I'd say we probably could use another acquisition to get to level 2 scale. We're off to a really great start with Airtel right now. And in South Africa, again, we're at least at sort of level 1. And if we could get another asset, we'd clearly be at level 2. And finally, in India, pre Viom, we were squarely in the level 1 category and doing really well in that market with the assets we had, but the Viom transaction sort of launches us well into the level 2 territory. We'll be the #2 independent operator, and that's if you sort of count Indus as an independent. And so therefore, I think, when you go across the landscape of the major markets globally that we've elected to be in, and we've selectively chosen those, Mike, as you know, we're at level 2 scale or getting there, as in the case of Viom."

Clearly, we believe that the integration -- or the synergies that we'd be able to generate from that business would more than offset any of the incremental costs that we would be incurring to pick up that 100% ownership. On the properties themselves, on the land themselves in the United States, we just had a record year in 2015 in terms of the properties that we effected. We effected about 3,000 of our properties. About 2/3 of those were ones that we actually extended for periods up to 25 to 30 to 40 years. The balance were properties that we actually did acquire. I think the statistic right now is that, 63%, 65% of our properties, we either own or have for over 20 years. The average term on it is about 22 years. So we remain very active in that marketplace. And you can see from our CapEx we expect to actually step up a bit in terms of the overall land with the Verizon tower portfolio that brought in a sizable number of new properties that we're looking to extend to the extent possible. So yes, very active in the U.S. and very focused. The benefits of what we had done last year from an acquisition perspective, I think, is generating a $5-plus million run rate benefit on the cost line. So it's definitely not just shoring up the property underneath the towers, but it's also giving us a bend and a curve, if you will, from a cost perspective at the -- on the land side."

And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on the U.S. mobile market and our strategy. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations regarding future growth including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; anticipated closing of signed acquisitions and the impact of recently closed acquisitions; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in the other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relation tab on our website. In addition, on our IR website, you will also find our quarterly supplemental package, which includes expanded disclosure on the components of our revenue and revenue growth including historical trending of our run rate revenue, which reflects revenue associated with tenant leases that are typically noncancellable [ph] and include renewal options as well as annual escalation provision. We believe this disclosure will provide investors with greater visibility into the key drivers of our revenue model and a simple baseline on which to model our business. 
Accordingly, we have introduced a new metric to track the currency-neutral growth of the organic components of our run rate revenue, which we will refer to as property revenue run rate organic growth. To the extent you have any questions on the new disclosures, please don't hesitate to reach out to myself or another member of our Investor Relations team. 
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, our property revenue grew over 19% to nearly $1.27 billion. Total revenues grew over 19% to nearly $1.29 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% to approximately $833 million. Adjusted funds from operations increased by over 17% to approximately $602 million and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 25% to $248 million or $0.58 per diluted common share. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had a strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first",2240,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had a strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first quarter common stock dividend to $0.51 per share, which was up over 21% from the prior year period. And just last week, we closed our previously announced Viom transaction in India. Our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate Viom's more than 42,000 towers into our portfolio. This transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share, and we expect it will help us continue to deliver strong growth across our key financial metrics. 
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we drove strong growth in all of our key metrics in the first quarter, all in the 23% to 25% range on a core business. Our total property revenue growth of about 25% included consolidated organic core growth of nearly 9% or over 8% on an organic run rate basis which excludes the impact of decommissioning revenues. This strong revenue growth, combined with our disciplined expense management, led to double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share.
Turning to Slide 7. Our U.S. segment generated organic core growth of about 7.1% which includes the positive impact of $31 million of decommissioning revenue as compared to approximately $17 million recorded in Q1 of last year. On a run rate basis, again which excludes the decommissioning revenues, U.S. organic growth was in line with our expectations at about 5.9%. Our international markets generated organic growth over 600 basis points higher than the U.S. and over 350 basis points higher than it generated in Q1 of 2015 and over 13% on a consolidated basis, the highest rate in the last 2 years. On a run rate basis, organic growth was about 14% with escalators associated with rising local market inflation, contributing about 7% to our international run rate growth, and organic new business commencements were an even larger component of the growth at about 8%. That growth was partially offset by some churn of less than 1%. It was broad strength across our international property segments with all 3 posting double-digit organic core revenue growth rates. Our Latin American organic core growth was over 13% including 10% and 13% in Mexico and Brazil, respectively, as network rollouts remained consistent throughout the region even with some macroeconomic challenges. In India, we've generated organic core growth of over 12%, as large incumbent Indian wireless operators continued to spend aggressively to support the deployment of new technologies and spectrum. And in our fastest-growing region, EMEA, organic core growth was over 14% or 18% excluding our more mature German market. These strong growth rates continue to highlight the benefits of our diversification across countries, customers and technologies. 
On a global basis there are nearly 2.5 billion people in the markets that we serve and our largest customers will be investing tens of billions of dollars in those markets just this year to meet their customers' rapidly growing wireless needs. Complementing our organic growth on a consolidated basis were contributions for more than 25,000 sites built, leased and acquired since the beginning of last year including the Verizon, Airtel and TIM [ph] portfolios as well as the roughly 3,700 sites we built ourselves. Collectively, these new assets contributed over 16% to our core growth rate in the quarter and we're especially encouraged by the performance of our Nigerian assets which have so far exceeded our expectations for new business. Of the 3,700 new build sites, about 500 were completed this quarter, generating average day 1 NOI yields of over 10%. In addition, we also built 14 new indoor DAS or small cell networks in the quarter, many in our international markets. Within the U.S., where the indoor networks have been in place the longest, our tenants per node stands at approximately 2.3, driving gross margins in the 70% to 75% range. Our return on these investments is about 15%. Including those of Viom, we now have over 700 indoor DAS venues globally. 
Moving on to Slide 8. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Our gross margin excluding pass-through remained above 80% despite the impact of the additional 25,000 new lower tenancy, lower-margin sites we brought into our portfolio over the last year. This was a result of our strong organic gross margin conversion ratio of roughly 90%. We've been generating these types of conversion ratios for several years now. Adjusting for the impact of our recent acquisitions, this gross margin would've expanded to about 83%. 
Our land acquisition and extension team also made significant progress towards driving incremental NPV for the portfolio while enhancing our long-term U.S. gross margin and preserving future cash flows affecting more than 700 land leases this quarter by either acquiring them outright or extending them. About 50% of these transactions related to the Verizon portfolio. And as a result of our continued progress in this area over the last year, the percent of owned sites increased over 300 basis points in the U.S. from the prior year period to nearly 27% and the average remaining term of sites on leased land to increase to nearly 24 years. 
In addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased about 20 basis points year-over-year after excluding the impact of the lower margin, lower tenancy acquired sites. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined about 30 basis points year-over-year to about 8.4%. 
Our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth in the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% or about 24% on a core basis to approximately $833 million as a result of our top line growth, coupled with diligent operational expense management. A strong adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio of over 81% as well as some lower cash taxes and cash interest and capital improvement CapEx relative to our internal expectations led to AFFO growth of over 17%. On a core basis, AFFO growth was about 25% and AFFO per share grew by about 13% to $1.41 per share.
As a result of our solid first quarter performance and improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016 as detailed on Slide 10. At the midpoint of our outlook, we are raising our expectations for property revenue by $40 million or nearly 1%, resulting in projected growth of about 21% on both a reported and core basis. The increase is being driven primarily by $50 million in FX assumption favorability as compared to our prior outlook, partially offset by approximately $40 million associated with the delay in closing the Viom acquisition versus prior expectations. As you recall, we closed the Viom transaction on April 21 versus an expected April 1 closing. 
In addition, we expect the $20 million increase in past due revenue and around $9 million in incremental straight line revenues. Within our total revenue projections, we are reiterating our organic growth outlook for our U.S. and international businesses. We continue to expect mid-5% organic core growth for our U.S. property segment, given consistent activity levels that have been in line with the expectations we discussed in late February. As we have touched on previously, there are a few items impacting this rate in 2016 versus 2015 including more evenly distributed new business versus it being more front-end loaded last year and flat decommissioning revenue which are being partially offset by lower churn expectations as compared to 2015. On an ending run rate basis as of December, growth for 2016 is expected to be closer to 6%. Internationally, organic growth is still expected to be nearly 12%. At a consolidated level, our expectation for total organic core growth remains unchanged at approximately 7% for the year or nearly 8% on a run rate organic growth basis. Newly acquired and built sites, which includes the impact of Viom, are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated core growth for the year for about 14%. 
Our outlook highlights the benefits of the increasing diversification of our revenue base and our decreasing dependence on any one country to deliver consistent and predictable growth. We're a vital provider of communications real estate in vibrant markets like Mexico where aggressive 4G rollouts are ramping up; in Brazil, where significant 3G network augmentation is continuing; and in India, with the transition from 2G is only now getting underway for the majority of the population. This diversification supports our ability to generate consistent sustainable growth rates on a consolidated basis. 
Our improved revenue growth outlook and strong conversion rates are in turn expected to lead to a higher 2016 adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $25 million or nearly 1% at the midpoint. This reflects a negative $20 million impact due to the delayed Viom closing, but this is being more than offset, however, by a $10 million increase in cash EBITDA projected from our existing business as a result of better cost performance as well as an expected $35 million benefit from improving foreign currency exchange forecast and incremental net straight-line impacts. 
As detailed on Slide 11, we are also raising our outlook for AFFO by $20 million at the midpoint or nearly 1% versus our prior outlook, despite the negative $20 million impact of the delayed Viom close on cash adjusted EBITDA. The impact of the delay is being partially offset by a $10 million increase and expected legacy cash EBITDA, a $5 million decrease in the combination of cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures on an FX-neutral basis as well as a benefit of approximately $25 million resulting from the improvement in foreign currency forecast. As a result, assuming a weighted average diluted share count of 429 million shares, the midpoint of our outlook now implies an AFFO per share of $5.65, representing year-over-year per share growth of over 11%.
Turning to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we declared over $240 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed nearly $160 million in CapEx in Q1. We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders to our REIT distributions will create meaningful value for our stockholders. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our REIT distribution subject to board approval of at least 20%. 
We are also contributed to maintaining a substantial base of liquidity and a solid balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio stood at 5x net debt to annualized Q1 adjusted EBITDA, with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below, and longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3x and 5x. As a result of our consistent capital deployment strategy, we expect to extend our track record of delivering strong financial results in 2016 as is detailed on Slide 13 and, even more importantly, are positioning ourselves for strong sustainable growth going forward. In fact, at the midpoint of our outlook, we would've grown property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO at a mid-teen percentage clip since 2007 while at the same time maintaining return on invested capital of between 9% and 10%, despite adding over 25,000 new sites since the beginning of 2015. We expect these new sites will enhance our future growth trajectory over the long term while enhancing total returns.
Turning to Slide 14. And in summary, we started 2016 with a strong operational quarter, announced our entry into Tanzania, built nearly 500 sites and closed our acquisition of a controlling stake in Viom Networks just last week. Our top priority remains driving continued operational excellence while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to sustain strong growth in all of our key metrics and margin performance and are raising our 2016 outlook for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Similar to last year, we expect core growth in all 3 to be above our long-term targets. By year-end, we expect to have nearly 150,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and leverage back within our target range. Due to our disciplined consistent global capital allocation program, we continue to generate strong organic core revenue growth supported by a high-quality asset base diversified across geographies, carriers and network technologies, with a global portfolio more than triple the size of our closest U.S. publicly traded peers. Our significant exposure to high growth markets and our carefully cultivated asset base positions us to not only benefit from significant near-term network investments but to also deliver strong and steady growth over the long term. As a result, we expect to continue to generate consistent recurring growth in AFFO per share and a highly compelling total returns to stockholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

The first quarter results we've just reported today again demonstrate continued solid demand for tower space both in the U.S. and in our diversified international markets. In the United States, cons",1209,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. The first quarter results we've just reported today again demonstrate continued solid demand for tower space both in the U.S. and in our diversified international markets. 
In the United States, consumers' ever-increasing appetite for mobile bandwidth has supported cumulative wireless carrier CapEx of nearly $180 billion over just the last 5 years with approximately another $95 billion in spectrum auction spending as well. The deployment of 4G technology at spectrum bands has driven significant colocation during this period due to the need for a more dense network array. In addition, each new spectrum band acquired and deployed into the network has driven additional amendment activity in the form of more antennas and remote radio heads on our towers. 
In the United States, the 4 major wireless carriers are at or close to the completion of their Phase 1 coverage deployment of 4G technology. So what does this mean for the level of demand for tower space going forward domestically? The primary message of my remarks today is that we expect demand for macro tower space to remain robust as mobile operators progress through their subsequent deployment phases for 4G and then on to 5G deployments thereafter. 
Our conclusions are based on a combination of internal and external analyses the we've conducted over the past 2 years. Now in the past, you've heard us describe many of the technical and economic factors that support the continued use of towers as the optimal siting solution for mobile transmitters especially in suburban and rural environments and along transportation corridors such as highways. Today, I'd like to focus the discussion at a much more personal level: the factors that drive a satisfying user experience on our mobile devices. Each of us is very familiar with these performance factors as we use our smartphones every day. These factors are first, coverage; second, capacity; and third, and more importantly, as time goes on, peak speed. So coverage, capacity and peak speed. So let's say you're taking the Metro North train for your commute from [indiscernible] to the Grand Central Station, a ride of about 45 minutes or so. Along that route, most of your trip would be served by wireless transmission sites on macro towers including our towers in Harrison, the Merrimack [ph] and in the Bronx. While on the train, you want to watch cnn.com video clips for the day's news on your phone. Coverage would be represented by the number of signal buyers you see at the upper left hand corner of your screen, and by the way, it's this coverage. Capacity, meanwhile, would determine how many people on the train could watch streaming video at the same time as you. If capacity is insufficient, even if the coverage bars are there, then many of the viewers will experience buffering, they'll start to see the spinning wheel that we all dread instead of the video we want to watch. And finally, peak speed will determine the quality of that video experience. Does it come cross crisp, or is it grainy, choppy and pretty much unwatchable? So coverage, capacity and speed all need to be there to give you a good user experience. 
Based on the level of investment by your particular wireless service provider, your experience could vary drastically on each of these dimensions as you progress along your commute. We're now at the stage where most U.S. wireless carriers have deployed the majority of their 4G coverage sites. So in practice, the vast majority of us, U.S. mobile subscribers, have access to 4G bars when you look at our phone. The anticipated 6x increase in mobile traffic from 2015 to 2020, however, can't just be solved through these Phase 1 coverage sites. Wireless carriers are continuing to make significant investments in their networks to increase capacity across most of their sites including in suburban and rural areas and also along those transportation corridors. This capacity augmentation happens in 2 ways. First, carriers can add new spectrum bands, often resulting in amendments on our sites to new larger modern [ph] frequency antennas. We're seeing this with bands such as AWS 3, WCS and 2.5 gigahertz already. And second, wireless carriers are actively refarming 2G and 3G spectrum into 4G to gain better spectral efficiency across all of their spectrum. This is currently being implement it across the cellular 800 megahertz band by some carriers as well as PCS bands and also drives amendments on our towers as older antennas are typically swapped out for larger more advanced antennas when the refarming of spectrum occurs. 
In addition to their focus on coverage and capacity, you've been seeing in their advertisements that carriers have also now started to shift their marketing towards an emphasis on peak speeds. This shift drives further investment into cell sites through technologies such as carrier aggregation as well as adding new cell sites to reduce the transmission radius and, therefore, the quality improvement for each signal. This increase in cell site density is expected to drive incremental colocation opportunities on macro towers as customers like us demand higher and higher peak speeds to enhance our user experience. All this points to not only significant continuing 4G LTE investments but also to the subsequent deployment of 5G, which is not expected to be widely available until at least the 2020 time frame, though some free standard or trial deployments are possible over the intervening next few years. 
So similar to 3G and 4G deployments in the past, 5G is likely to start in those dense urban environments in which capacity and signal strength challenges are the greatest and then spread to suburban rural locations over time. While very high frequency bands of spectrum such as millimeterwave might be effective for 5G in dense urban mobile environments and maybe as a fiber to home substitute, it's our view that lower band spectrum will continue to be used for mobile 5G service in suburban and rural areas where our towers are located given the need for broader coverage and a less acute requirement for point capacity. 
Coincidentally, the 600 megahertz spectrum currently being auctioned should be cleared in the same general 2020 time frame as the commencement of large scale 5G deployments. The newly available 600 megahertz spectrum could be used for 5G rollouts outside of dense urban locations without disrupting 4G spectrum bands already in use or causing significant interference. As a result, carriers would once again need to install additional or larger multi-band antennas on towers, which we would expect to result in incremental revenue growth for us. Even that more than 80% of the U.S. population resides outside of urban areas, we view this as a long-term opportunity for our 5G portfolio -- for our portfolio as 5G gets implemented down the road. 
So to summarize, even in a 5G world, we believe that macro towers will continue to be a foundational building block for mobile network deployments in the U.S. and globally. Consequently, we are confident that demand for tower space will continue to remain robust for many years to come.

The kind of the run rate metric that Leah talked about in her opening remarks is a new metric that we're adding. We talked about it the last time we were together, but it isolates just kind of the recurring leased space run rate revenue that we generate on an FX-neutral basis, and we think it provides more transparency into the components which really drive the tenant run rate growth. And so that's what is driving the 5.9%, so it excludes decommissioning revenues and those types of things back billing, amortization revenue, those types of things. And we think it gives more clarity in terms of what really is the run rate growth in the business. The 5.5% is our traditional core organic growth, which is the one that we've historically talked about which represents the kind of the same tower store growth on those assets that we've owned for at least 12 months. And so that's what's really driving the difference between the 2 metrics. And on the Viom piece, in 2016, we now expect to generate about $555 million of revenue from Viom, about $245 million in gross margin contribution, I think around $215 million in EBITDA, and that represents the closing as of the April 21. Going forward, over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll look to merge our existing legacy business, which is our 15,000 sites that we have within ATC India, generates a couple of hundred million dollars a year, with the Viom business. And then, over time -- and that will take our ownership interests up from the current 51% to the mid-60s. And then, following that period of time, we'll look at whether or how -- financially what makes sense in terms of bringing the rest of the business. I mean it's our objective that we would want to own 100% of the business. We have some very strong partners within the business including the Tatas and Macquarie. So we're really excited about controlling the business, running the business with that kind of participation. So I would expect over the next 3 to 4 years we'll have more clarity in terms of just what we ultimately end up with from an ownership perspective of the business. But our immediate goal is to merge the 2 business where then we can really start to recognize what we believe are some synergies."

First of all, the overall CapEx from year-to-year in the U.S. wireless industry is expected to be flat around $30 billion. So if there are moderated ups and downs from individual carriers, the total is looking to be about the same, which means our aggregate new business opportunity among the major tower operators ought to look similar from 2015 to 2016. That's how we introduced our guidance and informed our guidance. And at the end of the day, we're looking more at the overall markets now especially with the segment reporting we've moved to. And so the U.S. run rate leasing metric that Tom talked about is we expect 6% or so in the United States, which is very solid. The other thing I'd like to say about the run rate metric, we're giving you yet another lens to look at the business. I think it's a good lens because it actually -- it's very similar to the way a lot of real estate investors look at the assets, which is what are your rent increases and rent pricing over time and what's your occupancy increases over time. And that really does encapsulate all of that in the run rate and it takes out some of these amortized contributions and other one-time settlements and things like that, that cause you to have to pull them apart to figure out what the real run rate is. So we're just going to give that to you. So you take the U.S. 6% run rate and you know the other part of our strategy is diversification across carriers, technology, continents, et cetera, and our international run rate leasing is 14% this year. So the weighted average is about 8%, and this is what we're trying to preserve over many, many years, which is a weighted average smooth rising curve of revenue growth, which then drives the double-digit expectation and objective we have for AFFO per share growth. So individual carriers in the U.S. are really important, but we're looking at more the market level now. And when you look at the aggregates, we still got $30 billion of spending and 6% of run rate growth in the domestic business. And then the last thing I'll say, and Tom referred to it a couple of times is, we're really starting to focus on efficiency especially in the domestic business to get cost out of it, performance to be at or above as far as revenue and top line growth, and that's going to help us with the AFFO per share contribution from the U.S. over time as well. So I really think it's important if you want to understand the carriers individual plans to refer to their public statements specifically or talk to them individually. But we're really going to be looking at market level and regional level and trends from this point on."

John, as I think you know, we don't speak to individual contract negotiations or even outcomes with the mobile operators really anywhere. We've described that we have offered holistic type agreements when mobile operators are in server ramp-up or in high higher spend mode, and that helps them in a couple of ways. One is to budget more accurately and understand what their cost will be going forward. And secondly, it reduces the cycle times and, therefore, increases the surety of when their deployments will be implemented as far as the schedule perspective. So those benefits are still there. Some of the mobile operators are taking advantage of those now. Some of them have decided to either stay on or move toward or away from a more retail type of operation. So without specifying any of those, those are the range of options and carriers move among those options based on their divestment cycle, which again speaks to the benefit of diversification when you can do those model type contracts. So secondly, on the in-building side, I would like to think we are a bit of a pioneer in a way, especially in Latin America, to introduce this technology. It will come into EMEA and especially African next on our part. But Mexico and Brazil have been really strong for us on in-building, and Viom, to its credit, is more of a pioneer in, in-building in the India market where the couple of hundred venues much more actually than we've announced. So that's actually a very good match on the small cell sites as well, Viom and ATC India. But those are probably the 3 places with the most opportunity right now, Mexico, Brazil and India."

What's happening in Mexico right now is something again that's happened in the U.S. and other markets earlier, and that is the rate of 4G adoption can be sort of governed, if you will, by 2 things in any market. One is service pricing and the other one is handset pricing. So the lower the handset pricing, the lower the service pricing, the more people can afford it, will sign up and start using it and grow over time in their usage. So in Mexico, the government successfully increased the level of competition in that country. Service pricing moved in a constructive way for the population to be able to adopt data services more rapidly than they could before. And globally, handset pricing for 4G is also reducing at the same time. So you have these 2 complementary cost unit reductions in handsets and service pricing and people in Mexico are signing up. So that then, as we've only seen, in every other case, increased smartphone penetration, 3G, usage, and ultimately, 4G drives gigabits per month on the network, and that network demand needs to be serviced in large part often by adding equipment to real estate and including towers. It's the typical cycle we've seen, but I'd say the 2 drivers that reduce handset pricing reduce service pricing for data."

So historically, we thought of escalators as being something north of 3% [ph] for your business particularly in the United States. But escalators, as we all know, is supposed to be tied to inflation. That's essentially the whole purpose of why they're designed. And inflation, as we all know, both when we look backwards as well as I think when we look forward, is much less than that right now. And I'm curious if because of that, you're starting to see some pushback on the escalators on new deals that are signed in the United States, and you're still able to achieve the 3-plus percent that actually now is something closer to, for example, 2%. And then my second question just goes back to some of the comments Jim made talking about the U.S. market. I think one of the things that's going to be different with the buildout of 5G relative to previous generational builds is the use of outdoor small cells. And it looks like from the topology perspective, particularly when you think of some the higher band frequencies that are going to be used, small cells are going to command a greater portion of the overall investment dollars for network buildouts, and that historically happened. And I'm curious if you think that that's going to win the level of macro tower growth you're going to see in the United States tied to 5G versus the growth rate we've seen in previous generation buildouts?"

So of course, as an inflation kind of concept second order behind that, but land rent costs are the largest cost of an ongoing tower operations and ground lessors have been able to secure 3-plus percent escalators off on our ground leases. So those are mirrored in the tower lease. Moving to the outdoor small cell 5G issue, I would invite you to get a hold of Leah separately because we've got some pretty in-depth technical assessments on how this works, whether it's a 3G, 4G or 5G. And yes, in dense urban networks -- dense urban environments, networks do have to have much shorter transmission radii. Small cells make sense for them for 3G, 4G and ultimately it will make sense for 5G. But what we serve is the suburban rural and transportation corridor market, not urban or dense urban. 97.5% of our towers are in non-dense urban environments, and the reason that carriers use towers predominantly in those environments because that is the optimal height, power setting and transmission radius for suburban rural and transportation corridor used cases. The proportion of small cell spending, our projection is that yes, as a percentage of CapEx, will double over the next 5 years from 5% to approximately 10%. That's our estimate. Therefore, we think 90% of the spend rate or so is going to continue to be on macro sites, mainly towers, and also rooftops and more urban environment. So that's how we see going forward again. If you want more depth in some of the detail, we can even provide a separate session for everybody that wants that. Just contact Leah."

And then just secondly on the Verizon performance on towers, could you just give us an update on what you're seeing on the demand front and latest expectations for lease-up activity in 2016."

I will speak to the Viom integration. The most important part of the integration from a commercial standpoint is when salesforce [indiscernible] to the customer which is in the process of being implemented right now and that's on the fast track. The second largest piece from again a customer and revenue point of view will be the integration of multiple master lease agreements between the 2 portfolios among many customers. That's going to take probably 12 to 18 months to really get those consolidated, but those things have already started. As far as leasability of the sites, Viom has been run as an independent third-party tower company already. And therefore, the documentation, the systems, the data to be able to quickly lease sites is largely already there. That's a difference than, say, a carrier portfolio like Verizon where you have to at least collect a lot of that from field offices or such. So the Viom integration from an effective leasability standpoint is going to be I think on a very fast track. This will be -- this entire portfolio, this combined portfolio is going to be jointly marketed to our customer base early on, and we're already in volume discussions with many of them as to how they can take advantage of the now #1 independent tower company in India, along with our traditional serve operating capabilities that they've come to serve and respect. So I see Viom integration was 12 to 18 months to get it, completely renegotiate around the master contracts and have some of the fieldwork done and some of the organizational alignments fully completed. As to Verizon, we've said just recently in the last call and it's still the case, we have a 9% to 10% long-term sort of cumulative average growth rate expectation over 10 years for that portfolio and we still do. So every month or 2, it's not going to change, I can't imagine materially. We're seeing new business on the sites. They're in really great shape as far as the carrier portfolio for capacity ground space, the documentation I referred to earlier. So we're progressing through our plan and expect to be able to deliver what we've stated in the past."

Even before we get the 5G, one of the things that's happening now, and this is something Verizon discussed with an analyst earlier this week, is that carriers are moving to a centralized [indiscernible] design. So they're taking some of the equipment that historically been at tower locations and moving them to central locations. However, Verizon also said that in many cases, these central locations are other macro sites. And so since this is happening now and I imagine you're seeing some of it going on at your sites, how does this affect your business? I mean are you seeing some reduction of footprints in other one someplace that meaningful increases in the carriers footprint in other locations? And on net what does this mean for you?"

There are some offsets, like you said, but generally, the way our contracts are structured, the vast majority of the lease rate, if you will, and none of it is separable or separable, if you will, but the vast majority of the pricing calculation is really what goes on the tower, not necessarily on the ground. Again, not of it's severable. So because you took one sort of cabinet off of your ground space, you're still paying for the square foot footprint of that ground space, and you put whatever you want on it. So we don't intend to reduce prices because someone move the cabinet from one place to another and took it off the site. One of the benefits of central RAN [ph] or cloud RAN [ph] in our view is that if these up more resources for the radio access network, the transmission equipment that goes up on the tower, which again we charge for, and that's most of the amendments have to deal with. So over the long term we think RAN decentralization or cloud RAN is going to be constructive for our lease growth on our sites because it's much less, and I think a couple of mobile operators have said this, it's reducing their core network cost fairly significantly, that more resources could then be potentially devoted to the radio access network which gain 90% of that we think will be spent on tower and related rooftop sites."

Again our sites tend to have substantial ground space. What's been helpful, for example, is one say Nextel went from having essentially a tractor-trailer full of equipment on the site down to today's Sprint 2 cabinets and a much smaller footprint. The miniaturization of the base station electronics has actually helped us free up more ground space over time. Now there are cases when we need to get more because we have multiple customers now, which is great. But yes, I think we're going to be in good shape to be able to host, not only sort of extra cloud RAN equipment on-site which are closer to the edge of the network what but also distributed someday could be an opportunity for distributed storage, caching especially entertainment type volumes of data at the tower site to reduce the latency of the transmission of content. That's something down the road that our ground space can be useful. And we have some examples in our international markets where we're doing fiber ducts are other sort of very closely related and so uses of ground space for incremental amendment. So we'll get every dollar we can at every square foot of ground we can, but I think it's a little bit of a long cycle again kind of therapeutic trend."

Well, since 2007 position business development teams [indiscernible] in Asia and Latin America. It's always be ready if mobile operators or others were willing to divest of their sites or engage in some kind of a merger with us. So you're referring to some successes we've had in Brazil, India and Nigeria recently. We're still pursuing those. We're pursuing them in full understanding of what our leverage targets are and Tom keeps very close triangulation on all of that with the EVPs that run the region. So everybody is well aware of what the parameters are here. In Europe, specifically, the team in that region is carefully evaluating the situation right now where there have been some movements, either privately held companies or public tower companies or carrier performance being separated and spun out, et cetera. But they're evaluating it carefully in the context of our disciplined kind of approach that Tom referred to already. And then perhaps, the biggest factor in any of these deals, whether it's in Asia, the U.S. or Europe or elsewhere, is the asset pricing at that moment versus the expected revenue and EBITDA growth rates through the medium and long term. And when there's a dislocation between asset pricing and those long-term prospects, you do not see us that. Any major investment for us, especially given the scale we're at today and the diversification we have today, actually someone needs to enhance the expected performance of our existing asset portfolio. So something we do on top of the transactions and organic growth we've already done has to make the whole cash flow curve better over time. And so those deals are difficult to find especially when you impart the discipline and publications that are the hallmarks of our investment committee, which is, me, Tom, and our General Counsel, Ed here. So it's one process and this is one example, not to try to make any kind of prediction for any other region. But you'll recall that we entered the India market in 2007. We kind of deliberately built the business a piece at the time of increasing the size over a 9-year period before securing the leading position in the market with Viom. So if that's what it takes, that's what we'll do. On the other hand, the opportunities emerge quickly like in Nigeria, there were 3 trades and within sort of 9 to 12 months. We're very active in those as well. So it's hard to predict. The environment the M&A environment is not suggested by the seller but also by the buyer to community. And if asset prices are too high, you're not going to see us that active. But that's if prices are within our investment criteria, you'll see us move very quickly to move forward. So really not much specific to say that we're out there, we're active and we still use the same process and asset pricing reporting to us."

We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab on our website. In addition, on our IR website, you will also find our quarterly supplemental package, which includes expanded disclosure on the components of our revenue and revenue growth including historical trending of our run rate revenue, which reflects revenue associated with tenant leases that are typically noncancelable and include renewal options as well as annual escalation provisions. We believe this disclosure will provide investors with greater visibility into the key drivers of our revenue model and a simple baseline on which to model our business. 
Accordingly, we have introduced a new metric to track the currency-neutral growth of the organic components of our run rate revenue, which we will refer to as property revenue run rate organic growth. 
To the extent you have any questions on the new disclosures, please don't hesitate to reach out to myself or another member of our Investor Relations team. 
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, our property revenue grew over 19% to nearly $1.27 billion. Total revenues grew over 19% to nearly $1.29 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% to approximately $833 million. Adjusted funds from operations increased by over 17% to approximately $602 million. And net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 35% to $248 million or $0.58 per diluted common share. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
24766,330366940,967497,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had a strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first",2235,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had a strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.51 per share, which was up over 21% from the prior year period. And just last week, we closed our previously announced Viom transaction in India. Our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate Viom's more than 42,000 towers into our portfolio. This transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share and we expect it will help us continue to deliver strong growth across our key financial metrics. 
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we drove strong growth in all of our key metrics in the first quarter, all in the 23% to 25% range on a core business. Our total property revenue growth of about 25% included consolidated organic core growth of nearly 9% or over 8% on an organic run rate basis, which excludes the impact of decommissioning revenues. This strong revenue growth, combined with our disciplined expense management, led to double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share.
Turning to Slide 7. Our U.S. segment generated organic core growth for the quarter of about 7.1% which includes the positive impact of $31 million of decommissioning revenue as compared to approximately $17 million recorded in Q1 of last year. On a run rate basis, again which excludes the decommissioning revenues, U.S. organic growth was in line with our expectations at about 5.9%. Our international markets generated organic growth over 600 basis points higher than the U.S. and over 350 basis points higher than it generated in Q1 of 2015 and over 13% on a consolidated basis, the highest rate in the last 2 years. On a run rate basis, organic growth was about 14% with escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributing about 7% to our international run rate growth, and organic new business commencements were an even larger component of the growth at about 8%. That growth was partially offset by some churn of less than 1%. 
There was broad strength across our international property segments with all 3 posting double-digit organic core revenue growth rates. Our Latin American organic core growth was over 13% including 10% and 13% in Mexico and Brazil, respectively, as network rollouts remained consistent throughout the region even with some macroeconomic challenges. In India, we generated organic core growth of over 12% as large incumbent Indian wireless operators continued to spend aggressively to support the deployment of new technologies and spectrum. And in our fastest-growing region, EMEA, organic core growth was over 14% or 18% excluding our more mature German market. These strong growth rates continue to highlight the benefits of our diversification across countries, customers and technologies. 
On a global basis there are nearly 2.5 billion people in the markets that we serve and our largest customers will be investing tens of billions of dollars in those markets just this year to meet their customers' rapidly growing wireless needs. 
Complementing our organic growth on a consolidated basis were contributions from more than 25,000 sites built, leased and acquired since the beginning of last year including the Verizon, Airtel and TIM portfolios as well as the roughly 3,700 sites we built ourselves. Collectively, these new assets contributed over 16% to our core growth rate in the quarter and we're especially encouraged by the performance of our Nigerian assets, which have so far exceeded our expectations for new business. Of the 3,700 new build sites, about 500 were completed this quarter, generating average day 1 NOI yields of over 10%. In addition, we also built 14 new indoor DAS or small cell networks in the quarter, many in our international markets. Within the U.S., where the indoor networks have been in place the longest, our tenants per node stands at approximately 2.3, driving gross margins in the 70% to 75% range. Our return on these investments is about 15%. Including those of Viom, we now have over 700 indoor DAS venues globally. 
Moving on to Slide 8. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Our gross margin excluding pass-through remained above 80% despite the impact of the additional 25,000 new lower-tenancy, lower-margin sites we brought into our portfolio over the last year. This was the result of our strong organic gross margin conversion ratio of roughly 90%. We've been generating these types of conversion ratios for several years now. Adjusting for the impact of our recent acquisitions, this gross margin would have expanded to about 83%. 
Our land acquisition and extension team also made significant progress towards driving incremental NPV for the portfolio while enhancing our long-term U.S. gross margin and preserving future cash flows affecting more than 700 land leases this quarter by either acquiring them outright or extending them. About 50% of these transactions related to the Verizon portfolio. And as a result of our continued progress in this area over the last year, the percent of owned sites increased over 300 basis points in the U.S. from the prior year period to nearly 27% and the average remaining term of sites on leased land increased to nearly 24 years. 
In addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased about 20 basis points year-over-year after excluding the impact of the lower-margin, lower-tenancy acquired sites. 
Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined about 30 basis points year-over-year to about 8.4%. 
Our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth in the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% or about 24% on a core basis to approximately $833 million as a result of our top line growth, coupled with diligent operational expense management. A strong adjusted EBITDA-to-AFFO conversion ratio of over 81% as well as some lower cash taxes and cash interest and capital improvement CapEx relative to our internal expectations led to AFFO growth of over 17%. On a core basis, AFFO growth was about 25% and AFFO per share grew by about 13% to $1.41 per share.
As a result of our solid first quarter performance and improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016 as detailed on Slide 10. At the midpoint of our outlook, we are raising our expectations for property revenue by $40 million or nearly 1%, resulting in projected growth of about 21% on both a reported and core basis. The increase is being driven primarily by $50 million in FX assumption favorability as compared to our prior outlook, partially offset by approximately $40 million associated with the delay in closing the Viom acquisition versus prior expectations. As you recall, we closed the Viom transaction on April 21 versus an expected April 1 closing. 
In addition, we expect a $20 million increase in past due revenue and around $9 million in incremental straight-line revenues. 
Within our total revenue projections, we are reiterating our organic growth outlook for our U.S. and international businesses. We continue to expect mid-5% organic core growth for our U.S. property segment, given consistent activity levels that have been in line with the expectations we discussed in late February. As we have touched on previously, there are a few items impacting this rate in 2016 versus 2015 including more evenly distributed new business versus it being more front end-loaded last year and flat decommissioning revenue, which are being partially offset by lower churn expectations as compared to 2015. 
On an ending run rate basis, as of December, growth for 2016 is expected to be closer to 6%. Internationally, organic growth is still expected to be nearly 12%. At a consolidated level, our expectation for total organic core growth remains unchanged at approximately 7% for the year or nearly 8% on a run rate organic growth basis. Newly acquired and built sites, which includes the impact of Viom, are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated core growth for the year or about 14%. 
Our outlook highlights the benefits of the increasing diversification of our revenue base and our decreasing dependence on any one country to deliver consistent and predictable growth. We're a vital provider of communications real estate in vibrant markets like Mexico where aggressive 4G rollouts are ramping up, in Brazil where significant 3G network augmentation is continuing and in India with the transition from 2G is only now getting underway for a majority of the population. This diversification supports our ability to generate consistent sustainable growth rates on a consolidated basis. 
Our improved revenue growth outlook and strong conversion rates are in turn expected to lead to a higher 2016 adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $25 million or nearly 1% at the midpoint. This reflects a negative $20 million impact due to the delayed Viom closing. This is being more than offset, however, by a $10 million increase in cash EBITDA projected from our existing business as a result of better cost performance as well as an expected $35 million benefit from improving foreign currency exchange forecast and incremental net straight-line impacts. 
As detailed on Slide 11, we are also raising our outlook for AFFO by $20 million at the midpoint or nearly 1% versus our prior outlook despite the negative $20 million impact of the delayed Viom close on cash adjusted EBITDA. The impact of the delay is being partially offset by a $10 million increase in expected legacy cash EBITDA; a $5 million decrease in the combination of cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures on an FX-neutral basis as well as a benefit of approximately $25 million resulting from the improvement in foreign currency forecast. As a result, assuming a weighted average diluted share count of 429 million shares, the midpoint of our outlook now implies an AFFO per share of $5.65, representing year-over-year per share growth of over 11%.
Turning to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we declared over $240 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed nearly $160 million in CapEx in Q1. We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions will create meaningful value for our stockholders. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our REIT distribution subject to board approval of at least 20%. 
We are also contributed to maintaining a substantial base of liquidity and a solid balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio stood at 5x net debt to annualized Q1 adjusted EBITDA, with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below, and longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3x and 5x. 
As a result of our consistent capital deployment strategy, we expect to extend our track record of delivering strong financial results in 2016 as is detailed on Slide 13 and even more importantly are positioning ourselves for strong sustainable growth going forward. In fact, at the midpoint of our outlook, we will have grown property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO at a mid-teen percentage clip since 2007 while at the same time maintaining return on invested capital of between 9% and 10% despite adding over 25,000 new sites since the beginning of 2015. We expect these new sites will enhance our future growth trajectory over the long term while enhancing total returns.
Turning to Slide 14 and in summary. We started 2016 with a strong operational quarter, announced our entry into Tanzania, built nearly 500 sites and closed our acquisition of a controlling stake in Viom Networks just last week. Our top priority remains driving continued operational excellence while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to sustain strong growth in all of our key metrics and margin performance and are raising our 2016 outlook for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Similar to last year, we expect core growth in all 3 to be above our long-term targets. By year-end, we expect to have nearly 150,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and leverage back within our target range. 
Due to our disciplined, consistent global capital allocation program, we continued to generate strong organic core revenue growth supported by a high-quality asset base diversified across geographies, carriers and network technologies with a global portfolio more than triple the size of our closest U.S. publicly traded peers. Our significant exposure to high-growth markets and our carefully cultivated asset base positions us to not only benefit from significant near-term network investments, but to also deliver strong and steady growth over the long term. As a result, we expect to continue to generate consistent, recurring growth in AFFO per share and a highly compelling total returns to stockholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

The first quarter results we've just reported today again demonstrate continued solid demand for tower space both in the U.S. and in our diversified international markets. In the United States, cons",1202,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. The first quarter results we've just reported today again demonstrate continued solid demand for tower space both in the U.S. and in our diversified international markets. 
In the United States, consumers' ever-increasing appetite for mobile bandwidth has supported cumulative wireless carrier CapEx of nearly $180 billion over just the last 5 years with approximately another $95 billion in spectrum auction spending as well. The deployment of 4G technology at higher spectrum bands has driven significant colocation during this period due to the need for a more dense network array. In addition, each new spectrum band acquired and deployed into the network has driven additional amendment activity in the form of more antennas and remote radio heads on our towers. In the United States, the 4 major wireless carriers are at or close to the completion of their Phase 1 coverage deployment of 4G technology. 
So what does this mean for the level of demand for tower space going forward domestically? The primary message of my remarks today is that we expect demand for macro tower space to remain robust as mobile operators progress through their subsequent deployment phases for 4G and then on to 5G deployments thereafter. Our conclusions are based on a combination of internal and external analyses that we have conducted over the past 2 years. 
Now in the past, you've heard us describe many of the technical and economic factors that support the continued use of towers as the optimal siting solution for mobile transmitters especially in suburban and rural environments and along transportation corridors such as highways. Today, I'd like to focus the discussion at a much more personal level: the factors that drive a satisfying user experience on our mobile devices. 
Each of us is very familiar with these performance factors as we use our smartphones every day. These factors are, first, coverage; second, capacity; and third, and more importantly, as time goes on, peak speed. So coverage, capacity and peak speed. So let's say you're taking the Metro-North train for your commute from Rye to the Grand Central station, a ride of about 45 minutes or so. Along that route, most of your trip would be served by wireless transmission sites on macro towers including our towers in Harrison, the Mamaroneck and in the Bronx. While on the train, you want to watch cnn.com video clips or the day's news on your phone. Coverage would be represented by the number of signal bars you see at the upper left hand corner of your screen, and by the way, it's just coverage. Capacity, meanwhile, would determine how many people on the train could watch streaming video at the same time as you. If capacity is insufficient, even if the coverage bars are there, then many of the viewers will experience buffering, they'll start to see the spinning wheel that we all dread instead of the video we want to watch. And finally, peak speed will determine the quality of that video experience. Does it come across crisp? Or is it grainy, choppy and pretty much unwatchable? So coverage, capacity and speed all need to be there to give you a good user experience. 
Based on the level of investment by your particular wireless service provider, your experience could vary drastically on each of these dimensions as you progress along your commute. We're now at the stage where most U.S. wireless carriers have deployed the majority of their 4G coverage sites. So in practice, the vast majority of us, U.S. mobile subscribers, have access to 4G bars when we look at our phone. 
The anticipated 6x increase in mobile traffic from 2015 to 2020, however, can't just be solved through these Phase 1 coverage sites. Wireless carriers are continuing to make significant investments in their networks to increase capacity across most of their sites including in suburban and rural areas and also along those transportation corridors. This capacity augmentation happens in 2 ways. First, carriers can add new spectrum bands, often resulting in amendments on our sites to new or larger multi-frequency antennas. We're seeing this with bands such as AWS-3, WCS and 2.5 gigahertz already. And second, wireless carriers are actively refarming 2G and 3G spectrum into 4G to gain better spectral efficiency across all of their spectrum. This is currently being implemented across the cellular 800 megahertz band by some carriers as well as PCS bands and also drives amendments on our towers as older antennas are typically swapped out for larger, more advanced antennas when the refarming of spectrum occurs. 
In addition to their focus on coverage and capacity, you've been seeing in their advertisements that carriers have also now started to shift their marketing towards an emphasis on peak speeds. This shift drives further investment into cell sites through technologies such as carrier aggregation as well as adding new cell sites to reduce the transmission radius and therefore the quality improvement for each signal. This increase in cell site density is expected to drive incremental colocation opportunities on macro towers as customers like us demand higher and higher peak speeds to enhance our user experience. 
All this points to not only significant continuing 4G LTE investments, but also to the subsequent deployment of 5G, which is not expected to be widely available until at least the 2020 time frame, though some free standard or trial deployments are possible over the intervening next few years. 
So similar to 3G and 4G deployments in the past, 5G is likely to start in those dense urban environments in which capacity and signal strength challenges are the greatest and then spread to suburban rural locations over time. While very high-frequency bands of spectrum such as millimeter wave might be effective for 5G in dense urban mobile environments and maybe as a fiber-to-home substitute, it's our view that lower-band spectrum will continue to be used for mobile 5G service in suburban and rural areas where our towers are located given the need for broader coverage and a less acute requirement for point capacity. 
Coincidentally, the 600-megahertz spectrum currently being auctioned should be cleared in the same general 2020 time frame as the commencement of large scale 5G deployments. The newly available 600-megahertz spectrum could be used for 5G rollouts outside of dense urban locations without disrupting 4G spectrum bands already in use or causing significant interference. 
As a result, carriers would once again need to install additional or larger multi-band antennas on towers, which we would expect to result in incremental revenue growth for us. Even if that more than 80% of the U.S. population resides outside of urban areas, we view this as a long-term opportunity for our 5G portfolio -- for our portfolio as 5G gets implemented down the road. 
So to summarize. Even in a 5G world, we believe that macro towers will continue to be a foundational building block for mobile network deployments in the U.S. and globally. Consequently, we are confident that demand for tower space will continue to remain robust for many years to come. 
So thanks again for joining us this morning, and Tony, you can open the line for questions now."

The kind of the run rate metric that Leah talked about in her opening remarks is a new metric that we're adding. We talked about it last time we were together, but it isolates just kind of the recurring leased space run rate revenue that we generate on an FX-neutral basis and we think it provides more transparency into the components, which really drive the tenant run rate growth. And so that's what is driving the 5.9%. So it excludes decommissioning revenues and those types of things back billing, amortization revenue, those types of things and we think it gives more clarity in terms of what really is the run rate growth in the business. The 5.5% is our traditional core organic growth, which is the one that we've historically talked about, which represents the kind of the same-tower store growth on those assets that we've owned for at least 12 months. And so that's what's really driving the difference between the 2 metrics. And on the Viom piece, in 2016, we now expect to generate about $555 million of revenue from Viom, about $245 million in gross margin contribution, I think around $215 million in EBITDA and that represents the closing as of the April 21. Going forward, over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll look to merge our existing legacy business, which is our 15,000 sites that we have within ATC India that generates a couple of hundred million dollars a year, with the Viom business. And then, over time -- and that will take our ownership interests up from the current 51% to the mid-60s. And then, following that period of time, we'll look at whether or how -- financially what makes sense in terms of bringing the rest of the business in . I mean, it's our objective that we would want to own 100% of the business. We have some very strong partners within the business including the Tatas and Macquarie and so we're really excited about controlling the business, running the business with that kind of participation. So I would expect over the next 3 to 4 years we'll have more clarity in terms of just what we ultimately end up with from an ownership perspective of the business. But our immediate goal is to merge the 2 business where then we can really start to recognize what we believe in some synergies."

First of all, the overall CapEx from year-to-year in the U.S. wireless industry is expected to be flat around $30 billion. So if there are moderated ups and downs among individual carriers, the total is looking to be about the same, which means our aggregate new business opportunity among the major tower operators ought to look similar from 2015 to 2016. That's how we've introduced our guidance and then formed our guidance. And at the end of the day, we're looking more at the overall markets now especially with the segment reporting we've moved to. And so the U.S. run rate leasing metric that Tom talked about is we expect 6% or so in the United States, which is very solid. The other thing I'd like to say about the run rate metric, we're giving you yet another lens to look at the business. I think it's a good lens because it actually -- it's very similar to the way a lot of real estate investors look at the assets, which is what are your rent increases and rent pricing over time and what's your occupancy increases over time and that really just encapsulates all of that in the run rate and it takes out some of these amortized contributions and other onetime settlements and things like that, that cause you to have to pull them apart to figure out what the real run rate is. So we're just going to give that to you. So when you take the U.S. 6% run rate and then you know the other part of our strategy is diversification across carriers, technologies, continents, et cetera, and our international run rate leasing is 14% this year, so the weighted average is about 8% and this is what we're trying to preserve over many, many years, which is a weighted average, smooth, rising curve of revenue growth, which then drives the double-digit expectation and objective we have for AFFO per share growth. So individual carriers in the U.S. are really important, but we're looking at more the market level now. And when you look at the aggregates, we still got $30 billion of spending and 6% of run rate growth in the domestic business. And then the last thing I'll say, and Tom referred to it a couple of times, is we're really starting to focus on efficiency especially in the domestic business to get costs out of it, performance to be at or above as far as revenue and top line growth and that's going to help us with the AFFO per share contribution from the U.S. over time as well. So I really think it's important if you want to understand the carriers' individual plans to refer to their public statements specifically or talk to them individually. But we're really going to be looking at market level and regional level trends from this point on."

So Jonathan, I think you know we don't speak to individual contract negotiations or even outcomes with the mobile operators really anywhere. We've described that we have offered holistic-type agreements when mobile operators are in server ramp-up or a high-spend mode and that just helps them in a couple of ways: one is to budget more accurately and understand what their costs will be going forward; and secondly, it reduces the cycle times and therefore increases the surety of when their deployments will be implemented as far as the schedule perspective. So those benefits are still there. Some of the mobile operators are taking advantage of those now. Some of them have decided to either stay on or move toward or away from a more retail type of operation. So without specifying any of those, those are the range of options. And carriers move among those options based on their investment cycle, which, again, speaks to the benefit of diversification when you can do those multiple-type contracts. So secondly, on the in-building side, I would like to think we are a bit of a pioneer in a way, especially in Latin America, to introduce this technology. It'll come into EMEA and especially Africa next on our part. But Mexico and Brazil have been really strong for us on in-building, and Viom, to its credit, is more of a pioneer in, in-building in the India market with a couple of hundred venues much more actually than we even have. So it's actually a very good match on the small cell side as well, Viom and ATC India. But those are probably the 3 places with the most opportunity right now, Mexico, Brazil and India."

What's happening in Mexico right now is something that, again, has happened in the U.S. and other markets earlier and that is the rate of 4G adoption can be sort of governed, if you will, by 2 things in any market: one is service pricing and the other one is handset pricing. So the lower the handset pricing or the lower the service pricing, the more people can afford it, will sign up and start using it and grow over time in their usage. So in Mexico, the government successfully increased the level of competition in that country. Service pricing moved in a constructive way for the population to be able to adopt data services more rapidly than they could before. And globally, handset pricing for 4G is also reducing at the same time. So you have these 2 complementary cost unit reductions in handsets and service pricing and people in Mexico are signing up. So that then, as we've always seen in every other case, increased smartphone penetration, 3G usage and ultimately 4G, drives gigabits per month on the network and that network demand needs to be serviced in large part often by adding equipment to real estate including towers. It's the typical cycle we've seen, but I'd say the 2 drivers are reduced handset pricing and reduced service pricing for data."

So historically, we've thought of escalators as being something north of 3% for your business, particularly in the United States. But escalators, as we all know, is supposed to be tied to inflation. That's essentially the whole purpose of why they are designed. And inflation, as we all know, both when we look backwards as well as, I think, when we look forward is much less than that right now. And I'm curious if because of that, you're starting to see some pushback on the escalators on new deals you're signing in the United States, and if you're still able to achieve that 3-plus percent or is it actually now something closer to, for example, 2%. And then my second question just goes back to some of the comments Jim made talking about the U.S. market. I think one of the things that's going to be different with the build-out of 5G relative to previous generational builds is the use of outdoor small cells. And it looks like from a topology perspective, particularly when you think of some of the higher-band frequencies that are going to be used, small cells are going to command a greater portion of the overall investment dollars for network build-outs than has historically happened. And I'm curious if you think that, that's going to limit the level of macro tower growth you're going to see in the United States tied to 5G versus the growth rate we've seen in previous generational build-outs?"

So of course, there's an inflation kind of concept second order behind that, but land rent costs are the largest costs of ongoing tower operations and ground lessors have been able to secure 3-plus percent escalators off on ground leases. So those are mirrored in the tower lease. Moving to the outdoor -- small cell 5G issue, I would invite you to get a hold of Leah separately because we've got some pretty in-depth technical assessments on how this works whether it's a 3G, 4G or 5G. And yes, in dense urban networks -- dense urban environments, networks do have to have much shorter transmission radii. Small cells make sense for them for 3G, 4G and ultimately it makes sense for 5G. But what we serve is the suburban rural and transportation corridor market, not urban or dense urban. 97.5% of our towers are in nondense urban environments and the reason that carriers use towers predominantly in those environments because that is the optimal height, power setting and transmission radius for suburban rural and transportation corridor use cases. The proportion of small cell spending, our projection is that, yes, percentage of CapEx will double over the next 5 years from 5% to approximately 10%. That's our estimate. Therefore, we think 90% of the spend rate or so is going to continue to be on macro sites, mainly towers and also rooftops in more urban environments. So that's how we sort of see it going forward again. If you want more depth in some of the detail, we can even provide a separate session for anybody that wants that. Just contact Leah."

The most important part of the integration from a commercial standpoint is when sales force face to the customer which is in the process of being implemented right now and that's on a fast-track. The second largest piece from, again, a customer and revenue point of view will be the integration of multiple master lease agreements between the 2 portfolios among many customers. That's going to take probably 12 to 18 months to really get those consolidated, but those things have already started. As far as the leasability of the sites, Viom has been run as an independent third-party tower company already and therefore the documentation, the systems, the data to be able to quickly lease sites is largely already there. That's a difference than, say, a carrier portfolio like Verizon where you have to at least collect a lot of that from field offices and such. So the Viom integration from an effective leasability standpoint is going to be, I think, on a very fast-track. This will be -- this entire portfolio, this combined portfolio, is going to be jointly marketed to our customer base early on and we're already in volume discussions with many of them as to how they can take advantage of the now #1 independent tower company in India, along with our traditional sort of operating capabilities that they've come to sort of respect. So I say the Viom integration was 12 to 18 months to get it completely renegotiated around the master contracts and then have some of the fieldwork done and some of the organizational alignments fully completed. As to Verizon, we've said just recently in our last call is still the case. We have a 9% to 10% long-term sort of cumulative average growth rate expectation over 10 years for that portfolio and we still do. So every month or 2, it's not going to change, I can imagine, materially. We're seeing new business on the sites. They're in really great shape as far as the carrier portfolio for capacity ground space, the documentation I referred to earlier. So we're progressing through our plan and expect to be able to deliver what we've stated in the past."

Even before we get the 5G, one of the things that's happening now, and this is something Verizon discussed when it met with analysts earlier this week, is that carriers are moving to a centralized RAN design. So they're taking some of the equipment that had historically been at tower locations and moving them to central locations. However, Verizon also said that, in many cases, those central locations are other macro sites. And so since this is happening now and I imagine you're seeing some of it going on at your sites, how does this affect your business? I mean are you seeing some reduction of footprints in other one someplace, but meaningful increases in the carrier footprint in other locations? And on net, what does this mean for you?"

There are some offsets, like you said, but generally, the way our contracts are structured, the vast majority of the lease rate, if you will, and none of it is separable or separable, if you will, but the vast majority of the pricing calculation is really what goes on the tower, not necessarily on the ground. Again, not of it's severable. So because you took one sort of cabinet off of your ground space, you're still paying for the square foot footprint of that ground space and you can put whatever you want on it. So we don't intend to reduce prices because someone moved a cabinet from one place to another and took it off the site. One of the benefits of central RAN or cloud RAN in our view is that it frees up more resources for the radio access network, the transmission equipment that goes up on the tower, which again we charge for and that's most of the amendments have to deal with. So over the long term, we think RAN centralization or cloud RAN is going to be constructive for our lease growth on our sites because it's much less, and I think a couple of mobile operators have said this is reducing their core network costs fairly significantly, that more resources could then be potentially devoted to the radio access network, which, again, 90% of that we think will be spent on tower and related rooftop sites."

But again, our sites tend to have substantial ground space. What's been helpful, for example, is when, say, Nextel went from having essentially a tractor-trailer full of equipment on the site down to today's Sprint 2 cabinets and a much smaller footprint. The miniaturization of the base station electronics has actually helped us free up more ground space over time. Now there are cases when we need to get more because we have multiple customers now, which is great. But yes, I think that we're going to be in good shape to be able to host not only sort of extra cloud RAN equipment on-site, which are closer to the edge of the network, but also distributed -- someday we think there could be an opportunity for distributed storage, caching especially entertainment-type volumes of data at the tower site to reduce the latency of transmission of content. That's something down the road that our ground space can be useful and we have some examples in our international markets where we're doing fiber ducts and other sort of very closely related ancillary uses of the ground space for incremental amendment. So we'll get every dollar we can out of every square foot of ground we can, but I think it's a little bit of a long cycle again kind of therapeutic trend."

And then perhaps the biggest factor in any of these deals, whether it's in Asia, the U.S. or Europe or elsewhere, is the asset pricing at that moment versus the expected revenue and EBITDA growth rates through the medium and long term. And when there's a dislocation between asset pricing and those long-term prospects, you do not see us that. Any major investment for us, especially given the scale we're at today and diversification we have today, actually, Simon, needs to enhance the expected performance of our existing asset portfolio. So something we do on top of the transactions and organic growth we've already done has to make the whole cash flow curve better over time. And so those deals are difficult to find especially when you impart the discipline and patients that are the hallmarks of our investment committee, which is, me, Tom and our General Counsel, Ed here. So it's a disciplined process. And this is one example not to try to make any kind of prediction for any other region, but you'll recall that we entered the India market in 2007. We kind of deliberately built the business a piece at a time of increasing size over a 9-year period before securing the leading position in the market with Viom. So if that's what it takes, that's what we'll do. On the other hand, if opportunities emerge quickly like in Nigeria, there were 3 trades and within sort of 9 to 12 months, we were very active in those as well. So it's hard to predict. The environment -- the M&A environment is not just by the seller, but also by the buyer community. And if asset prices are too high, you're not going to see us that active. If asset prices are within our investment criteria, you'll see us move very quickly to move forward. So really not much specific to say that we're out there, we're active and we still use the same process in asset pricing reporting to us."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining American Tower's first quarter earnings conference call. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the first quarter 2016 as well as our full year 2016 outlook. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on the U.S. mobile market and our strategy. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations regarding future growth including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; anticipated closing of signed acquisitions and the impact of recently closed acquisitions, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in the other filings we make with the SEC. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. In addition, on our IR website, you will also find our quarterly supplemental package, which includes expanded disclosure on the components of our revenue and revenue growth including historical trending of our run rate revenue, which reflects revenue associated with tenant leases that are typically 
non-cancelable and include renewal options as well as annual escalation provisions. We believe this disclosure will provide investors with greater visibility into the key drivers of our revenue model and a simple baseline on which to model our business. 
Accordingly, we have introduced a new metric to track the currency-neutral growth of the organic component of our run-rate revenue, which we will refer to as property revenue run-rate organic growth. 
To the extent you have any questions on the new disclosures, please don't hesitate to reach out to myself or another member of our Investor Relations team. 
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, our property revenue grew over 19% to nearly $1.27 billion. Total revenues grew over 19% to nearly $1.29 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% to approximately $833 million. Adjusted funds from operations increased by over 17% to approximately $602 million. And net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 35% to $248 million or $0.58 per diluted common share. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
24766,330366940,968063,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had a strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first",2231,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had a strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.51 per share, which was up over 21% from the prior year period. And just last week, we closed our previously announced Viom transaction in India. Our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate Viom's more than 42,000 towers into our portfolio. This transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share and we expect it will help us continue to deliver strong growth across our key financial metrics. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we drove strong growth in all of our key metrics in the first quarter, all in the 23% to 25% range on a core basis. Our total property revenue core growth of about 25% included consolidated organic core growth of nearly 9% or over 8% on an organic run-rate basis, which excludes the impact of decommissioning revenues. This strong revenue growth, combined with our disciplined expense management, led to double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share.
Turning to Slide 7. Our U.S. segment generated organic core growth for the quarter of about 7.1% which includes the positive impact of $31 million of decommissioning revenue as compared to approximately $17 million recorded in Q1 of last year. On a run-rate basis, again which excludes the decommissioning revenues, U.S. organic growth was in line with our expectations at about 5.9%. Our international markets generated organic growth over 600 basis points higher than the U.S. and over 350 basis points higher than it generated in Q1 of 2015 at over 13% on a consolidated basis, the highest rate in the last 2 years. On a run-rate basis, organic growth was about 14% with escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributing about 7% to our international run-rate growth, and organic new business commencements were an even larger component of the growth at about 8%. That growth was partially offset by some churn of less than 1%. 
There was broad strength across our international property segments with all 3 posting double-digit organic core revenue growth rates. Our Latin American organic core growth was over 13% including 10% and 13% in Mexico and Brazil, respectively, as network rollouts remained consistent throughout the region even with some macroeconomic challenges. In India, we generated organic core growth of over 12% as large incumbent Indian wireless operators continued to spend aggressively to support the deployment of new technologies and spectrum. And in our fastest-growing region, EMEA, organic core growth was over 14% or 18% excluding our more mature German market. These strong growth rates continue to highlight the benefits of our diversification across countries, customers and technologies. 
On a global basis there are nearly 2.5 billion people in the markets that we serve and our largest customers will be investing tens of billions of dollars in those markets just this year to meet their customers' rapidly growing wireless needs. 
Complementing our organic growth on a consolidated basis were contributions from more than 25,000 sites built, leased and acquired since the beginning of last year including the Verizon, Airtel and TIM portfolios as well as the roughly 3,700 sites we built ourselves. Collectively, these new assets contributed over 16% to our core growth rate in the quarter and we're especially encouraged by the performance of our Nigerian assets, which have so far exceeded our expectations for new business. Of the 3,700 newbuild sites, about 500 were completed this quarter, generating average day 1 NOI yields of over 10%. In addition, we also built 14 new indoor DAS or small cell networks in the quarter, many in our international markets. Within the U.S., where the indoor networks have been in place the longest, our tenants per node stands at approximately 2.3, driving gross margins in the 70% to 75% range. Our return on these investments is about 15%. Including those of Viom, we now have over 700 indoor DAS venues globally. 
Moving on to Slide 8. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Our gross margin excluding pass-through remained above 80% despite the impact of the additional 25,000 new lower-tenancy, lower-margin sites we brought into our portfolio over the last year. This was the result of our strong organic gross margin conversion ratio of roughly 90%. We've been generating these types of conversion ratios for several years now. Adjusting for the impact of our recent acquisitions, this gross margin would have expanded to about 83%. 
Our land acquisition and extension team also made significant progress towards driving incremental NPV for the portfolio while enhancing our long-term U.S. gross margin and preserving future cash flows affecting more than 700 land leases this quarter by either acquiring them outright or extending them. About 50% of these transactions related to the Verizon portfolio. And as a result of our continued progress in this area over the last year, the percent of owned sites increased over 300 basis points in the U.S. from the prior year period to nearly 27% and the average remaining term of sites on leased land increased to nearly 24 years. 
In addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased about 20 basis points year-over-year after excluding the impact of the lower-margin, lower-tenancy acquired sites. 
Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined about 30 basis points year-over-year to about 8.4%. 
Our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth in the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% or about 24% on a core basis to approximately $833 million as a result of our top line growth, coupled with diligent operational expense management. A strong adjusted EBITDA-to-AFFO conversion ratio of over 81%, as well as some lower cash taxes and cash interest and capital improvement CapEx relative to our internal expectations, led to AFFO growth of over 17%. On a core basis, AFFO growth was about 25% and AFFO per share grew by about 13% to $1.41 per share.
As a result of our solid first quarter performance and improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecasts, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016 as detailed on Slide 10. At the midpoint of our outlook, we are raising our expectations for property revenue by $40 million or nearly 1%, resulting in projected growth of about 21% on both a reported and core basis. The increase is being driven primarily by $50 million in FX assumption favorability as compared to our prior outlook, partially offset by approximately $40 million associated with the delay in closing the Viom acquisition versus prior expectations. As you recall, we closed the Viom transaction on April 21 versus an expected April 1 closing. 
In addition, we expect a $20 million increase in pass-through revenue and around $9 million in incremental straight-line revenues. 
Within our total revenue projections, we are reiterating our organic growth outlook for our U.S. and international businesses. We continue to expect mid-5% organic core growth for our U.S. property segment, given consistent activity levels that have been in line with the expectations we discussed in late February. As we have touched on previously, there are a few items impacting this rate in 2016 versus 2015, including more evenly distributed new business versus it being more front end-loaded last year and flat decommissioning revenue, which are being partially offset by lower churn expectations as compared to 2015. 
On an ending run rate basis, as of December, growth for 2016 is expected to be closer to 6%. Internationally, organic growth is still expected to be nearly 12%. At a consolidated level, our expectation for total organic core growth remains unchanged at approximately 7% for the year or nearly 8% on a run rate organic growth basis. Newly acquired and built sites, which includes the impact of Viom, are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated core growth for the year or about 14%. 
Our outlook highlights the benefits of the increasing diversification of our revenue base and our decreasing dependence on any one country to deliver consistent and predictable growth. We're a vital provider of communications real estate in vibrant markets like Mexico where aggressive 4G rollouts are ramping up, in Brazil where significant 3G network augmentation is continuing and in India where the transition from 2G is only now getting underway for a majority of the population. This diversification supports our ability to generate consistent sustainable growth rates on a consolidated basis. 
Our improved revenue growth outlook and strong conversion rates are in turn expected to lead to a higher 2016 adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $25 million or nearly 1% at the midpoint. This reflects a negative $20 million impact due to the delayed Viom closing. This is being more than offset, however, by a $10 million increase in cash EBITDA projected from our existing business as a result of better cost performance as well as an expected $35 million benefit from improving foreign currency exchange forecasts and incremental net straight-line impacts. 
As detailed on Slide 11, we are also raising our outlook for AFFO by $20 million at the midpoint or nearly 1% versus our prior outlook despite the negative $20 million impact of the delayed Viom close on cash adjusted EBITDA. The impact of the delay is being partially offset by a $10 million increase in expected legacy cash EBITDA; a $5 million decrease in the combination of cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures on an FX-neutral basis, as well as a benefit of approximately $25 million resulting from the improvement in foreign currency forecasts. As a result, assuming a weighted average diluted share count of 429 million shares, the midpoint of our outlook now implies an AFFO per share of $5.65, representing year-over-year per share growth of over 11%.
Turning to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we declared over $240 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed nearly $160 million in CapEx in Q1. We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions will create meaningful value for our stockholders. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our REIT distribution subject to board approval of at least 20%. 
We are also committed to maintaining a substantial base of liquidity and a solid balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio stood at 5x net debt to annualized Q1 adjusted EBITDA, with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below, and longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3x and 5x. 
As a result of our consistent capital deployment strategy, we expect to extend our track record of delivering strong financial results in 2016 as is detailed on Slide 13 and even more importantly are positioning ourselves for strong sustainable growth going forward. In fact, at the midpoint of our outlook, we will have grown property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO at a mid-teen percentage clip since 2007 while at the same time maintaining return on invested capital of between 9% and 10% despite adding over 25,000 new sites since the beginning of 2015. We expect these new sites will enhance our future growth trajectory over the long term while enhancing total returns.
Turning to Slide 14 and in summary. We started 2016 with a strong operational quarter, announced our entry into Tanzania, built nearly 500 sites and closed our acquisition of a controlling stake in Viom Networks just last week. Our top priority remains driving continued operational excellence while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to sustain strong growth in all of our key metrics and margin performance and are raising our 2016 outlook for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Similar to last year, we expect core growth in all 3 to be above our long-term targets. But by year-end, we expect to have nearly 150,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and leverage back within our target range. 
Due to our disciplined, consistent global capital allocation program, we continued to generate strong organic core revenue growth supported by a high-quality asset base diversified across geographies, carriers and network technologies with a global portfolio more than triple the size of our closest U.S. publicly traded peers. Our significant exposure to high-growth markets and our carefully cultivated asset base positions us to not only benefit from significant near-term network investments, but to also deliver strong and steady growth over the long term. As a result, we expect to continue to generate consistent, recurring growth in AFFO per share and a highly compelling total return to stockholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

The first quarter results we've just reported today again demonstrate continued solid demand for tower space both in the U.S. and in our diversified international markets. In the United States, cons",1200,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. The first quarter results we've just reported today again demonstrate continued solid demand for tower space both in the U.S. and in our diversified international markets. 
In the United States, consumers' ever-increasing appetite for mobile bandwidth has supported cumulative wireless carrier CapEx of nearly $180 billion over just the last 5 years with approximately another $95 billion in spectrum auction spending as well. The deployment of 4G technology at higher spectrum bands has driven significant colocation during this period due to the need for a more dense network array. In addition, each new spectrum band acquired and deployed into the network has driven additional amendment activity in the form of more antennas and remote radio heads on our towers. In the United States, the 4 major wireless carriers are at or close to the completion of their Phase 1 coverage deployment of 4G technology. 
So what does this mean for the level of demand for tower space going forward domestically? The primary message of my remarks today is that we expect demand for macro tower space to remain robust as mobile operators progress through their subsequent deployment phases for 4G and then on to 5G deployments, thereafter. Our conclusions are based on a combination of internal and external analyses that we have conducted over the past 2 years. 
Now in the past, you've heard us describe many of the technical and economic factors that support the continued use of towers as the optimal siting solution for mobile transmitters especially in suburban and rural environments and along transportation corridors such as highways. Today, I'd like to focus the discussion at a much more personal level: the factors that drive a satisfying user experience on our mobile devices. 
Each of us is very familiar with these performance factors as we use our smartphones every day. These factors are: first, coverage; second, capacity; and third, and more importantly as time goes on, peak speed. So coverage, capacity and peak speed. So let's say you're taking the Metro-North train for your commute from Rye to Grand Central Station, a ride of about 45 minutes or so. Along that route, most of your trip would be served by wireless transmission sites on macro towers including our towers in Harrison, Mamaroneck and in the Bronx. While on the train, you want to watch cnn.com video clips for the day's news on your phone. Coverage would be represented by the number of signal bars you see in the upper left hand corner of your screen, and by the way, it's just coverage. Capacity, meanwhile, would determine how many people on the train could watch streaming video at the same time as you. If capacity isn't sufficient, even if the coverage bars are there, then many of the viewers will experience buffering, they'll start to see the spinning wheel that we all dread instead of the video we want to watch. And finally, peak speed will determine the quality of that video experience. Does it come across crisp? Or is it grainy, choppy and pretty much unwatchable? So coverage, capacity and speed all need to be there to give you a good user experience. 
Based on the level of investment by your particular wireless service provider, your experience could vary drastically on each of these dimensions as you progress along your commute. We're now at the stage where most U.S. wireless carriers have deployed the majority of their 4G coverage sites. So in practice, the vast majority of us U.S. mobile subscribers have access to 4G bars when we look at our phone. 
The anticipated 6x increase in mobile traffic from 2015 to 2020, however, can't just be solved through these Phase 1 coverage sites. Wireless carriers are continuing to make significant investments in their networks to increase capacity across most of their sites including in suburban and rural areas and also along those transportation corridors. This capacity augmentation happens in 2 ways. First, carriers can add new spectrum bands, often resulting in amendments on our sites through new or larger multi-frequency antennas. We're seeing this with bands such as AWS-3, WCS and 2.5 gigahertz already. And second, wireless carriers are actively refarming 2G and 3G spectrum into 4G to gain better spectral efficiency across all of their spectrum. This is currently being implemented across the cellular 800 megahertz band by some carriers as well as PCS bands and also drives amendments on our towers as older antennas are typically swapped out for larger, more advanced antennas when the refarming of spectrum occurs. 
In addition to their focus on coverage and capacity, you've been seeing in their advertisements that carriers have also now started to shift their marketing towards an emphasis on peak speeds. This shift drives further investment into cell sites through technologies such as carrier aggregation as well as adding new cell sites to reduce the transmission radius and therefore the quality improvement for each signal. This increase in cell site density is expected to drive incremental colocation opportunities on macro towers as customers like us demand higher and higher peak speeds to enhance our user experience. 
All this points to not only significant continuing 4G LTE investments, but also to the subsequent deployment of 5G, which is not expected to be widely available until at least the 2020 time frame, though some free standard or trial deployments are possible over the intervening next few years. 
So similar to 3G and 4G deployments in the past, 5G is likely to start in those dense urban environments in which capacity and signal strength challenges are the greatest and then spread to suburban and rural locations over time. While very high-frequency bands of spectrum such as millimeter wave might be effective for 5G in dense urban mobile environments and maybe as a fiber-to-home substitute, it's our view that lower-band spectrum will continue to be used for mobile 5G service in suburban and rural areas where our towers are located given the need for broader coverage and a less acute requirement for point capacity. 
Coincidentally, the 600-megahertz spectrum currently being auctioned should be cleared in the same general 2020 time frame as the commencement of large scale 5G deployments. The newly available 600-megahertz spectrum could be used for 5G rollouts outside of dense urban locations without disrupting 4G spectrum bands already in use or causing significant interference. 
As a result, carriers would once again need to install additional or larger multi-band antennas on towers, which we would expect to result in incremental revenue growth for us. Even that more than 80% of the U.S. population resides outside of urban areas, we view this as a long-term opportunity for our 5G portfolio -- for our portfolio as 5G gets implemented down the road. 
So to summarize. Even in a 5G world, we believe that macro towers will continue to be a foundational building block for mobile network deployments in the U.S. and globally. Consequently, we are confident that demand for tower space will continue to remain robust for many years to come. 
So thanks again for joining us this morning, and Tony, you can open the line for questions now."

The kind of the run-rate metric that Leah talked about in her opening remarks is a new metric that we're adding. We talked about it last time we were together, but it isolates just kind of the recurring leased-base run-rate revenue that we generate on an FX-neutral basis and we think that provides more transparency into the components, which really drive the tenant run-rate growth. And so that's what is driving the 5.9%. So it excludes decommissioning revenues and those types of things, back billing, amortization revenue, those types of things. And we think it gives more clarity in terms of what really is the run-rate growth in the business. The 5.5% is our traditional core organic growth, which is the one that we've historically talked about, which represents the kind of the same-tower store growth on those assets that we've owned for at least 12 months. And so that's what's really driving the difference between the 2 metrics. And on the Viom piece, in 2016, we now expect to generate about $555 million of revenue from Viom, about $245 million in gross margin contribution, I think around $215 million in EBITDA and that represents the closing as of the April 21. Going forward, over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll look to merge our existing legacy business, which is our 15,000 sites that we have within ATC India, it generates a couple of hundred million dollars a year, with the Viom business. And then, over time -- and that will take our ownership interests up from the current 51% into the mid-60s. And then, following that period of time, we'll look at whether, how -- financially what makes sense in terms of bringing the rest of the business in. I mean, it's our objective that we would want to own 100% of the business. We have some very strong partners within the business including the Tatas and Macquarie and so we're really excited about controlling the business, running the business with that kind of participation. So I would expect over the next 3 to 4 years we'll have more clarity in terms of just what we ultimately end up with from an ownership perspective of the business. But our immediate goal is to merge the 2 businesses where, then, we can really start to recognize what we believe in some synergies."

First of all, the overall CapEx from year-to-year in the U.S. wireless industry is expected to be flat around $30 billion. So if there are moderated ups and downs among individual carriers, the total is looking to be about the same, which means our aggregate new business opportunity among the major tower operators ought to look similar from 2015 to 2016. That's how we've introduced our guidance and informed our guidance. And at the end of the day, we're looking more at the overall markets now especially with the segment reporting we've moved to. And so the U.S. run rate leasing metric that Tom talked about is we expect 6% or so in the United States, which is very solid. The other thing I'd like to say about the run-rate metric, we're giving you yet another lens to look at the business. I think it's a good lens because it actually -- it's very similar to the way a lot of real estate investors look at the assets, which is what are your rent increases and rent pricing over time and what's your occupancy increases over time and that really just encapsulates all of that in the run rate and it takes out some of these amortized contributions and other onetime settlements and things like that, that cause you to have to pull them apart to figure out what the real run rate is. So we're just going to give that to you. So when you take the U.S. 6% run rate and then you know the other part of our strategy is diversification across carriers, technologies, continents, et cetera, and our international run-rate leasing is 14% this year, so the weighted average is about 8% and this is what we're trying to preserve over many, many years, which is a weighted average, smooth, rising curve of revenue growth, which then drives the double-digit expectation and objective we have for AFFO per share growth. So individual carriers in the U.S. are really important, but we're looking at more the market level now. And when you look at the aggregates, we've still got $30 billion of spending and 6% of run-rate growth in the domestic business. And then the last thing I'll say, and Tom referred to it a couple of times, is we're really starting to focus on efficiency especially in the domestic business to get costs out of it, performance to be at or above, as far as revenue and top line growth, and that's going to help us with the AFFO per share contribution from the U.S. over time as well. So I really think it's important if you want to understand the carriers' individual plans to refer to their public statements specifically or talk to them individually. But we're really going to be looking at market-level and region-level trends from this point on."

So Jonathan, I think you know we don't speak to individual contract negotiations or even outcomes with the mobile operators really anywhere. We've described that we have offered holistic-type agreements when mobile operators are in sort of a ramp-up or a high-spend mode. And that just helps them in a couple of ways: one is to budget more accurately and understand what their costs will be going forward; and secondly, it reduces the cycle times and therefore increases the surety of when their deployments will be implemented as far as the schedule perspective. So those benefits are still there. Some of the mobile operators are taking advantage of those now. Some of them have decided to either stay on or move toward or away from a more retail type of operation. So without specifying any of those, those are the range of options. And carriers move among those options based on their investment cycle, which, again, speaks to the benefit of diversification when you can do those multiple-type contracts. So secondly, on the in-building side, I would like to think we are a bit of a pioneer in a way, especially in Latin America, to introduce this technology. It'll come into EMEA and especially Africa next on our part. But Mexico and Brazil have been really strong for us on in-building, and Viom, to its credit, is more of a pioneer in in-building in the India market with a couple of hundred venues, much more actually than we even have. So it's actually a very good match on the small cell side as well, Viom and ATC India. But those are probably the 3 places with the most opportunity right now, Mexico, Brazil and India."

What's happening in Mexico right now is something that, again, has happened in the U.S. and other markets earlier and that is the rate of 4G adoption can be sort of governed, if you will, by 2 things in any market: one is service pricing and the other one is handset pricing. So the lower the handset pricing and the lower the service pricing, the more people can afford it and will sign up and start using it and grow over time in their usage. So in Mexico, the government successfully increased the level of competition in that country. Service pricing moved in a constructive way for the population to be able to adopt data services more rapidly than they could before. And globally, handset pricing for 4G is also reducing at the same time. So you have these 2 complementary cost unit reductions in handsets and service pricing and people in Mexico are signing up. So that then, as we've always seen in every other case, increased smartphone penetration, 3G usage and ultimately 4G, drives gigabits per month on the network and that network demand needs to be serviced in large part often by adding equipment to real estate including towers. It's the typical cycle we've seen, but I'd say the 2 drivers are reduced handset pricing and reduced service pricing for data."

So historically, we've thought of escalators as being something north of 3% for your business, particularly in the United States. But escalators, as we all know, is supposed to be tied to inflation. That's essentially the whole purpose of why they were designed. And inflation, as we all know, both when we look backwards as well as, I think, when we look forward is much less than that right now. And I'm curious if because of that, you're starting to see some pushback on the escalators on new deals you're signing in the United States, and if you're still able to achieve the 3-plus percent or is it actually now something closer to, for example, 2%. And then my second question just goes back to some of the comments Jim made talking about the U.S. market. I think one of the things that's going to be different with the build-out of 5G relative to previous generational builds is the use of outdoor small cells. And it looks like from a topology perspective, particularly when you think of some of the higher-band frequencies that are going to be used, small cells are going to command a greater portion of the overall investment dollars for network build-outs than has historically happened. And I'm curious if you think that, that's going to limit the level of macro tower growth you're going to see in the United States tied to 5G versus the growth rates we've seen in previous generational build-outs?"

So of course, there's an inflation kind of concept, second order, behind that, but land rent costs are the largest costs of ongoing tower operations and ground lessors have been able to secure 3-plus percent escalators, often, on ground leases. So those are mirrored in the tower lease. Moving to the outdoor small cell 5G issue, I would invite you to get a hold of Leah separately because we've got some pretty in-depth technical assessments on how this works whether it's a 3G, 4G or 5G. And yes, in dense urban networks -- dense urban environments, networks do have to have much shorter transmission radii. Small cells make sense for them for 3G, 4G and, ultimately, they will make sense for 5G. But what we serve is the suburban rural and transportation corridor market, not urban or dense urban. 97.5% of our towers are in non-dense urban environments and the reason that carriers use towers predominantly in those environments because that is the optimal height, power setting and transmission radius for suburban rural and transportation corridor use cases. The proportion of small cell spending, our projection is that, yes, as a percentage of CapEx, it will double over the next 5 years from 5% to approximately 10%. That's our estimate. Therefore, we think 90% of the spend rate or so is going to continue to be on macro sites, mainly towers and also rooftops in more urban environments. So that's how we sort of see it going forward again. If you want more depth in some of the detail, we can even provide a separate session for anybody that wants that. Just contact Leah."

The most important part of the integration from a commercial standpoint is when sales force face to the customer, which is in the process of being implemented right now and that's on a fast-track. The second largest piece from, again, a customer and revenue point of view will be the integration of multiple master-lease agreements between the 2 portfolios among many customers. That's going to take probably 12 to 18 months to really get those consolidated, but those things have already started. As far as the leasability of the sites, Viom has been run as an independent third-party tower company already and therefore the documentation, the systems, the data to be able to quickly lease sites is largely already there. That's a difference than, say, a carrier portfolio like Verizon where you have to at least collect a lot of that from field offices and such. So the Viom integration from an effective leasability standpoint is going to be, I think, on a very fast-track. This will be -- this entire portfolio, this combined portfolio, is going to be jointly marketed to our customer base early on and we're already in volume discussions with many of them as to how they can take advantage of the now #1 independent tower company in India, along with our traditional sort of operating capabilities that they've come to sort of respect. So I say the Viom integration was 12 to 18 months to get it completely renegotiated around the master contracts and then have some of the fieldwork done and some of the organizational alignments fully completed. As to Verizon, we've said just recently in our last call is still the case. We have a 9% to 10% long-term sort of cumulative average growth rate expectation over 10 years for that portfolio and we still do. So every month or 2, it's not going to change, I can't imagine, materially. We're seeing new business on the sites. They're in really great shape as far as the carrier portfolio for capacity, ground space, the documentation I referred to earlier. So we're progressing through our plan and expect to be able to deliver what we've stated in the past."

Even before we get to 5G, one of the things that's happening now, and this is something Verizon discussed when it met with analysts earlier this week, is that carriers are moving to a centralized RAN design. So they're taking some of the equipment that had historically been at tower locations and moving them to central locations. However, Verizon also said that, in many cases, those central locations are other macro sites. And so since this is happening now and I imagine you're seeing some of it going on at your sites, how does this affect your business? I mean are you seeing some reduction of footprints in other -- one -- someplace, but meaningful increases in the carriers' footprint in other locations? And on net, what does this mean for you?"

There are some offsets, like you said, but generally, the way our contracts are structured, the vast majority of the lease rate, if you will, and none of it is separable -- or severable, if you will, but the vast majority of the pricing calculation is really what goes on the tower, not necessarily on the ground. Again, not of it's severable. So because you took one sort of cabinet off of your ground space, you're still paying for the square foot footprint of that ground space and you can put whatever you want or not on it. So we don't intend to reduce prices because someone moved a cabinet from one place to another or took it off the site. One of the benefits of central RAN or cloud RAN in our view is that it frees up more resources for the radio access network, the transmission equipment that goes up on the tower, which again we charge for and that's most of the amendments have to do with. So over the long term, we think RAN centralization or cloud RAN is going to be constructive for our lease growth on our sites because if much less, and I think a couple of mobile operators have said this is reducing their core network cost fairly significantly, that more resources could then be potentially devoted to the radio access network, which, again, 90% of that we think will be spent on tower and related rooftop sites."

But again, our sites tend to have substantial ground space. What's been helpful, for example, is when, say, Nextel went from having essentially a tractor-trailer full of equipment on the site down to today's Sprint, 2 cabinets and a much smaller footprint. The miniaturization of the base station electronics has actually helped us free up more ground space over time. Now there are cases when we need to get more because we have multiple customers now, which is great. But yes, I think that we're going to be in good shape to be able to host not only sort of extra cloud RAN equipment on-sites which are closer to the edge of the network, but also distributed -- someday we think there could be an opportunity for distributed storage, caching especially entertainment-type volumes of data at the tower site to reduce the latency of transmission of content. That's something down the road that our ground space could be used for. And we have some examples in our international markets where we're doing fiber ducts and other sort of very closely related ancillary uses of the ground space for incremental amendment. So we'll get every dollar we can out of every square foot of ground we can, but I think it's a bit of a long cycle, again, kind of therapeutic trend.,"

Well, we've, since 2007, positioned business development teams and very skilled ones in Asia and Latin America to always be ready when and if mobile operators or others were willing to divest of their sites or engage in some kind of a merger with us",503,"Sure. Well, we've, since 2007, positioned business development teams and very skilled ones in Asia and Latin America to always be ready when and if mobile operators or others were willing to divest of their sites or engage in some kind of a merger with us. So you're referring to some successes we've had in Brazil, India and Nigeria recently. We're still pursuing those. We're pursuing them in light and in full understanding of what our leverage targets are and Tom keeps very close triangulation on all that with the EVPs that run the regions. So everybody is well aware of what the parameters are here. In Europe, specifically, the team in that region is carefully evaluating the situation right now where there have been some movements of either privately held companies, party tower companies or carrier portfolios being separated and spun out, et cetera. But they're evaluating it carefully in the context of our disciplined kind of approach that Tom referred to already. And then perhaps the biggest factor in any of these deals, whether it's in Asia, the U.S. or Europe or elsewhere, is the asset pricing at that moment versus the expected revenue and EBITDA growth rates through the medium and long term. And when there's a dislocation between asset pricing and those long-term prospects, you do not see us act. Any major investment for us, especially given the scale we're at today and the diversification we have today, actually, Simon, needs to enhance the expected performance of our existing asset portfolio. So something we do on top of the transactions and organic growth we've already done has to make the whole cash flow curve better over time. And so those deals are difficult to find especially when you impart the discipline and patience that are the hallmarks of our investment committee, which is, me, Tom and our General Counsel, Ed here. So it's a disciplined process. And this is one example, not to try to make any kind of prediction for any other region, but you'll recall that we entered the India market in 2007. We kind of deliberately built the business a piece at a time of increasing size over a 9-year period before securing the leading position in the market with Viom. So if that's what it takes, that's what we'll do. On the other hand, if opportunities emerge quickly like in Nigeria, there were 3 trades and within sort of 9 to 12 months, we were very active in those as well. So it's hard to predict. The environment -- the M&A environment is not set just by the seller, but also by the buyer community. And if asset prices are too high, you're not going to see us that active. If asset prices are within our investment criteria, you'll see us move very quickly to move forward. So there's really not much specific to say, that we're out there, we're active and we still use the same process and asset pricing is important to us."

In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. In addition, on our IR website, you will also find our quarterly supplemental package, which includes expanded disclosure on the components of our revenue and revenue growth including historical trending of our run rate revenue, which reflects revenue associated with tenant leases that are typically noncancelable and include renewal options as well as annual escalation provisions. We believe this disclosure will provide investors with greater visibility into the key drivers of our revenue model and a simple baseline on which to model our business. 
Accordingly, we have introduced a new metric to track the currency-neutral growth of the organic component of our run rate revenue, which we will refer to as property revenue run rate organic growth. 
To the extent you have any questions on the new disclosures, please don't hesitate to reach out to myself or another member of our Investor Relations team. 
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, our property revenue grew over 19% to nearly $1.27 billion. Total revenues grew over 19% to nearly $1.29 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% to approximately $833 million. Adjusted funds from operations increased by over 17% to approximately $602 million. And net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 35% to $248 million or $0.58 per diluted common share. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
24766,330366940,968788,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had a strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first",2235,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had a strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.51 per share, which was up over 21% from the prior year period. And just last week, we closed our previously announced Viom transaction in India. Our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate Viom's more than 42,000 towers into our portfolio. This transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share and we expect it will help us continue to deliver strong growth across our key financial metrics. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we drove strong growth in all of our key metrics in the first quarter, all in the 23% to 25% range on a core basis. Our total property revenue core growth of about 25% included consolidated organic core growth of nearly 9% or over 8% on an organic run rate basis, which excludes the impact of decommissioning revenues. This strong revenue growth, combined with our disciplined expense management, led to double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share.
Turning to Slide 7. Our U.S. segment generated organic core growth for the quarter of about 7.1% which includes the positive impact of $31 million of decommissioning revenue as compared to approximately $17 million recorded in Q1 of last year. On a run rate basis, again which excludes the decommissioning revenues, U.S. organic growth was in line with our expectations at about 5.9%. Our international markets generated organic growth over 600 basis points higher than the U.S. and over 350 basis points higher than it generated in Q1 of 2015 at over 13% on a consolidated basis, the highest rate in the last 2 years. On a run rate basis, organic growth was about 14% with escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributing about 7% to our international run rate growth, and organic new business commencements were an even larger component of the growth at about 8%. That growth was partially offset by some churn of less than 1%. 
There was broad strength across our international property segments with all 3 posting double-digit organic core revenue growth rates. Our Latin American organic core growth was over 13% including 10% and 13% in Mexico and Brazil, respectively, as network rollouts remained consistent throughout the region even with some macroeconomic challenges. In India, we generated organic core growth of over 12% as large incumbent Indian wireless operators continued to spend aggressively to support the deployment of new technologies and spectrum. And in our fastest-growing region, EMEA, organic core growth was over 14% or 18% excluding our more mature German market. These strong growth rates continue to highlight the benefits of our diversification across countries, customers and technologies. 
On a global basis there are nearly 2.5 billion people in the markets that we serve and our largest customers will be investing tens of billions of dollars in those markets just this year to meet their customers' rapidly growing wireless needs. 
Complementing our organic growth on a consolidated basis were contributions from more than 25,000 sites built, leased and acquired since the beginning of last year including the Verizon, Airtel and TIM portfolios as well as the roughly 3,700 sites we built ourselves. Collectively, these new assets contributed over 16% to our core growth rate in the quarter and we're especially encouraged by the performance of our Nigerian assets, which have so far exceeded our expectations for new business. Of the 3,700 newbuild sites, about 500 were completed this quarter, generating average day 1 NOI yields of over 10%. In addition, we also built 14 new indoor DAS or small cell networks in the quarter, many in our international markets. Within the U.S., where the indoor networks have been in place the longest, our tenants per node stands at approximately 2.3, driving gross margins in the 70% to 75% range. Our return on these investments is about 15%. Including those of Viom, we now have over 700 indoor DAS venues globally. 
Moving on to Slide 8. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Our gross margin excluding pass-through remained above 80% despite the impact of the additional 25,000 new lower-tenancy, lower-margin sites we brought into our portfolio over the last year. This was the result of our strong organic gross margin conversion ratio of roughly 90%. We've been generating these types of conversion ratios for several years now. Adjusting for the impact of our recent acquisitions, this gross margin would have expanded to about 83%. 
Our land acquisition and extension team also made significant progress towards driving incremental NPV for the portfolio while enhancing our long-term U.S. gross margin and preserving future cash flows affecting more than 700 land leases this quarter by either acquiring them outright or extending them. About 50% of these transactions related to the Verizon portfolio. And as a result of our continued progress in this area over the last year, the percent of owned sites increased over 300 basis points in the U.S. from the prior year period to nearly 27% and the average remaining term of sites on leased land increased to nearly 24 years. 
In addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased about 20 basis points year-over-year after excluding the impact of the lower-margin, lower-tenancy acquired sites. 
Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined about 30 basis points year-over-year to about 8.4%. 
Our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth in the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% or about 24% on a core basis to approximately $833 million as a result of our top line growth, coupled with diligent operational expense management. A strong adjusted EBITDA-to-AFFO conversion ratio of over 81%, as well as some lower cash taxes and cash interest and capital improvement CapEx relative to our internal expectations, led to AFFO growth of over 17%. On a core basis, AFFO growth was about 25% and AFFO per share grew by about 13% to $1.41 per share.
As a result of our solid first quarter performance and improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecasts, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016 as detailed on Slide 10. At the midpoint of our outlook, we are raising our expectations for property revenue by $40 million or nearly 1%, resulting in projected growth of about 21% on both a reported and core basis. The increase is being driven primarily by $50 million in FX assumption favorability as compared to our prior outlook, partially offset by approximately $40 million associated with the delay in closing the Viom acquisition versus prior expectations. As you recall, we closed the Viom transaction on April 21 versus an expected April 1 closing. 
In addition, we expect a $20 million increase in pass-through revenue and around $9 million in incremental straight-line revenues. 
Within our total revenue projections, we are reiterating our organic growth outlook for our U.S. and international businesses. We continue to expect mid-5% organic core growth for our U.S. property segment, given consistent activity levels that have been in line with the expectations we discussed in late February. As we have touched on previously, there are a few items impacting this rate in 2016 versus 2015, including more evenly distributed new business versus it being more front end-loaded last year and flat decommissioning revenue, which are being partially offset by lower churn expectations as compared to 2015. 
On an ending run rate basis, as of December, growth for 2016 is expected to be closer to 6%. Internationally, organic growth is still expected to be nearly 12%. At a consolidated level, our expectation for total organic core growth remains unchanged at approximately 7% for the year or nearly 8% on a run rate organic growth basis. Newly acquired and built sites, which includes the impact of Viom, are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated core growth for the year or about 14%. 
Our outlook highlights the benefits of the increasing diversification of our revenue base and our decreasing dependence on any one country to deliver consistent and predictable growth. We're a vital provider of communications real estate in vibrant markets like Mexico where aggressive 4G rollouts are ramping up, in Brazil where significant 3G network augmentation is continuing and in India where the transition from 2G is only now getting underway for a majority of the population. This diversification supports our ability to generate consistent sustainable growth rates on a consolidated basis. 
Our improved revenue growth outlook and strong conversion rates are in turn expected to lead to a higher 2016 adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $25 million or nearly 1% at the midpoint. This reflects a negative $20 million impact due to the delayed Viom closing. This is being more than offset, however, by a $10 million increase in cash EBITDA projected from our existing business as a result of better cost performance as well as an expected $35 million benefit from improving foreign currency exchange forecasts and incremental net straight-line impacts. 
As detailed on Slide 11, we are also raising our outlook for AFFO by $20 million at the midpoint or nearly 1% versus our prior outlook despite the negative $20 million impact of the delayed Viom close on cash adjusted EBITDA. The impact of the delay is being partially offset by a $10 million increase in expected legacy cash EBITDA; a $5 million decrease in the combination of cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures on an FX-neutral basis as well as a benefit of approximately $25 million resulting from the improvement in foreign currency forecasts. As a result, assuming a weighted average diluted share count of 429 million shares, the midpoint of our outlook now implies an AFFO per share of $5.65, representing year-over-year per share growth of over 11%.
Turning to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we declared over $240 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed nearly $160 million in CapEx in Q1. We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions will create meaningful value for our stockholders. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our REIT distribution subject to board approval of at least 20%. 
We are also committed to maintaining a substantial base of liquidity and a solid balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio stood at 5x net debt to annualized Q1 adjusted EBITDA, with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below, and longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3x and 5x. 
As a result of our consistent capital deployment strategy, we expect to extend our track record of delivering strong financial results in 2016 as is detailed on Slide 13 and even more importantly are positioning ourselves for strong sustainable growth going forward. In fact, at the midpoint of our outlook, we will have grown property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO at a mid-teen percentage clip since 2007 while at the same time maintaining return on invested capital of between 9% and 10% despite adding over 25,000 new sites since the beginning of 2015. We expect these new sites will enhance our future growth trajectory over the long term while enhancing total returns.
Turning to Slide 14 and in summary. We started 2016 with a strong operational quarter, announced our entry into Tanzania, built nearly 500 sites and closed our acquisition of a controlling stake in Viom Networks just last week. Our top priority remains driving continued operational excellence while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to sustain strong growth in all of our key metrics and margin performance and are raising our 2016 outlook for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Similar to last year, we expect core growth in all 3 to be above our long-term targets. But by year-end, we expect to have nearly 150,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and leverage back within our target range. 
Due to our disciplined, consistent global capital allocation program, we continued to generate strong organic core revenue growth supported by a high-quality asset base diversified across geographies, carriers and network technologies with a global portfolio more than triple the size of our closest U.S. publicly traded peers. Our significant exposure to high-growth markets and our carefully cultivated asset base positions us to not only benefit from significant near-term network investments, but to also deliver strong and steady growth over the long term. As a result, we expect to continue to generate consistent, recurring growth in AFFO per share and a highly compelling total return to stockholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

The first quarter results we've just reported today again demonstrate continued solid demand for tower space both in the U.S. and in our diversified international markets. In the United States, cons",1200,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. The first quarter results we've just reported today again demonstrate continued solid demand for tower space both in the U.S. and in our diversified international markets. 
In the United States, consumers' ever-increasing appetite for mobile bandwidth has supported cumulative wireless carrier CapEx of nearly $180 billion over just the last 5 years with approximately another $95 billion in spectrum auction spending as well. The deployment of 4G technology at higher spectrum bands has driven significant colocation during this period due to the need for a more dense network array. In addition, each new spectrum band acquired and deployed into the network has driven additional amendment activity in the form of more antennas and remote radio heads on our towers. In the United States, the 4 major wireless carriers are at or close to the completion of their Phase 1 coverage deployment of 4G technology. 
So what does this mean for the level of demand for tower space going forward domestically? The primary message of my remarks today is that we expect demand for macro tower space to remain robust as mobile operators progress through their subsequent deployment phases for 4G and then on to 5G deployments, thereafter. Our conclusions are based on a combination of internal and external analyses that we have conducted over the past 2 years. 
Now in the past, you've heard us describe many of the technical and economic factors that support the continued use of towers as the optimal siting solution for mobile transmitters especially in suburban and rural environments and along transportation corridors such as highways. Today, I'd like to focus the discussion at a much more personal level: the factors that drive a satisfying user experience on our mobile devices. 
Each of us is very familiar with these performance factors as we use our smartphones every day. These factors are: first, coverage; second, capacity; and third, and more importantly as time goes on, peak speed. So coverage, capacity and peak speed. So let's say you're taking the Metro-North train for your commute from Rye to Grand Central Station, a ride of about 45 minutes or so. Along that route, most of your trip would be served by wireless transmission sites on macro towers including our towers in Harrison, Mamaroneck and in the Bronx. While on the train, you want to watch cnn.com video clips for the day's news on your phone. Coverage would be represented by the number of signal bars you see in the upper left hand corner of your screen, and by the way, it's just coverage. Capacity, meanwhile, would determine how many people on the train could watch streaming video at the same time as you. If capacity isn't sufficient, even if the coverage bars are there, then many of the viewers will experience buffering, they'll start to see the spinning wheel that we all dread instead of the video we want to watch. And finally, peak speed will determine the quality of that video experience. Does it come across crisp? Or is it grainy, choppy and pretty much unwatchable? So coverage, capacity and speed all need to be there to give you a good user experience. 
Based on the level of investment by your particular wireless service provider, your experience could vary drastically on each of these dimensions as you progress along your commute. We're now at the stage where most U.S. wireless carriers have deployed the majority of their 4G coverage sites. So in practice, the vast majority of us U.S. mobile subscribers have access to 4G bars when we look at our phone. 
The anticipated 6x increase in mobile traffic from 2015 to 2020, however, can't just be solved through these Phase 1 coverage sites. Wireless carriers are continuing to make significant investments in their networks to increase capacity across most of their sites including in suburban and rural areas and also along those transportation corridors. This capacity augmentation happens in 2 ways. First, carriers can add new spectrum bands, often resulting in amendments on our sites through new or larger multi-frequency antennas. We're seeing this with bands such as AWS-3, WCS and 2.5 gigahertz already. And second, wireless carriers are actively refarming 2G and 3G spectrum into 4G to gain better spectral efficiency across all of their spectrum. This is currently being implemented across the cellular 800 megahertz band by some carriers as well as PCS bands and also drives amendments on our towers as older antennas are typically swapped out for larger, more advanced antennas when the refarming of spectrum occurs. 
In addition to their focus on coverage and capacity, you've been seeing in their advertisements that carriers have also now started to shift their marketing towards an emphasis on peak speeds. This shift drives further investment into cell sites through technologies such as carrier aggregation as well as adding new cell sites to reduce the transmission radius and therefore the quality improvement for each signal. This increase in cell site density is expected to drive incremental colocation opportunities on macro towers as customers like us demand higher and higher peak speeds to enhance our user experience. 
All this points to not only significant continuing 4G LTE investments, but also to the subsequent deployment of 5G, which is not expected to be widely available until at least the 2020 time frame, though some free standard or trial deployments are possible over the intervening next few years. 
So similar to 3G and 4G deployments in the past, 5G is likely to start in those dense urban environments in which capacity and signal strength challenges are the greatest and then spread to suburban and rural locations over time. While very high-frequency bands of spectrum such as millimeter wave might be effective for 5G in dense urban mobile environments and maybe as a fiber-to-home substitute, it's our view that lower-band spectrum will continue to be used for mobile 5G service in suburban and rural areas where our towers are located given the need for broader coverage and a less acute requirement for point capacity. 
Coincidentally, the 600-megahertz spectrum currently being auctioned should be cleared in the same general 2020 time frame as the commencement of large scale 5G deployments. The newly available 600-megahertz spectrum could be used for 5G rollouts outside of dense urban locations without disrupting 4G spectrum bands already in use or causing significant interference. 
As a result, carriers would once again need to install additional or larger multi-band antennas on towers, which we would expect to result in incremental revenue growth for us. Even that more than 80% of the U.S. population resides outside of urban areas, we view this as a long-term opportunity for our 5G portfolio -- for our portfolio as 5G gets implemented down the road. 
So to summarize. Even in a 5G world, we believe that macro towers will continue to be a foundational building block for mobile network deployments in the U.S. and globally. Consequently, we are confident that demand for tower space will continue to remain robust for many years to come. 
So thanks again for joining us this morning, and Tony, you can open the line for questions now."

The kind of the run rate metric that Leah talked about in her opening remarks is a new metric that we're adding. We talked about it last time we were together, but it isolates just kind of the recurring leased-base run rate revenue that we generate on an FX-neutral basis and we think that provides more transparency into the components, which really drive the tenant run rate growth. And so that's what is driving the 5.9%. So it excludes decommissioning revenues and those types of things, back billing, amortization revenue, those types of things. And we think it gives more clarity in terms of what really is the run rate growth in the business. The 5.5% is our traditional core organic growth, which is the one that we've historically talked about, which represents the kind of the same-tower store growth on those assets that we've owned for at least 12 months. And so that's what's really driving the difference between the 2 metrics. And on the Viom piece, in 2016, we now expect to generate about $555 million of revenue from Viom, about $245 million in gross margin contribution, I think around $215 million in EBITDA and that represents the closing as of the April 21. Going forward, over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll look to merge our existing legacy business, which is our 15,000 sites that we have within ATC India, it generates a couple of hundred million dollars a year, with the Viom business. And then, over time -- and that will take our ownership interests up from the current 51% into the mid-60s. And then, following that period of time, we'll look at whether, how -- financially what makes sense in terms of bringing the rest of the business in. I mean, it's our objective that we would want to own 100% of the business. We have some very strong partners within the business including the Tatas and Macquarie and so we're really excited about controlling the business, running the business with that kind of participation. So I would expect over the next 3 to 4 years we'll have more clarity in terms of just what we ultimately end up with from an ownership perspective of the business. But our immediate goal is to merge the 2 businesses where, then, we can really start to recognize what we believe in some synergies."

First of all, the overall CapEx from year-to-year in the U.S. wireless industry is expected to be flat around $30 billion. So if there are moderated ups and downs among individual carriers, the total is looking to be about the same, which means our aggregate new business opportunity among the major tower operators ought to look similar from 2015 to 2016. That's how we've introduced our guidance and informed our guidance. And at the end of the day, we're looking more at the overall markets now especially with the segment reporting we've moved to. And so the U.S. run rate leasing metric that Tom talked about is we expect 6% or so in the United States, which is very solid. The other thing I'd like to say about the run rate metric, we're giving you yet another lens to look at the business. I think it's a good lens because it actually -- it's very similar to the way a lot of real estate investors look at the assets, which is what are your rent increases and rent pricing over time and what's your occupancy increases over time and that really just encapsulates all of that in the run rate and it takes out some of these amortized contributions and other onetime settlements and things like that, that cause you to have to pull them apart to figure out what the real run rate is. So we're just going to give that to you. So when you take the U.S. 6% run rate and then you know the other part of our strategy is diversification across carriers, technologies, continents, et cetera, and our international run rate leasing is 14% this year, so the weighted average is about 8% and this is what we're trying to preserve over many, many years, which is a weighted average, smooth, rising curve of revenue growth, which then drives the double-digit expectation and objective we have for AFFO per share growth. So individual carriers in the U.S. are really important, but we're looking at more the market level now. And when you look at the aggregates, we've still got $30 billion of spending and 6% of run rate growth in the domestic business. And then the last thing I'll say, and Tom referred to it a couple of times, is we're really starting to focus on efficiency especially in the domestic business to get costs out of it, performance to be at or above, as far as revenue and top line growth, and that's going to help us with the AFFO per share contribution from the U.S. over time as well. So I really think it's important if you want to understand the carriers' individual plans to refer to their public statements specifically or talk to them individually. But we're really going to be looking at market-level and region-level trends from this point on."

So Jonathan, I think you know we don't speak to individual contract negotiations or even outcomes with the mobile operators really anywhere. We've described that we have offered holistic-type agreements when mobile operators are in sort of a ramp-up or a high-spend mode. And that just helps them in a couple of ways: one is to budget more accurately and understand what their costs will be going forward; and secondly, it reduces the cycle times and therefore increases the surety of when their deployments will be implemented as far as the schedule perspective. So those benefits are still there. Some of the mobile operators are taking advantage of those now. Some of them have decided to either stay on or move toward or away from a more retail type of operation. So without specifying any of those, those are the range of options. And carriers move among those options based on their investment cycle, which, again, speaks to the benefit of diversification when you can do those multiple-type contracts. So secondly, on the in-building side, I would like to think we are a bit of a pioneer in a way, especially in Latin America, to introduce this technology. It'll come into EMEA and especially Africa next on our part. But Mexico and Brazil have been really strong for us on in-building, and Viom, to its credit, is more of a pioneer in in-building in the India market with a couple of hundred venues, much more actually than we even have. So it's actually a very good match on the small cell side as well, Viom and ATC India. But those are probably the 3 places with the most opportunity right now, Mexico, Brazil and India."

What's happening in Mexico right now is something that, again, has happened in the U.S. and other markets earlier and that is the rate of 4G adoption can be sort of governed, if you will, by 2 things in any market: one is service pricing and the other one is handset pricing. So the lower the handset pricing and the lower the service pricing, the more people can afford it and will sign up and start using it and grow over time in their usage. So in Mexico, the government successfully increased the level of competition in that country. Service pricing moved in a constructive way for the population to be able to adopt data services more rapidly than they could before. And globally, handset pricing for 4G is also reducing at the same time. So you have these 2 complementary cost unit reductions in handsets and service pricing and people in Mexico are signing up. So that then, as we've always seen in every other case, increased smartphone penetration, 3G usage and ultimately 4G, drives gigabits per month on the network and that network demand needs to be serviced in large part often by adding equipment to real estate including towers. It's the typical cycle we've seen, but I'd say the 2 drivers are reduced handset pricing and reduced service pricing for data."

So historically, we've thought of escalators as being something north of 3% for your business, particularly in the United States. But escalators, as we all know, is supposed to be tied to inflation. That's essentially the whole purpose of why they were designed. And inflation, as we all know, both when we look backwards as well as, I think, when we look forward is much less than that right now. And I'm curious if because of that, you're starting to see some pushback on the escalators on new deals you're signing in the United States, and if you're still able to achieve the 3-plus percent or is it actually now something closer to, for example, 2%. And then my second question just goes back to some of the comments Jim made talking about the U.S. market. I think one of the things that's going to be different with the build-out of 5G relative to previous generational builds is the use of outdoor small cells. And it looks like from a topology perspective, particularly when you think of some of the higher-band frequencies that are going to be used, small cells are going to command a greater portion of the overall investment dollars for network build-outs than has historically happened. And I'm curious if you think that, that's going to limit the level of macro tower growth you're going to see in the United States tied to 5G versus the growth rates we've seen in previous generational build-outs?"

So of course, there's an inflation kind of concept, second order, behind that, but land rent costs are the largest costs of ongoing tower operations and ground lessors have been able to secure 3-plus percent escalators, often, on ground leases. So those are mirrored in the tower lease. Moving to the outdoor small cell 5G issue, I would invite you to get a hold of Leah separately because we've got some pretty in-depth technical assessments on how this works whether it's a 3G, 4G or 5G. And yes, in dense urban networks -- dense urban environments, networks do have to have much shorter transmission radii. Small cells make sense for them for 3G, 4G and, ultimately, they will make sense for 5G. But what we serve is the suburban rural and transportation corridor market, not urban or dense urban. 97.5% of our towers are in non-dense urban environments and the reason that carriers use towers predominantly in those environments because that is the optimal height, power setting and transmission radius for suburban rural and transportation corridor use cases. The proportion of small cell spending, our projection is that, yes, as a percentage of CapEx, it will double over the next 5 years from 5% to approximately 10%. That's our estimate. Therefore, we think 90% of the spend rate or so is going to continue to be on macro sites, mainly towers and also rooftops in more urban environments. So that's how we sort of see it going forward again. If you want more depth in some of the detail, we can even provide a separate session for anybody that wants that. Just contact Leah."

The most important part of the integration from a commercial standpoint is when sales force face to the customer, which is in the process of being implemented right now and that's on a fast-track. The second largest piece from, again, a customer and revenue point of view will be the integration of multiple master-lease agreements between the 2 portfolios among many customers. That's going to take probably 12 to 18 months to really get those consolidated, but those things have already started. As far as the leasability of the sites, Viom has been run as an independent third-party tower company already and therefore the documentation, the systems, the data to be able to quickly lease sites is largely already there. That's a difference than, say, a carrier portfolio like Verizon where you have to at least collect a lot of that from field offices and such. So the Viom integration from an effective leasability standpoint is going to be, I think, on a very fast-track. This will be -- this entire portfolio, this combined portfolio, is going to be jointly marketed to our customer base early on and we're already in volume discussions with many of them as to how they can take advantage of the now #1 independent tower company in India, along with our traditional sort of operating capabilities that they've come to sort of respect. So I say the Viom integration was 12 to 18 months to get it completely renegotiated around the master contracts and then have some of the fieldwork done and some of the organizational alignments fully completed. As to Verizon, we've said just recently in our last call is still the case. We have a 9% to 10% long-term sort of cumulative average growth rate expectation over 10 years for that portfolio and we still do. So every month or 2, it's not going to change, I can't imagine, materially. We're seeing new business on the sites. They're in really great shape as far as the carrier portfolio for capacity, ground space, the documentation I referred to earlier. So we're progressing through our plan and expect to be able to deliver what we've stated in the past."

Even before we get to 5G, one of the things that's happening now, and this is something Verizon discussed when it met with analysts earlier this week, is that carriers are moving to a centralized RAN design. So they're taking some of the equipment that had historically been at tower locations and moving them to central locations. However, Verizon also said that, in many cases, those central locations are other macro sites. And so since this is happening now and I imagine you're seeing some of it going on at your sites, how does this affect your business? I mean are you seeing some reduction of footprints in other -- one -- someplace, but meaningful increases in the carriers' footprint in other locations? And on net, what does this mean for you?"

There are some offsets, like you said, but generally, the way our contracts are structured, the vast majority of the lease rate, if you will, and none of it is separable -- or severable, if you will, but the vast majority of the pricing calculation is really what goes on the tower, not necessarily on the ground. Again, not of it's severable. So because you took one sort of cabinet off of your ground space, you're still paying for the square foot footprint of that ground space and you can put whatever you want or not on it. So we don't intend to reduce prices because someone moved a cabinet from one place to another or took it off the site. One of the benefits of central RAN or cloud RAN in our view is that it frees up more resources for the radio access network, the transmission equipment that goes up on the tower, which again we charge for and that's most of the amendments have to do with. So over the long term, we think RAN centralization or cloud RAN is going to be constructive for our lease growth on our sites because if much less, and I think a couple of mobile operators have said this is reducing their core network cost fairly significantly, that more resources could then be potentially devoted to the radio access network, which, again, 90% of that we think will be spent on tower and related rooftop sites."

But again, our sites tend to have substantial ground space. What's been helpful, for example, is when, say, Nextel went from having essentially a tractor-trailer full of equipment on the site down to today's Sprint, 2 cabinets and a much smaller footprint. The miniaturization of the base station electronics has actually helped us free up more ground space over time. Now there are cases when we need to get more because we have multiple customers now, which is great. But yes, I think that we're going to be in good shape to be able to host not only sort of extra cloud RAN equipment on-sites which are closer to the edge of the network, but also distributed -- someday we think there could be an opportunity for distributed storage, caching especially entertainment-type volumes of data at the tower site to reduce the latency of transmission of content. That's something down the road that our ground space could be used for. And we have some examples in our international markets where we're doing fiber ducts and other sort of very closely related ancillary uses of the ground space for incremental amendment. So we'll get every dollar we can out of every square foot of ground we can, but I think it's a bit of a long cycle, again, kind of therapeutic trend.,"

Well, we've, since 2007, positioned business development teams and very skilled ones in Asia and Latin America to always be ready when and if mobile operators or others were willing to divest of their sites or engage in some kind of a merger with us. So you're referring to some successes we've had in Brazil, India and Nigeria recently. We're still pursuing those. We're pursuing them in light and in full understanding of what our leverage targets are and Tom keeps very close triangulation on all that with the EVPs that run the regions. So everybody is well aware of what the parameters are here. In Europe, specifically, the team in that region is carefully evaluating the situation right now where there have been some movements of either privately held companies, party tower companies or carrier portfolios being separated and spun out, et cetera. But they're evaluating it carefully in the context of our disciplined kind of approach that Tom referred to already. And then perhaps the biggest factor in any of these deals, whether it's in Asia, the U.S. or Europe or elsewhere, is the asset pricing at that moment versus the expected revenue and EBITDA growth rates through the medium and long term. And when there's a dislocation between asset pricing and those long-term prospects, you do not see us act. Any major investment for us, especially given the scale we're at today and the diversification we have today, actually, Simon, needs to enhance the expected performance of our existing asset portfolio. So something we do on top of the transactions and organic growth we've already done has to make the whole cash flow curve better over time. And so those deals are difficult to find especially when you impart the discipline and patience that are the hallmarks of our investment committee, which is, me, Tom and our General Counsel, Ed here. So it's a disciplined process. And this is one example, not to try to make any kind of prediction for any other region, but you'll recall that we entered the India market in 2007. We kind of deliberately built the business a piece at a time of increasing size over a 9-year period before securing the leading position in the market with Viom. So if that's what it takes, that's what we'll do. On the other hand, if opportunities emerge quickly like in Nigeria, there were 3 trades and within sort of 9 to 12 months, we were very active in those as well. So it's hard to predict. The environment -- the M&A environment is not set just by the seller, but also by the buyer community. And if asset prices are too high, you're not going to see us that active. If asset prices are within our investment criteria, you'll see us move very quickly to move forward.

Good morning, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter earning. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the second quarter 2016 as well as our full year outlook for the full year of 2016. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on our international business and strategy. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations for future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. 
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factories set forth in this morning's press release; those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015; and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation which we will a reference throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations step on our website. I'd like to note that we have updated the name of our run rate revenue metric to tenant billing. As we highlighted for you last quarter when we introduced this metric, it reflects the current tenant billings, which are generated by our global portfolio of communications real estate. In addition, in response to recently issued disclosure guidance by the SEC, after today, we will no longer reference our core growth metrics. 
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.43 billion. Total revenues grew approximately 23% to over $1.44 billion, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 24% to $161 million or $0.37 per diluted common share. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was over 18% and included an income tax reserve related to our Viom transaction. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate will be in the low double digit. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter grew 14% to approximately $869 million, and consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by over 10% to approximately $592 million or $1.38 per diluted share. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
24766,370254868,1015036,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Okay, thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As can see from the results we released this morning, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and good margin performance across our global asset base.

As can see from the results we released this morning, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also declared a common stock dividend of $0.53 a share, which was up over 20% from the prior year period. And given the close of our Viom transaction in late April, our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate the more than 42,000 towers we added to our portfolio with that acquisition. 
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take it a lower-quality quarterly results. You can see that we generated stronger performance with total reported property revenue growth of about 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 23%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent demand levels throughout our global footprint. Our total property revenue growth this quarter included a negative 60 basis point impact from a $7 million revenue reserve related to our receivables associated with a tenant in Brazil, which were outstanding at the time of their judicial reorganization filing. Based on our prior experiences with carrier bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings, we expect to pursue the full amount owed to us. Additionally, I would note that this tenant has resumed payments to us for amounts of subsequent to their judicial reorganization filing date. 
Our U.S. property segment generated total reported revenue growth of about 3%, including a negative 1.4% impact from straight-line revenue account recognition. We did not book any decommissioning revenue this quarter as compared to about $8 million recorded in Q2 of last year and $31 million or so booked in Q1. This negatively impacted our U.S. property revenue growth by an additional 1.1%. 
U.S. organic tenant billings growth for the quarter was 5.6%, which again reflects organic build recurring revenue and was right in line with our expectations. Demand trend in the U.S. remain very steady with carriers actively spending to augment their 4G networks. Our international markets generated organic tenant billings growth of 13.7% or 800 basis points higher than that of the U.S. Escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributed about 7% to that growth, while organic new business commencements were an even larger component of the growth in about 7.6%. These were partially offset by churn of just over 1%. 
There was broad strength across our international property segments, with all 3 posting double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates, including 12% in Latin America, 20% in EMEA and over 10% in Asia. Our multinational tenant base in these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to advance headsets, handsets of lower per unit cost and begin to use exponentially more data on those handsets. The benefits of the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model continues to be evidenced by the strong growth rates we were generating in our international markets. 
Finally, on a total property basis, the day one revenue associated with the nearly 57,000 sites we have added since the second quarter of last year, including the Viom, Airtel Nigeria and team Brazil portfolios and roughly 3,400 new builds contributed another 15% to our total tenant billings growth in Q2, bringing the total growth to the nearly 23%. Our new build program remains active, and we constructed nearly 400 towers this quarter with an average day 1 NOI yield of over 10%. 
Moving on to Slide 7. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Gross margin in the quarter remained strong at over 68% despite a negative impact of over 10% from passthrough and a negative impact of 4.6% due to addition of new sites, which have lowered initial tenancies and margins. This was supported by strong conversion of revenue to gross margin on legacy sites during the quarter, while our reported conversion of revenue to gross margin was around 49% as a result of the previously mentioned negative impacts of pass-through revenue and lower tenancy new sites, which on a combined basis negatively impacted the reported conversion ratio by about 50%. Our ability to convert revenue to gross margin on our pre-existing sites remain strong and in line with historical norms of well over 90%. 
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60% for the quarter, which includes a negative impact from pass-through of about 9%. This also includes about 4.3% of margin dilution associated with new sites brought into the portfolio since the start of the second quarter last year, including Viom. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue was about 8.1% in the quarter and is expected to be right around 8% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter was detailed on Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to about $869 million as a result of our top line growth coupled with the diligent operational expense management. Our solid adjusted EBITDA performance drove growth in consolidated AFFO at slightly lower-than-expected capital improvement capital expenditures. This led to growth in consolidated AFFO of over 10% and growth in consolidated AFFO per share of nearly 10%. The global operational efficiency initiatives that we put into place continue to result in strong profitability for the business. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with financial policies designed to support this objective by managing risk across the capital structure in support of our investment-grade rating. In the second quarter, we pursued several financing initiatives directly supporting these policies. First, we raised $1 billion in 10-year senior unsecured notes at a historically low coupon rates for ATC in 3 3/8%. This opportunistic transaction increased our liquidity and turned out a significant portion of our floating rate debt. Next, we assumed nearly $800 million of rupee-denominated debt in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in Viom. We immediately commenced a multiyear process to refinance the existing loans locally at more attractive rates than the initial 11% average coupon. They have already decreased the average cost to about 10.3%. These actions highlight our excellent access to diversified funding sources, including the investment-grade volume market as well as an ability to maintain a substantial base of liquidity system to support our solid balance sheet. As a result, at the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 5.3x net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below, and longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3 and 5x.
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid performance in the first half of the year, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and underlying trends that are consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016. At the midpoint of our outlook, we're increasing our expectations for property revenue by $10 million or about 0.2%, resulting in projected reported gross of 21% or so. The increase is being driven by $14 million increase in straight-line revenue and $7 million in favorability in organic tenant billing revenue across our property segment. This favorability is being partially offset by about $7 million from the reserve book this quarter in Brazil as well as about $4 million associated with lower expected pass-through revenue. The positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations versus our prior outlook for revenue is just about $1 million given that the devaluation of [indiscernible] is offsetting the strengthening of the majority of our other currencies. Also, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from any of our pending transactions that have yet to close. 
Within our total revenue projections, we expect in the U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.5% to 6% for the year. This reflects the steady demand environment similar to we have seen year-to-date and anticipate that acceleration in our growth rate in the second half of the year as a result of the more even spread of new business commencements compared to the prior year period. Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of nearly 14% supported by especially strong trends in markets like Mexico and Nigeria and Uganda where new business commencement activity is incredibly strong. At a consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Newly-acquired and build sites are expected to contribute to balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year or just over 14%. This growth has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now on a consolidated basis stand at nearly $32 billion with an average remaining lease term of about 5.6 years. We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. This reflects cash SG&A as a percent of total revenue of right around 8%. Our increased adjusted EBITDA outlook is driven by an $8 million benefit associated with increased net straight-line, $17 million in FX favorability and about $6 million in outperformance in the underlying property business relative to our previous expectations. This is being partially offset by $7 million receivable reserve booked in Q2 and about $9 million in lower expected contribution from our services segment versus our prior outlook where the pipeline of project-based activity has slowed. Given that substantially all of our Nigerian OpEx and SG&A expenses are denominated in local currency and that over half of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, the impact of the Nigerian devaluation that I referenced earlier to EBITDA is minimal. 
Finally, we're raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $15 million at the midpoint or about 0.6%. This is being driven primarily by the $7 million increase in cash EBITDA, just discussed, plus roughly $13 million due to lower net cash interest expense expectations. This increase of $20 million is being partially offset by about $5 million resulting from higher expectations for corporate capital expenditures, primarily associated with IT spending to support our global operations. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.69 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of about 12%. 
Before we move on, I also like to note that factoring in the July month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of about $33 million for property revenue, $18 million for adjusted EBITDA and $14 million for consolidated AFFO or about $0.03 per share relative to the midpoints of our current outlook.
Turning to Slide 11. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we declared nearly $500 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends, spent approximately $1.2 trillion [ph] on accretive acquisitions and deployed nearly $330 million in CapEx so far this year, which includes nearly $76 million spent on ground lease purchases. In fact, since 2011, we deployed over $500 million for ground lease purchases in the U.S. while increasing the percentage of towers online to we own or control for over 20 years from about 55% in 2011 to nearly 67% today and extending the average remaining term on our lease land from just under 22 years to nearly 25 years. This activity further secures our long-term recurring cash flows while generating margin improvement and enhancing the operating leverage of our business through land rent expense reduction. We expect to continue deploying capital for land purchases over the long term and are targeting to have 80% of our towers in the U.S. on land that is either owned or leased for more than 20 years by 2020. 
We believe that our disciplined capital allocation strategy will enable us to deliver the combination of growth and consolidated AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions and drive compelling total returns for many years to come. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our dividend subject of board approval of at least 20%. 
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we've enhanced our strategic positioning so far in 2016 by continuing to employ a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy. First, we further diversified our international presence by acquiring a controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. We believe mobile networks there are poised for significant 4G investment in urban metros and for a continuing deployment of coverage and initial data services in the suburban and rural areas where over 2/3 of Indians live. Second, we've continued to drive operational excellence through our business while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios in several key markets. And third, we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing and selected debt repayments. And fourth, we've simultaneously maintain strong growth in our common stock dividend. As a result, we are well positioned to finish this year strong, driving compelling growth in revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO while returning significant cash to our shareholders through our common stock dividend. This is all made possible by our unmatched global scale, experienced regional leadership teams and disciplined the capital allocation strategy, which we expect to remain consistent for the rest of this year and well into the future. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated a",1037,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated another strong quarter of operating results in Q2, once again serving as a turbocharger for our market-leading domestic business. 
Beginning with American Tower's first international investment in Mexico in 1999, we methodically expanded our geographic scope and scale based on a set of fundamental tenants. First, we recognized that the power of the tower business model that has first been developed in the United States should equally apply in additional countries that presented the right operating conditions. It is our experience that due to a number of common factors, the fundamental drivers of tower demand are consistent across our selected geographies. First, consumers everywhere have a huge appetite for mobile technology and service. And moreover, the underlying physics of radiowave propagation, usable spectrum bands and the 2G, 3G and 4G technology standards all apply globally. Plus, the network equipment on the OEMs, the handset manufacturers such as Apple and the chipset developers like QUALCOMM sell their products all over the world. Second, we understood from our U.S. experience that by buying towers for mobile operators, we can transform single-use, nonperforming cost center assets into high-performing, multiuse commercial real estate. Consequently, sale leaseback transactions for these assets provide an additional source of capital to mobile operators so they could more rapidly deploy their active networks and grow their core business. Again, since these commonsense economics apply across multiple countries, we've been able to pursue the same strategy successfully to date in Latin America, Africa, Germany and India. 
And third, we recognized that we did dramatically increase our growth opportunities while at the same time, benefiting from the diversity across various markets. Using standard portfolio theory, we expected that selectively diversifying our asset base, we could also reduce fluctuations in our cash flows, thereby delivering elevated, extended and more stable growth trajectory over a very long period of time. The results we have generated in our international markets confirm these principles. For example, on sites outside the U.S. that we've owned since the beginning of 2010, our U.S. dollar equivalent NOI yield as of the end of the second quarter was more than 30% as compared to around 18% on net vintage in the U.S. These results include both sites that we have acquired as part of our disciplined asset acquisition strategy and sites that we've constructed for our carrier customers. 
Meanwhile, international sites added between 2010 and 2013 are already yielding around 12% today, with sites added over the last few years already yielding an average of about 10%. While the yields on our younger international assets are solid, we believe the real opportunities to make value on these newer assets lies ahead. Our 2 decades of strength in the tower business have clearly illustrated that the longer we have assets on our portfolio, the more revenue and cash flow they generate. This is especially true outside the U.S. where most of our newly added sites have been single tenant at the time of acquisition or construction. Given that we have generated double-digit international organic tenant billings growth on average over the last 3 years and expect to continue to drive these types of solid growth rates going forward, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to drive significant NOI yield accretion on our international assets over time. 
Consequently, we have positioned to the company for continuing long-term success with our combined domestic U.S. and global asset base. MIT researchers Erik Robison and Andrew McAfee have identified 3 key elements to building competitive advantage in the digital age: physical capital, intellectual capital and organizational capital. On all 3 of these dimensions, American Tower now has built a sustainable global competitive advantage in telecommunications real estate, which we believe would be difficult to replicate. First is our physical capital, the 140,000-plus towers in small cell systems that we've constructed and acquired, their high structural capacity, premier locations and existing and future cash flow generation potential. The depth, diversity and global reach of this physical capital are, in our view, unmatched. And we believe that replicating our portfolio while achieving similar economics in the future would be a very formidable task. 
Second is the intellectual capital we have cultivated at American Tower since the mid-1990s. The systems and processes that we've developed, refined and optimized to be able to support 10s of thousands of properties spanning in 5 continents, and it positions company further asset growth in the future. I actually believe that ATC is world-class in the most critical operational skills in this business, formulating highly complex master lease agreement tailored to our customers' needs, coupled with the ability to manage literally hundreds of thousands of individual tenant and ground leases every month. 
And third is the organizational capital that has been nurtured and developed at all levels in this company. I believe we have the most capable senior management team in the industry that have in turn built high-performance organizations in our key functions across all of our geographies. Our retention of highly skilled executives, management and employees have been excellent, resulting in an experienced workforce today. Additionally, as a recognized global leader, American Tower's brand enabled us to recruit outstanding talent to support the rapid growth of the business. We've also developed comprehensive training and development programs targeted to continually improve our capabilities and proprietary skills such as structural engineering and lease contracting.
So as a result of building our physical, intellectual, organizational capital methodically over the past 20 years, we've maintained the leadership position among fully independent tower companies in each of the leading 3 market democracies on the 5 most populous continents in the world while creating a cash flow engine that continues to gather momentum. With our unique and dynamic position in this telecommunications real estate business, we expect to provide an attractive combination of growth and yield to our investors for many, many years to come. 
Thank you for joining our call this morning, and operator, please open it up now for questions."

And then I guess within that, during the quarter, I feel like there's been a lot of questions or conversations about how to think about future escalator rates in the U.S. with perhaps some of the carriers expressing some consternation about the compounding growth outlook of that cost structure would be for them. Maybe you can provide us with some insight on what you're hearing from your conversations with carriers and whether you believe there's either a risk or perhaps middle ground going forward?"

Now we can start to see the trend of the business as part is far of duration and falloff. So for 2016, our expected remaining term for the 4 nationals is 6.6 years, and the churn is only approximately 0.2%. So we feel very confident about the stability of our U.S. domestic sort of Big 4 asset base or revenue base right now. And the other piece of that is the escalator, which across the U.S. on average is still above 3%. So I'll turn it over to Tom."

And so we fully believe that all the carriers are generating their own sine waves in terms of new business, grooming, colos, amendments.

Just maybe this is for you, Jim or Tom. Just following up on the early question. The T-Mobile and AT&T I think pretty explicitly gone out there and try to solicit alternatives for macrocell sites that have been compounding for maybe 10 or even 20 years, and there's a conceivably a window for economic substitution for new tower builds. Could you talk about what you see is the vulnerability of the AMT's domestic portfolio in terms of long-term leases that have compounded with terms of leases that are expiring with alternative sightings that might be nearby? It doesn't seem like it could be very big, but I'm wondering if you see if at all as a potential vulnerability at this stage? And then second, in India, obviously, party [indiscernible] has been talking about the potential for resetting leases pricing lower at the end of the term of some of their main shareholder leases. Obviously, with Viom, you're going to have a larger overlap with them. I was wondering if you could kind of talk about the outlook for market lease pricing in India going forward?"

What I would say about potential substitution anywhere for towers is that, just to remind you, you all know the functional inputs of the franchise value of the tower. And so first of all, any change of equipment from one tower to an",445,"Sure, David. It's Jim. What I would say about potential substitution anywhere for towers is that, just to remind you, you all know the functional inputs of the franchise value of the tower. And so first of all, any change of equipment from one tower to another one, assuming you could even build it nearby, is fairly costly for any operator, so that's something they have to put in their equation. Also, the longer the sites have been up, the more [indiscernible] beyond, et cetera, and more embedded it is on the network. So there are some network difficulties and economic cost to doing a switch. And as you know, the other part of the franchise value is that most municipalities try to manage the number of structures in their jurisdiction, and we'd take that into account. And then thirdly, we continually try to reach mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers that can ameliorate the impact of specific high-priced sites as far as the contract. So we'll continue to help them as we can in that way as well. So I do think that having some metrics for you to track over the years will be the useful way to keep track of all this, and that's why I wanted to put out to you what are our average remaining term is for the Big 4 in aggregate and also what the churn rate for the nonnationals sort of assets in the Big 4, excluding the nonnational the assets of the Big 4 are. And I just said, it was 0.2%. So again, so far, with the industry conditions we expect to continue, it's a very, very low as far as actual turn off. But we'll keep providing those metrics as we move forward in time. Secondly, on the Indian market, it's a critical difference to be truly independent provider of [indiscernible] and any country versus a captive provider of siding, in other words, you're a subsidiary or affiliate of the mobile operator itself. Those contracts, I don't want to speak to, but I can speak to our contracts. With all mobile operators in India as being market-based and, therefore, arm's-length and certain provisions that may apply at captive contracts may or may not apply to ours. I just -- I guess I would set the foundation there because then we don't talk about specific contracts or discussions or negotiations in any of our markets. So that's I think a fundamental way to look at it is how do independence yield with mobile operators and how the captive is doing with mobile operators. And again, you can track our metrics over time in that regard."

I mean, the definitions which are on the release and the back of the slides that we have here. But I mean, the fundamental difference in the organic. We're really trying to, as we talked about last quarter, really trying to give a true run rate, a recurring run rate of build revenue. And so the tenant billings, if you will, that's recurring revenue that is constantly being invoiced to customers. Outside of that, we think it gets you to the reported or things like pass-through and straight-line and all those other elements, which had a lot of volatility from quarter to quarter. And then on an organic basis, what we really trying to do is again give you that recurring revenue that we have from colos amendments, plus escalators, less churn to give you a true view in terms of what the additional activity is happening on all of the sites that we have. So if you take a look at, for example, the U.S. in this particular quarter, if you exclude again the decommissioning revenue, which again was kind of again that volatile, now you're right in for the U.S., it's in the mid-5s, right about that 5.5% and versus the organic number that we talked about now under the tenant billings methodology of 5.6%. So it's very, very similar in terms of what the rates were that we talked about last quarter and that we would see in Q2. Similarly, for international, if you looked at the core organic growth, we're talking about 13.7% on the tenant billings organic basis, which is the number we just referred to. On the international side, again, if you backed up the impact of oil, we'll be right at 13.5%. So again, what we're trying to do is, we're trying to just reflect what that real run rate recurring billings stream would be. So very, very similar, just a couple of nuances in terms of the differences between the organic core growth and the tenant billings, the real differences being that decommissioning revenue in the U.S., which would be the kind of the major element to reconcile it to and the reserve that we took on the oi or on the Brazilian business in Brazil."

Regarding our small cell strategy overall, we've chosen to focus on indoor DAS systems and ultimately small cell systems as where we think the best returns have been can be attained. We're also actively exploring innovative ways to achieve tower-like returns on other what we call macro supplement type of assets, and that could be outdoor, small cells and other technologies that can better serve the high density I think the classic tower the macro tower is going to serve its purpose for the foreseeable future because we are really the business macro tower providing mobile service and suburban largely and corridor, transportation corridor and rural environment. And where a lot of small cell demand is coming, as you hear from the carriers and others, is in the really high-density locations such as urban centers where towers don't have a role, much of a role to play anyhow. So this could be a complementary business for us if we could figure out how to scale it, but importantly, how to scale it with tower-like returns. And that's what we're really aggressively exploring today, although I have to admit, we haven't solve the problem quite yet. And I think already you're seeing the issue with urban small cell deployments is have a big role in what gets built on their jurisdiction and how it gets built and if it's shared or single use. And so there are some municipal debates on some of the projects going on by all of the industry today. And we want to continue to work out all those issues as time goes on and figure out that if we can get tower-like returns from these kinds of projects. So it's going to be a long-cycle approach. 5G, even the standard won't be settled probably 2019, 2020, and they'll start being deployed in some of these dense venues. In the meantime, 4G that go to technology for at least the next 4 or 5 years and then another 5 to 10 beyond as you migrate to 5G. So I think we have some time to figure this out, but it is a knotty problem and we hope we can figure out to get out to get tower-like returns on the assets some day."

But the technology deployment in India is regarding right timing. We got a new entrant just the customer watching a national 4G network, which is going to, in some ways, leapfrog what's available today and also motivating the other market theaters to invest in 4G as well. So we see, as Tom said, sort of an up-cycle in technology investment in India at a scale that may have never been done before given the population in that country. Relatively over a few years, which has positioned us I think relatively well on the Viom acquisition as we kind of talk it now to ride that wave of technology investment. And there's some great companies involved. These are significant multinationals like Vodafone as well as 4G Airtel, as I mentioned, Reliance Industries, there's also Reliance Telecom. There's going to be some real competition from really moving quickly through 3G into 4G sort of technology territory. And as we all know, densification and equipment goes up as you go into the tire technology stack. So we're very optimistic about the technology kind of road map for the country. As far as volume, what was interesting about the Viom merger with ATC India was that our major customers happened to be the partners in this. So Airtel, Vodafone, Idea are very large customers of ATC, proportionately not as much actually of Viom where, of course, Tata was the core customer there. So we've got a complementary opportunity when we put these 2 assets together to drive volume in both directions, which I think is really going to be great for leasing for our market again over the next number of years and will play out. And then finally, pricing, I think it's miscasting that our pricing was lower than the [indiscernible] we tend to drive as high as we can without being tethered to the parent, and that's been I think a fairly successful endeavor. But we do have this the in the context of the overall market and certainly don't overprice, but I would say that we're probably on the upper end of pricing given our independence and the quality of our assets and finally, our ability to do construction jobs quickly in a difficult place."

From a P&L perspective, I think you can see from the release and from our supplemental that you can you recognize just how that revenue is recognized, and it's being recognized over the balance of the lease. And you can see that even on the quarter-over-quarter basis, I think the number is around $20 million, almost identical to what it was same quarter of last year. So that number continues to be fairly consistent on an annual basis. There's not a lot of volatility, not a lot of growth, not a lot of decline in it. As we continue to invest in those types of systems, we're actually getting capital contributions. So I look at it from 2 perspectives. One is just on the ROI, whether the transaction make sense, it just goes into the Math to determine whether a particular project meets our internal thresholds to be able to move forward with it. And then the recognition of that particular revenue is then over the remaining balance of the lease term."

Good morning, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter earnings.
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the second quarter 2016 as well as our full year outlook for the full year of 2016. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on our international business and strategy. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations for future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factories set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. I'd like to note that we have updated the name of our run rate revenue metric to tenant billing. As we highlighted for you last quarter when we introduced this metric, it reflects the current tenant billings, which are generated by our global portfolio of communications real estate.
In addition, in response to recently issued disclosure guidance by the SEC, after today, we will no longer reference our core growth metrics.
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.43 billion. Total revenues grew approximately 23% to over $1.44 billion, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 24% to $161 million or $0.37 per diluted common share.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was over 18% and included an income tax reserve related to our Viom transaction. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate will be in the low double digit. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter grew 14% to approximately $869 million and consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by over 10% to approximately $592 million or $1.38 per diluted share.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
24766,370254868,1015464,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone.

As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also declared a common stock dividend of $0.53 a share, which was up over 20% from the prior year period. And given the close of our Viom transaction in late April, our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate more than 42,000 towers we added to our portfolio with that acquisition.
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we generated strong performance with total reported property revenue growth of about 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 23%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent demand levels throughout our global footprint.
Our total property revenue growth this quarter included a negative 60 basis point impact from a $7 million revenue reserve related to receivables associated with a tenant in Brazil, which were outstanding at the time of their judicial reorganization filing. Based on our prior experiences with carrier bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings, we expect to pursue the full amount owed to us. Additionally, I would note that this tenant has resumed payments to us for amounts owed subsequent to their judicial reorganization filing date.
Our U.S. property segment generated total reported revenue growth of about 3%, including a negative 1.4% impact from straight-line revenue account recognition. We did not book any decommissioning revenue this quarter as compared to about $8 million recorded in Q2 of last year and $31 million or so booked in Q1. This negatively impacted our U.S. property revenue growth by an additional 1.1%.
U.S. organic tenant billings growth for the quarter was 5.6%, which again reflects organic build recurring revenue and was right in line with our expectations. Demand trends in the U.S. remain very steady with carriers actively spending to augment their 4G networks. Our international markets generated organic tenant billings growth of 13.7% or 800 basis points higher than that of the U.S. Escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributed about 7% to that growth, while organic new business commencements were even larger component of the growth at about 7.6%. These were partially offset by some churn of just over 1%.
There was broad strength across our international property segments with all 3 posting double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates, including 12% in Latin America, 20% in EMEA and over 10% in Asia. Our multinational tenant base in these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to advance headsets -- handsets at lower per unit cost and begin to use exponentially more data on those handsets. The benefits of the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model continues to be evidenced by the strong growth rates we are generating in our international markets.
Finally, on a total property basis, the day one revenue associated with the nearly 57,000 sites we have added since the second quarter of last year, including the Viom, Airtel Nigeria and TIM Brazil portfolios and roughly 3,400 new builds contributed another 15% to our total tenant billings growth in Q2, bringing the total growth to the nearly 23%. Our newbuild program remains active, and we constructed nearly 400 towers this quarter with an average day one NOI yield of over 10%.
Moving on to Slide 7. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Gross margin in the quarter remained strong at over 68% despite a negative impact of over 10% from pass-through and a negative impact of 4.6% due to the addition of new sites, which have lower initial tenancies and margins. This was supported by strong conversion of revenue to gross margin on legacy sites during the quarter, while our reported conversion of revenue to gross margin was around 49% as a result of the previously mentioned negative impacts of pass-through revenue and lower-tenancy new sites, which on a combined basis negatively impacted the reported conversion ratio by about 50%. Our ability to convert revenue to gross margin on our pre-existing sites remain strong and in line with historical norms of well over 90%.
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60% for the quarter, which includes a negative impact from pass-through of about 9%. This also includes about 4.3% of margin dilution associated with new sites brought into the portfolio since the start of the second quarter of last year, including Viom. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue was about 8.1% in the quarter and is expected to be right around 8% for the full year.
Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to about $869 million as a result of our top line growth, coupled with the diligent operational expense management. Our solid adjusted EBITDA performance drove growth in consolidated AFFO as it's slightly lower-than-expected capital improvement and capital expenditures. This led to growth in consolidated AFFO of over 10% and growth in consolidated AFFO per share of nearly 10%. The global operational efficiency initiatives that we put into place continue to result in strong profitability for the business.
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with financial policies designed to support this objective by managing risk across the capital structure in support of our investment-grade rating. In the second quarter, we pursued several financing initiatives directly supporting these policies. First, we raised $1 billion in 10-year senior unsecured notes at a historically low coupon rate for ATC of 3.375%. This opportunistic transaction increased our liquidity and turned out a significant portion of our floating rate debt.
Next, we assume nearly $800 million of rupee-denominated debt in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in Viom. We immediately commenced a multiyear process to refinance the existing loans locally at more attractive rates than the initial 11% average coupon. They have already decreased the average cost to about 10.3%. These actions highlight our excellent access to diversify funding sources, including the investment-grade volume market as well as an ability to maintain a substantial base of liquidity to support our solid balance sheet. As a result, as of the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 5.3x net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below. And longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3 and 5x.
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid performance in the first half of the year, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and underlying trends that are consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016. At the midpoint of our outlook, we're increasing our expectations for property revenue by $10 million or about 0.2%, resulting in projected reported growth of 21% or so. The increase is being driven by a $14 million increase in straight-line revenue and $7 million in favorability in organic tenant billing revenue across our property segment. This favorability is being partially offset by about $7 million from the reserve book this quarter in Brazil as well as about $4 million associated with lower expected pass-through revenue.
The positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations versus our prior outlook for revenue is just about $1 million, given that the devaluation of naira is offsetting the strengthening of the majority of our other currencies. Also, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from any of our pending transactions that have yet to close.
Within our total revenue projections, we expect in the U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.5% to 6% for the year. This reflects a steady demand environment similar to what we have seen year-to-date and anticipated acceleration in our growth rate in the second half of the year as a result of a more even spread of new business commencements compared to the prior year period.
Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of nearly 14% supported by especially strong trends in markets like Mexico, Nigeria and Uganda, where new business commencement activity is incredibly strong. At consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Newly-acquired and build sites are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year or just over 14%. This growth has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now on a consolidated basis stand at nearly $32 billion, with an average remaining lease term of about 5.6 years.
We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. This reflects cash SG&A as a percent of total revenue of right around 8%. Our increased adjusted EBITDA outlook is driven by an $8 million benefit associated with increased net straight-line, $17 million in FX favorability and about $6 million in outperformance in the underlying property business relative to our previous expectations. This is being partially offset by $7 million receivable reserve booked in Q2 and about $9 million in lower expected contribution from our services segment versus our prior outlook, where the pipeline of project-based activity has slowed. Given that substantially all of our Nigerian OpEx and SG&A expenses are denominated in local currency and that over half of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, the impact of the Nigerian Naira devaluation I referenced earlier to EBITDA is minimal.
Finally, we're raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $15 million at the midpoint or about 0.6%. This is being driven primarily by the $7 million increase in cash EBITDA, just discussed, plus roughly $13 million due to lower net cash interest expense expectations. This increase of $20 million is being partially offset by about $5 million resulting from higher expectations for corporate capital expenditures, primarily associated with IT spending to support our global operations. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.69 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of about 12%.
Before we move on, I'd also like to note that factoring in the July month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of about $33 million for property revenue, $18 million for adjusted EBITDA and $14 million for consolidated AFFO or about $0.03 per share relative to the midpoints of our current outlook.
Turning to Slide 11. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we've declared nearly $500 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends, spent approximately $1.2 billion on accretive acquisitions and deployed nearly $330 million in CapEx so far this year, which includes nearly $76 million spent on ground lease purchases. In fact, since 2011, we've deployed over $500 million for ground lease purchases in the U.S., while increasing the percentage of towers on land we owned or control for over 20 years from about 55% in 2011 to nearly 67% today and extending the average remaining term on our lease land from just under 22 years to nearly 25 years. This activity further secures our long-term recurring cash flows while generating margin improvement and enhancing the operating leverage of our business through land rent expense reduction. We expect to continue deploying capital for land purchases over the long term and are targeting to have 80% of our towers in the U.S. on land that is either owned or leased for more than 20 years by 2020.
We believe that our disciplined capital allocation strategy will enable us to deliver the combination of growth in consolidated AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions and drive compelling total returns for many years to come. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our dividend subject to board approval of at least 20%.
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we've enhanced our strategic positioning so far in 2016 by continuing to employ a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy. First, we further diversified our international presence by acquiring a controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. We believe mobile networks there poised for significant 4G investments in urban metros and for continuing deployment of coverage and initial data services in the suburban and rural areas where over 2/3 of Indians live.
Second, we've continued to drive operational excellence through our business while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios in several key markets. And third, we remained focused on strengthening our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing and selected debt repayments. And fourth, we've simultaneously maintained strong growth in our common stock dividend. As a result, we're well positioned to finish this year strong, driving compelling growth in revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO while returning significant cash to our shareholders through our common stock dividend. This is all made possible by our unmatched global scale, experienced regional leadership teams and disciplined capital allocation strategy, which we expect to remain consistent for the rest of this year and well into the future.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated a",1042,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated another strong quarter of operating results in Q2, once again serving as a turbocharger for our market-leading domestic business.
Beginning with American Tower's first international investment in Mexico in 1999, we methodically expanded our geographic scope and scale based on the set of fundamental tenants. First, we recognized that the power of the tower business model that has first been developed in the United States should equally apply in additional countries that presented the right operating conditions. It is our experience that due to a number of common factors, the fundamental drivers of tower demand are consistent across our selected geographies.
First, consumers everywhere have a huge appetite for mobile technology and service. And moreover, the underlying physics of radio wave propagation, usable spectrum bands and the 2G, 3G and 4G technology standards all apply globally. Plus, the network equipment on the OEMs, the handset manufacturers such as Apple and the chipset developers like QUALCOMM sell their products all over the world.
Second, we understood from our U.S. experience that by buying towers from mobile operators, we could transform single-use, nonperforming cost-center assets into high-performing, multiuse commercial real estate. Consequently, sale leaseback transactions for these assets provide an additional source of capital to mobile operators, so they could more rapidly deploy their active networks and grow their core business. Again, since these common sense economics apply across multiple countries, we've been able to pursue the same strategy successfully to date in Latin America, Africa, Germany and India.
And third, we recognized that we did dramatically increase our growth opportunities while at the same time, benefiting from the diversity across various markets. Using standard portfolio theory, we expected that by selectively diversifying our asset base, we could also reduce fluctuations in our cash flows, thereby delivering an elevated, extended and more stable growth trajectory over a very long period of time.
The results we have generated in our international markets confirm these principles. For example, on sites outside the U.S. that we've owned since the beginning of 2010, our U.S. dollar equivalent NOI yield as of the end of the second quarter was more than 30% as compared to around 18% on net vintage in the U.S. These results include both sites that we have acquired as part of our disciplined asset acquisition strategy and sites that we've constructed for our carrier customers.
Meanwhile, international sites added between 2010 and 2013 are already yielding around 12% today, with sites added over the last few years already yielding an average of about 10%. While the yields on our younger international assets are solid, we believe the real opportunities to make value on these newer assets lies ahead.
Our 2 decades of experience in the tower business have clearly illustrated that the longer we have assets in our portfolio, the more revenue and cash flow they generate. This is especially true outside the U.S., where most of our newly added sites have been single tenant at the time of acquisition or construction. Given that we have generated double-digit international organic tenant billings growth on average over the last 3 years and expect to continue to drive these types of solid growth rates going forward, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to drive significant NOI yield accretion on our international assets over time.
Consequently, we have positioned the company for continuing long-term success with our combined domestic U.S. and global asset base. MIT researchers, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have identified 3 key elements to building competitive advantage in the digital age: physical capital, intellectual capital and organizational capital. On all 3 of these dimensions, American Tower now has built a sustainable global competitive advantage in telecommunications real estate, which we believe would be difficult to replicate.
First is our physical capital. The 140,000-plus towers in small cell systems that we've constructed and acquired. Their high structural capacity, premier locations and existing and future cash flow generation potential. The depth, diversity and global reach of this physical capital are, in our view, unmatched. And we believe that replicating our portfolio while achieving similar economics in the future would be a very formidable task.
Second is the intellectual capital we have cultivated at American Tower since the mid-1990s. The systems and processes that we've developed, refined and optimized to be able to support tens of thousands of properties spanning in 5 continents, and it positions the company for further asset growth in the future. I actually believe that ATC is world-class in the most critical operational skills in this business, formulating highly complex master lease agreement tailored to our customers' needs, coupled with the ability to manage literally hundreds of thousands of individual tenant and ground leases every month.
And third is the organizational capital though that has been nurtured and developed at all levels in this company. I believe we have the most capable senior management team in the industry that have in turn built high-performance organizations in our key functions across all of our geographies. Our retention of highly skilled executives, managers and employees has been excellent, resulting in an experienced workforce today. Additionally, as a recognized global leader, American Tower's brand enables us to recruit outstanding talent to support the rapid growth of the business. We've also developed comprehensive training and development programs targeted to continually improve our capabilities and proprietary skills such as structural engineering and lease contracting.
So as a result of building our physical, intellectual and organizational capital methodically over the past 20 years, we've obtained a leadership position among fully independent tower companies in each of the leading 3-market democracies on the 5 most populous continents in the world, while creating a cash flow engine that continues to gather momentum. With our unique and dynamic position in this telecommunications real estate business, we expect to provide an attractive combination of growth and yield to our investors for many, many years to come.
Thank you for joining our call this morning, and operator, please open it up now for questions."

And how you think the trajectory of the business should turn over the next 12 months? And then I guess within that, during the quarter, I feel like there's been a lot of questions or conversations about how to think about future escalator rates in the U.S. with perhaps some of the carriers expressing some consternation about how the compounding growth outlook of that cost structure would be for them? Maybe you can provide us with some insight on what you're hearing from your conversations with carriers? And whether you believe there's either a risk or perhaps middle ground going forward?"

Now we can sort of see the trend of the business as far as duration and falloff. So for 2016, our expected remaining term for the 4 nationals is 6.6 years, and the churn is only approximately 0.2%. So we feel very confident about the stability of our U.S. domestic sort of Big 4 asset base or revenue base right now. And the other piece of that is the escalator, which across the U.S. on average is still above 3%. So I'll turn it over to Tom."

And so as we've always talked about, we see this amendment in colo activity in the form of sine waves. And so we fully believe that all the carriers are generating their own sine wave in terms of new business, grooming, colos and amendments.

Just maybe this is for you, Jim or Tom. Just following up on the early question. The T-Mobile and AT&T, I think you pretty explicitly gone out there and tried to solicit alternatives for macrocell sites that have been compounding for maybe 10 or even 20 years, and there's conceivably a window for economic substitution for new tower builds. Could you talk about what you see is the vulnerability of AMT's domestic portfolio in terms of long-term leases that have compounded with terms of leases that are expiring with alternative sightings that might be nearby? It doesn't seem like it could be very big, but I'm wondering if you see it at all as a potential vulnerability at this stage? And then second, in India, obviously, Bharti Infratel has been talking about the potential for resetting lease -- pricing lower at the end of the term of some of their main shareholder leases. Obviously, with Viom, you're going to have a larger overlap with them. I was wondering if you could talk about kind of the outlook for market lease pricing in India going forward?"

What I would say about potential substitution anywhere for towers is that, just to remind you, you all know the functional inputs of the franchise value of the tower. And so first of all, any change of equipment from one tower to another one, assuming you could even build that nearby, is fairly costly for any operator. So that's something they've to put into their equation. Also, the longer the site has been up, the more equipment tends to be on it, et cetera, and the more embedded is in the network. So there are some network difficulties and economic cost to doing a switch. But as you know, the other part of the franchise value is that most municipalities try to manage the number of structures in their jurisdiction, and we'd take that into account. And then thirdly, we continually try to reach mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers that can ameliorate the impact of specific high-priced sites as far as the contract. So we'll continue to help them as we can in that way as well. So I do think that having some metrics for you to track over the years will be a useful way to keep track of all this. And that's why I wanted to put out to you what are our average remaining term is for the Big 4 in aggregate and also what the churn rate for the nonnational sort of assets of the Big 4, excluding the nonnational the assets of the Big 4 are. And as I just said, it's 0.2%. So again, so far, with the industry conditions we expect to continue, it's very, very low as far as actual churn off. But we'll keep providing you those metrics as we go forward in time. Secondly, on the Indian market, it's a critical difference to be a truly independent provider of siting on any country versus a captive provider siting, in other words, you're a subsidiary or affiliate of the mobile operator itself. Those contracts, I don't want to speak to, but I can speak to our contracts. With all mobile operators in India as being market-based and, therefore, arm's length and certain provisions that may apply to captive contracts may or may not apply to ours. Just, I guess, I would set the foundation there, because we don't talk about specific contracts or discussions or negotiations in any of our markets. So that's again, I think, a fundamental way to look at it is how do independence deal with mobile operators and how do captives deal with mobile operators. And again, you can track our metrics over time in that regard."

I mean, the definitions are generally in the release and in the back of the slides that we have here. But I mean, the fundamental difference in the organic, we're really trying to -- as we talk about last quarter, really trying to give a true run rate, a recurring run rate of build revenue. And so the tenant billings, if you will, that recurring revenue that is constantly being invoiced to customers. Outside of that, which then gets you to the reported or things like pass-through and straight-line and all those other elements, which had a lot of volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And then on an organic basis, what we're really trying to do is again give you that recurring revenue that we have from colos, amendments plus escalators, less churn to give you a true view in terms of what the additional activity is happening on all of the sites that we have. So if you take a look at, for example, the U.S. in this particular quarter, if you'll exclude again the decommissioning revenue, which again was kind of again that volatile, now you're right in for the U.S., it's in the mid-5s, right in about that 5.5% and versus the organic number that we talked about now under the tenant billings methodology of 5.6%. So it's very, very similar in terms of what the rates were that we talked about last quarter and that we would see in Q2. Similarly, for international, if you looked at the core organic growth, we're talking about 13.7% on the tenant billings organic basis, which is the number we just referred to. On the international side, again, if you backed out the impact of oil, we'll be right at 13.5%. So again, what we're trying to do is, we're trying to just reflect what that real run rate recurring billing stream would be. So very, very similar, just a couple of nuances in terms of the differences between the organic core growth and the tenant billings. The real differences being that decommissioning revenue in the U.S., which would be the kind of the major element to reconcile it to and the reserve that we took on the oi or on the Brazilian business in Brazil."

Regarding our small cell strategy overall, we've chosen to focus on indoor DAS systems and ultimately indoor small cell systems as where we think the best returns have and can be attained. We're also actively exploring innovative ways to achieve tower-like returns on other what we call macro supplement type of assets, and that could be outdoor small cells and other technologies that can better serve the high density venues. I think the classic tower, the macro tower is going to serve its purpose for the foreseeable future, because we are really in the business in the macro tower world is providing mobile service and suburban largely and corridor -- transportation corridor and rural environments. And where a lot of the small cell demand is coming, as you hear from the carriers and others, is in the really high-density locations such as urban centers where towers don't have a role -- much of a role to play anyhow. So this could be a complementary business for us if we could figure out how to scale it, but importantly, how to scale it with tower-like returns. And that's what we're really aggressively exploring today, although I have to admit we haven't solved the problem quite yet. And I think already you're seeing that part of the issue with urban small cell deployments is [indiscernible] lease again have a big role and what gets built on their jurisdiction and how it gets built and if it's shared or single use. And so there are some municipal delays on some of the projects going on by all of the industry today. And we want to continue to work out all those issues as time goes on and figure out if we can get tower-like returns from these kinds of projects. So it's going to be a long-cycle approach. 5G, even a standard won't be settled probably 2019, 2020. And then, they'll start being deployed in some of these dense venues. In the meantime, 4G is that go-to technology for at least the next 4 or 5 years and then another 5 to 10 beyond if you migrate to 5G. So I don't think we have some time to figure this out, but it is a knotty problem and we hope we can figure out a way to get tower-like returns on a complementary asset some day."

But the technology deployment in India is for [indiscernible] right? I mean, we got a new entrant just on the customer watching national 4G network, which is going to -- in some way is leapfrog what's available today and also motivating the other market leaders to invest in 4G as well. So we see, as Tom said, sort of an up-cycle in technology investment in India at a scale that may have never been done before given the population in that country. And that will be over a few years, which has positioned us I think really well with the Viom acquisition as we kind of tucked in now to ride that wave of technology investment. And there's some great companies involved here. These are significant multinationals like Vodafone as well as Bharti Airtel, as I mentioned, Reliance Industries. There's also Reliance Telecom. There is going to be some real competition from really moving quickly through 3G into 4G sort of technology territory. And as we all know, densification and siting equipment needs to go up as you go into that higher technology stack. So we're very optimistic about the technology kind of road map for the country. As far as volume, what was interesting about the Viom merger with ATC India was that our major customers happened to be the partners in this. So again, Airtel, Vodafone, Idea are very large customers of ATC, proportionately not so much actually of Viom where, of course, Tata was the core customer there. So we got very complementary opportunity when we put these 2 assets together to drive volume in both directions, which I think is really going to be great for leasing for our market, again over the next number of years it will play out. And then finally, pricing, I think it's miscasting that our pricing is lower than the cap as our pricing we tend to drive as high as we can without being tethered to the parent, and that's been I think a fairly successful endeavor. But we do have to stay in the context of the overall market and certainly don't overprice. But I would say that we're probably on the upper end of pricing given our independence and the quality of our assets and finally, our ability to do construction jobs quickly and in a difficult places."

How it affects the cash flow? And how would you think about the valuation of assets and the return on your assets between the cash versus some of the noncash contribution in the income statement?"

I mean, that's just a discounted cash flow. From a P&L perspective, I think you can see from the release and from our -- of our supplemental that you can -- you recognize just how that revenue is being recognized, and it's being recognized over the balance of the lease. And you can see that even on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I think the number is around $20 million. It was almost identical to what it was same quarter of last year. So that number continues to be fairly consistent on an annual basis. There's not a lot of volatility, not a lot of growth, not a lot of decline in it. As we continue to invest in those types of systems, we're actually getting capital contributions. So I look at it from 2 perspectives. One is just on the ROI, whether the transaction makes sense, it just goes into the math to determine whether a particular project meets our internal thresholds to be able to move forward with it. And then the recognition of that particular revenue is down over the remaining balance of the lease term."

Good morning, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter earnings.
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the second quarter 2016 as well as our full year outlook for the full year of 2016. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on our international business and strategy. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations for future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. I'd like to note that we have updated the name of our run rate revenue metric to tenant billing. As we highlighted for you last quarter when we introduced this metric, it reflects the current tenant billings, which are generated by our global portfolio of communications real estate.
In addition, in response to recently issued disclosure guidance by the SEC, after today, we will no longer reference our core growth metrics.
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.43 billion. Total revenues grew approximately 23% to over $1.44 billion, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 24% to $161 million or $0.37 per diluted common share.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was over 18% and included an income tax reserve related to our Viom transaction. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate will be in the low double digits. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter grew 14% to approximately $869 million and consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by over 10% to approximately $592 million or $1.38 per diluted share.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
24766,370254868,1015671,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone.

As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also declared a common stock dividend of $0.53 a share, which was up over 20% from the prior year period. And given the close of our Viom transaction in late April, our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate more than 42,000 towers we added to our portfolio with that acquisition.
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we generated strong performance with total reported property revenue growth of about 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 23%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent demand levels throughout our global footprint.
Our total property revenue growth this quarter included a negative 60 basis point impact from a $7 million revenue reserve related to receivables associated with a tenant in Brazil, which were outstanding at the time of their judicial reorganization filing. Based on our prior experiences with carrier bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings, we expect to pursue the full amount owed to us. Additionally, I would note that this tenant has resumed payments to us for amounts owed subsequent to their judicial reorganization filing date.
Our U.S. property segment generated total reported revenue growth of about 3%, including a negative 1.4% impact from straight-line revenue account recognition. We did not book any decommissioning revenue this quarter as compared to about $8 million recorded in Q2 of last year and $31 million or so booked in Q1. This negatively impacted our U.S. property revenue growth by an additional 1.1%.
U.S. organic tenant billings growth for the quarter was 5.6%, which again reflects organic build recurring revenue and was right in line with our expectations. Demand trends in the U.S. remain very steady with carriers actively spending to augment their 4G networks. Our international markets generated organic tenant billings growth of 13.7% or 800 basis points higher than that of the U.S. Escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributed about 7% to that growth, while organic new business commencements were even larger component of the growth at about 7.6%. These were partially offset by some churn of just over 1%.
There was broad strength across our international property segments with all 3 posting double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates, including 12% in Latin America, 20% in EMEA and over 10% in Asia. Our multinational tenant base in these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to advance headsets -- handsets at lower per unit cost and begin to use exponentially more data on those handsets. The benefits of the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model continues to be evidenced by the strong growth rates we are generating in our international markets.
Finally, on a total property basis, the day one revenue associated with the nearly 57,000 sites we have added since the second quarter of last year, including the Viom, Airtel Nigeria and TIM Brazil portfolios and roughly 3,400 new builds contributed another 15% to our total tenant billings growth in Q2, bringing the total growth to the nearly 23%. Our newbuild program remains active, and we constructed nearly 400 towers this quarter with an average day one NOI yield of over 10%.
Moving on to Slide 7. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Gross margin in the quarter remained strong at over 68% despite a negative impact of over 10% from pass-through and a negative impact of 4.6% due to the addition of new sites, which have lower initial tenancies and margins. This was supported by strong conversion of revenue to gross margin on legacy sites during the quarter, while our reported conversion of revenue to gross margin was around 49% as a result of the previously mentioned negative impacts of pass-through revenue and lower-tenancy new sites, which on a combined basis negatively impacted the reported conversion ratio by about 50%. Our ability to convert revenue to gross margin on our pre-existing sites remain strong and in line with historical norms of well over 90%.
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60% for the quarter, which includes a negative impact from pass-through of about 9%. This also includes about 4.3% of margin dilution associated with new sites brought into the portfolio since the start of the second quarter of last year, including Viom. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue was about 8.1% in the quarter and is expected to be right around 8% for the full year.
Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to about $869 million as a result of our top line growth, coupled with the diligent operational expense management. Our solid adjusted EBITDA performance drove growth in consolidated AFFO as it's slightly lower-than-expected capital improvement and capital expenditures. This led to growth in consolidated AFFO of over 10% and growth in consolidated AFFO per share of nearly 10%. The global operational efficiency initiatives that we put into place continue to result in strong profitability for the business.
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with financial policies designed to support this objective by managing risk across the capital structure in support of our investment-grade rating. In the second quarter, we pursued several financing initiatives directly supporting these policies. First, we raised $1 billion in 10-year senior unsecured notes at a historically low coupon rate for ATC of 3.375%. This opportunistic transaction increased our liquidity and turned out a significant portion of our floating rate debt.
Next, we assume nearly $800 million of rupee-denominated debt in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in Viom. We immediately commenced a multiyear process to refinance the existing loans locally at more attractive rates than the initial 11% average coupon. They have already decreased the average cost to about 10.3%. These actions highlight our excellent access to diversified funding sources, including the investment-grade bond market as well as an ability to maintain a substantial base of liquidity to support our solid balance sheet. As a result, as of the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 5.3x net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below. And longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3 and 5x.
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid performance in the first half of the year, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and underlying trends that are consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016. At the midpoint of our outlook, we're increasing our expectations for property revenue by $10 million or about 0.2%, resulting in projected reported growth of 21% or so. The increase is being driven by a $14 million increase in straight-line revenue and $7 million in favorability in organic tenant billing revenue across our property segment. This favorability is being partially offset by about $7 million from the reserve book this quarter in Brazil as well as about $4 million associated with lower expected pass-through revenue.
The positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations versus our prior outlook for revenue is just about $1 million, given that the devaluation of the naira is offsetting the strengthening of the majority of our other currencies. Also, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from any of our pending transactions that have yet to close.
Within our total revenue projections, we expect in the U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.5% to 6% for the year. This reflects a steady demand environment similar to what we have seen year-to-date and anticipated acceleration in our growth rate in the second half of the year as a result of a more even spread of new business commencements compared to the prior year period.
Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of nearly 14% supported by especially strong trends in markets like Mexico, Nigeria and Uganda, where new business commencement activity is incredibly strong. At consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Newly-acquired and build sites are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year or just over 14%. This growth has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now on a consolidated basis stand at nearly $32 billion, with an average remaining lease term of about 5.6 years.
We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. This reflects cash SG&A as a percent of total revenue of right around 8%. Our increased adjusted EBITDA outlook is driven by an $8 million benefit associated with increased net straight-line, $17 million in FX favorability and about $6 million in outperformance in the underlying property business relative to our previous expectations. This is being partially offset by $7 million receivable reserve booked in Q2 and about $9 million in lower expected contribution from our services segment versus our prior outlook, where the pipeline of project-based activity has slowed. Given that substantially all of our Nigerian OpEx and SG&A expenses are denominated in local currency and that over half of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, the impact of the Nigerian Naira devaluation I referenced earlier to EBITDA is minimal.
Finally, we're raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $15 million at the midpoint or about 0.6%. This is being driven primarily by the $7 million increase in cash EBITDA, just discussed, plus roughly $13 million due to lower net cash interest expense expectations. This increase of $20 million is being partially offset by about $5 million resulting from higher expectations for corporate capital expenditures, primarily associated with IT spending to support our global operations. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.69 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of about 12%.
Before we move on, I'd also like to note that factoring in the July month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of about $33 million for property revenue, $18 million for adjusted EBITDA and $14 million for consolidated AFFO or about $0.03 per share relative to the midpoints of our current outlook.
Turning to Slide 11. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we've declared nearly $500 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends, spent approximately $1.2 billion on accretive acquisitions and deployed nearly $330 million in CapEx so far this year, which includes nearly $76 million spent on ground lease purchases. In fact, since 2011, we've deployed over $500 million for ground lease purchases in the U.S., while increasing the percentage of towers on land we owned or control for over 20 years from about 55% in 2011 to nearly 67% today and extending the average remaining term on our lease land from just under 22 years to nearly 25 years. This activity further secures our long-term recurring cash flows while generating margin improvement and enhancing the operating leverage of our business through land rent expense reduction. We expect to continue deploying capital for land purchases over the long term and are targeting to have 80% of our towers in the U.S. on land that is either owned or leased for more than 20 years by 2020.
We believe that our disciplined capital allocation strategy will enable us to deliver the combination of growth in consolidated AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions and drive compelling total returns for many years to come. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our dividend subject to board approval of at least 20%.
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we've enhanced our strategic positioning so far in 2016 by continuing to employ a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy. First, we further diversified our international presence by acquiring a controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. We believe mobile networks there poised for significant 4G investments in urban metros and for continuing deployment of coverage and initial data services in the suburban and rural areas where over 2/3 of Indians live.
Second, we've continued to drive operational excellence through our business while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios in several key markets. And third, we've remained focused on strengthening our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing and selected debt repayments. And fourth, we've simultaneously maintained strong growth in our common stock dividend. As a result, we're well positioned to finish this year strong, driving compelling growth in revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO while returning significant cash to our shareholders through our common stock dividend. This is all made possible by our unmatched global scale, experienced regional leadership teams and disciplined capital allocation strategy, which we expect to remain consistent for the rest of this year and well into the future.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated a",1040,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated another strong quarter of operating results in Q2, once again serving as a turbocharger for our market-leading domestic business.
Beginning with American Tower's first international investment in Mexico in 1999, we methodically expanded our geographic scope and scale based on the set of fundamental tenants. First, we recognized that the power of the tower business model that has first been developed in the United States should equally apply in additional countries that presented the right operating conditions. It is our experience that due to a number of common factors, the fundamental drivers of tower demand are consistent across our selected geographies.
First, consumers everywhere have a huge appetite for mobile technology and service. And moreover, the underlying physics of radio wave propagation, usable spectrum bands and the 2G, 3G and 4G technology standards all apply globally. Plus, the network equipment on the OEMs, the handset manufacturers such as Apple and the chipset developers like QUALCOMM sell their products all over the world.
Second, we understood from our U.S. experience that by buying towers from mobile operators, we could transform single-use, nonperforming cost-center assets into high-performing, multiuse commercial real estate. Consequently, sale leaseback transactions for these assets provide an additional source of capital to mobile operators, so they could more rapidly deploy their active networks and grow their core business. Again, since these common sense economics apply across multiple countries, we've been able to pursue the same strategy successfully to date in Latin America, Africa, Germany and India.
And third, we recognized that we could dramatically increase our growth opportunities while at the same time, benefiting from the diversity across various markets. Using standard portfolio theory, we expected that by selectively diversifying our asset base, we could also reduce fluctuations in our cash flows, thereby delivering an elevated, extended and more stable growth trajectory over a very long period of time.
The results we have generated in our international markets confirm these principles. For example, on sites outside the U.S. that we've owned since the beginning of 2010, our U.S. dollar equivalent NOI yield as of the end of the second quarter was more than 30% as compared to around 18% on net vintage in the U.S. These results include both sites that we have acquired as part of our disciplined asset acquisition strategy and sites that we've constructed for our carrier customers.
Meanwhile, international sites added between 2010 and 2013 are already yielding around 12% today, with sites added over the last few years already yielding an average of about 10%. While the yields on our younger international assets are solid, we believe the real opportunities to make value on these newer assets lies ahead.
Our 2 decades of experience in the tower business have clearly illustrated that the longer we have assets in our portfolio, the more revenue and cash flow they generate. This is especially true outside the U.S., where most of our newly added sites have been single tenant at the time of acquisition or construction. Given that we have generated double-digit international organic tenant billings growth on average over the last 3 years and expect to continue to drive these types of solid growth rates going forward, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to drive significant NOI yield accretion on our international assets over time.
Consequently, we have positioned the company for continuing long-term success with our combined domestic U.S. and global asset base. MIT researchers, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have identified 3 key elements to building competitive advantage in the digital age: physical capital, intellectual capital and organizational capital. On all 3 of these dimensions, American Tower now has built a sustainable global competitive advantage in telecommunications real estate, which we believe would be difficult to replicate.
First is our physical capital. The 140,000-plus towers in small cell systems that we've constructed and acquired. Their high structural capacity, premier locations and existing and future cash flow generation potential. The depth, diversity and global reach of this physical capital are, in our view, unmatched. And we believe that replicating our portfolio while achieving similar economics in the future would be a very formidable task.
Second is the intellectual capital we have cultivated at American Tower since the mid-1990s. The systems and processes that we've developed, refined and optimized to be able to support tens of thousands of properties spanning 5 continents, and it positions the company for further asset growth in the future. I actually believe that ATC is world-class in the most critical operational skills in this business, formulating highly complex master lease agreements tailored to our customers' needs, coupled with the ability to manage literally hundreds of thousands of individual tenant and ground leases every month.
And third is the organizational capital that has been nurtured and developed at all levels in this company. I believe we have the most capable senior management team in the industry who have in turn built high-performance organizations in our key functions across all of our geographies. Our retention of highly skilled executives, managers and employees has been excellent, resulting in an experienced workforce today. Additionally, as a recognized global leader, American Tower's brand enables us to recruit outstanding talent to support the rapid growth of the business. We've also developed comprehensive training and development programs targeted to continually improve our capabilities and proprietary skills such as structural engineering and lease contracting.
So as a result of building our physical, intellectual and organizational capital methodically over the past 20 years, we've obtained a leadership position among fully independent tower companies in each of the leading free-market democracies on the 5 most populous continents in the world, while creating a cash flow engine that continues to gather momentum. With our unique and dynamic position in the telecommunications real estate business, we expect to provide an attractive combination of growth and yield to our investors for many, many years to come.
Thank you for joining our call this morning, and operator, please open it up now for questions."

And how you think the trajectory of the business should turn over the next 12 months? And then I guess within that, during the quarter, I feel like there's been a lot of questions or conversations about how to think about future escalator rates in the U.S. with perhaps some of the carriers expressing some consternation about how the compounding growth outlook of that cost structure would be for them? Maybe you can provide us with some insight on what you're hearing from your conversations with carriers? And whether you believe there's either a risk or perhaps middle ground going forward?"

Now we can sort of see the trend of the business as far as duration and falloff. So for 2016, our expected remaining term for the 4 nationals is 6.6 years, and the churn is only approximately 0.2%. So we feel very confident about the stability of our U.S. domestic sort of Big 4 asset base or revenue base right now. And the other piece of that is the escalator, which across the U.S. on average is still above 3%. So I'll turn it over to Tom."

In the United States, I think you're well aware that over the last 3 quarters, it's been a large piece of amendment activity continually to filling in and meeting that capacity. And so as we've always talked about, we see this amendment in colo activity in the form of sine waves. And so we fully believe that all the carriers are generating their own sine wave in terms of new business, grooming, colos and amendments. And I think, as I mentioned, we see a more momentum coming even to the second half of the year, which we think will position us well then for going into 2017."

Just maybe this is for you, Jim or Tom. Just following up on the early question. The T-Mobile and AT&T, I think have pretty explicitly gone out there and tried to solicit alternatives for macrocell sites that have been compounding for maybe 10 or even 20 years, and there's conceivably a window for economic substitution for new tower builds. Could you talk about what you see is the vulnerability of AMT's domestic portfolio in terms of long-term leases that have compounded with terms of leases that are expiring with alternative sightings that might be nearby? It doesn't seem like it could be very big, but I'm wondering if you see it at all as a potential vulnerability at this stage? And then second, in India, obviously, Bharti Infratel has been talking about the potential for resetting lease -- pricing lower at the end of the term of some of their main shareholder leases. Obviously, with Viom, you're going to have a larger overlap with them. I was wondering if you could talk about kind of the outlook for market lease pricing in India going forward?"

What I would say about potential substitution anywhere for towers is that, just to remind you, you all know the functional inputs of the franchise value of the tower.

What I would say about potential substitution anywhere for towers is that, just to remind you, you all know the functional inputs of the franchise value of the tower. And so first of all, any change of equipment from one tower to another one, assuming you could even build it nearby, is fairly costly for any operator. So that's something they've to put into their equation. Also, the longer the site has been up, the more equipment tends to be on it, et cetera, and the more embedded it is in the network. So there are some network difficulties and economic costs to doing a switch. But as you know, the other part of the franchise value is that most municipalities try to manage the number of structures in their jurisdiction, and would take that into account. And then thirdly, we continually try to reach mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers that can ameliorate the impact of specific high-priced sites as far as the contract. So we'll continue to help them as we can in that way as well. So I do think that having some metrics for you to track over the years will be a useful way to keep track of all this. And that's why I wanted to put out to you what are our average remaining term is for the Big 4 in aggregate and also what the churn rate for the nonnational sort of assets of the Big 4, excluding the nonnational the assets of the Big 4 are. And as I just said, it's 0.2%. So again, so far, with the industry conditions we expect to continue, it's very, very low as far as actual churn off. But we'll keep providing you those metrics as we go forward in time. Secondly, on the Indian market, it's a critical difference to be a truly independent provider of siting on any country versus a captive provider siting, in other words, you're a subsidiary or affiliate of the mobile operator itself. Those contracts, I don't want to speak to, but I can speak to our contracts with all mobile operators in India as being market-based and, therefore, arm's length, and certain provisions that may apply to captive contracts may or may not apply to ours. Just, I guess, I would set the foundation there, because we don't talk about specific contracts or discussions or negotiations in any of our markets. So that's again, I think, a fundamental way to look at it is how do independents deal with mobile operators and how do captives deal with mobile operators. And again, you can track our metrics over time in that regard."

I mean, the definitions are generally in the release and in the back of the slides that we have here. But I mean, the fundamental difference in the organic, we're really trying to -- as we talk about last quarter, really trying to give a true run rate, a recurring run rate of build revenue. And so the tenant billings, if you will, that recurring revenue that is constantly being invoiced to customers. Outside of that, which then gets you to the reported are things like pass-through and straight-line and all those other elements, which had a lot of volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And then on an organic basis, what we're really trying to do is again give you that recurring revenue that we have from colos, amendments plus escalators, less churn to give you a true view in terms of what the additional activity is happening on all of the sites that we have. So if you take a look at, for example, the U.S. in this particular quarter, if you'll exclude again the decommissioning revenue, which again was kind of again that volatile, now you're right in for the U.S., it's in the mid-5s, right in about that 5.5% and versus the organic number that we talked about now under the tenant billings methodology of 5.6%. So it's very, very similar in terms of what the rates were that we talked about last quarter and that we would see in Q2. Similarly, for international, if you looked at the core organic growth, we're talking about 13.7% on the tenant billings organic basis, which is the number we just referred to. On the international side, again, if you backed out the impact of oi [ph] we'd be right at 13.5%. So again, what we're trying to do is, we're trying to just reflect what that real run rate recurring billing stream would be. So very, very similar, just a couple of nuances in terms of the differences between the organic core growth and the tenant billings. The real differences being that decommissioning revenue in the U.S., which would be the kind of the major element to reconcile it to and the reserve that we took on the oi or on the Brazilian business in Brazil."

Regarding our small cell strategy overall, we've chosen to focus on indoor DAS systems and ultimately indoor small cell systems as where we think the best returns have and can be attained. We're also actively exploring innovative ways to achieve tower-like returns on other what we call macro supplement types of assets, and that could be outdoor small cells and other technologies that can better serve the high density venues. I think the classic tower, the macro tower is going to serve its purpose for the foreseeable future, because we are really in the business of in the macro tower world is providing mobile service and suburban largely and corridor -- transportation corridor and rural environments. And where a lot of the small cell demand is coming, as you hear from the carriers and others, is in the really high-density locations such as urban centers where towers don't have a role -- much of a role to play anyhow. So this could be a complementary business for us if we could figure out how to scale it, but importantly, how to scale it with tower-like returns. And that's what we're really aggressively exploring today, although I have to admit we haven't solved the problem quite yet. And I think already you're seeing that part of the issue with urban small cell deployments is the municipalities, again, have a big role and what gets built on their jurisdiction and how it gets built and if it's shared or single use. And so there are some municipal delays on some of the projects going on by all of the industry today. And we want to continue to work out all those issues as time goes on and figure out if we can get tower-like returns from these kinds of projects. So it's going to be a long-cycle approach. 5G, even a standard won't be settled probably 2019, 2020. And then, they'll start being deployed in some of these dense venues. In the meantime, 4G is the go-to technology for at least the next 4 or 5 years and then another 5 to 10 beyond if you migrate to 5G. So I think we have some time to figure this out, but it is a knotty problem and we hope we can figure out a way to get tower-like returns on a complementary asset some day."

But the technology deployment in India is for [indiscernible] right? I mean, we got a new entrant just on the cusp of launching national 4G network, which is going to -- in some way is leapfrog what's available today and also motivating the other market leaders to invest in 4G as well. So we see, as Tom said, sort of an up-cycle in technology investment in India at a scale that may have never been done before given the population in that country. And that will be over a few years, which has positioned us I think really well with the Viom acquisition as we kind of tuck it in now to ride that wave of technology investment. And there's some great companies involved here. These are significant multinationals like Vodafone as well as Bharti Airtel, as I mentioned, Reliance Industries. There's also Reliance Telecom. There is going to be some real competition from really moving quickly through 3G into 4G sort of technology territory. And as we all know, densification and siting equipment needs go up as you go into that higher technology stack. So we're very optimistic about the technology kind of road map for the country. As far as volume, what was interesting about the Viom merger with ATC India was that our major customers happened to be the partners at Indus. So again, Airtel, Vodafone, Idea are very large customers of ATC, proportionately not so much actually of Viom where, of course, Tata was the core customer there. So we got very complementary opportunity when we put these 2 assets together to drive volume in both directions, which I think is really going to be great for leasing for our market, again over the next number of years it will play out. And then finally, pricing, I think it's miscasting that our pricing is lower than the cap as our pricing we tend to drive as high as we can without being tethered to the parent, and that's been I think a fairly successful endeavor. But we do have to stay in the context of the overall market and certainly don't overprice. But I would say that we're probably on the upper end of pricing given our independence and the quality of our assets and finally, our ability to do construction jobs quickly and in difficult places."

What hasn't occurred is the asset trading price meeting our investment criteria. It happened once in Germany, where we do have a really great base with the KPN assets now part of Telefónica. So we think we're firmly positioned with a great beachhead in the continent and continually strive to work negotiations, so that we can get our investment criteria met and invest more in the region. And so far, that combination just we have not been able to secure. And it mainly has to do with asset pricing and the characteristics of the market and the returns you'll get. So we are poised to just like with small cells, aggressively pursue assets that meet our investment criteria. If we can locate or determine those, we will act quickly and decisively. When we don't, we will avoid investing in what we consider at the time to be lower-return opportunities, frankly."

From a P&L perspective, I think you can see from the release and from our -- of our supplemental that you can -- you recognize just how that revenue is being recognized, and it's being recognized over the balance of the lease. And you can see that even on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I think the number is around $20 million. It was almost identical to what it was same quarter of last year. So that number continues to be fairly consistent on an annual basis. There's not a lot of volatility, not a lot of growth, not a lot of decline in it. As we continue to invest in those types of systems, where we're actually getting capital contributions. So I look at it from 2 perspectives. One is just on the ROI, whether the transaction makes sense, it just goes into the math to determine whether a particular project meets our internal thresholds to be able to move forward with it. And then the recognition of that particular revenue is down over the remaining balance of the lease term."

Good morning, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter earnings.
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the second quarter 2016 as well as our full year outlook for the full year of 2016. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on our international business and strategy. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations for future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. I'd like to note that we have updated the name of our run rate revenue metric to tenant billing. As we highlighted for you last quarter when we introduced this metric, it reflects the current tenant billings, which are generated by our global portfolio of communications real estate.
In addition, in response to recently issued disclosure guidance by the SEC, after today, we will no longer reference our core growth metrics.
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.43 billion. Total revenues grew approximately 23% to over $1.44 billion, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 24% to $161 million or $0.37 per diluted common share.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was over 18% and included an income tax reserve related to our Viom transaction. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate will be in the low double digits. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter grew 14% to approximately $869 million and consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by over 10% to approximately $592 million or $1.38 per diluted share.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
24766,370254868,1015677,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone.

As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also declared a common stock dividend of $0.53 a share, which was up over 20% from the prior year period. And given the close of our Viom transaction in late April, our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate more than 42,000 towers we added to our portfolio with that acquisition.
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we generated strong performance with total reported property revenue growth of about 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 23%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent demand levels throughout our global footprint.
Our total property revenue growth this quarter included a negative 60 basis point impact from a $7 million revenue reserve related to receivables associated with a tenant in Brazil, which were outstanding at the time of their judicial reorganization filing. Based on our prior experiences with carrier bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings, we expect to pursue the full amount owed to us. Additionally, I would note that this tenant has resumed payments to us for amounts owed subsequent to their judicial reorganization filing date.
Our U.S. property segment generated total reported revenue growth of about 3%, including a negative 1.4% impact from straight-line revenue account recognition. We did not book any decommissioning revenue this quarter as compared to about $8 million recorded in Q2 of last year and $31 million or so booked in Q1. This negatively impacted our U.S. property revenue growth by an additional 1.1%.
U.S. organic tenant billings growth for the quarter was 5.6%, which again reflects organic build recurring revenue and was right in line with our expectations. Demand trends in the U.S. remain very steady with carriers actively spending to augment their 4G networks. Our international markets generated organic tenant billings growth of 13.7% or 800 basis points higher than that of the U.S. Escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributed about 7% to that growth, while organic new business commencements were even larger component of the growth at about 7.6%. These were partially offset by some churn of just over 1%.
There was broad strength across our international property segments with all 3 posting double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates, including 12% in Latin America, 20% in EMEA and over 10% in Asia. Our multinational tenant base in these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to advance headsets -- handsets at lower per unit cost and begin to use exponentially more data on those handsets. The benefits of the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model continues to be evidenced by the strong growth rates we are generating in our international markets.
Finally, on a total property basis, the day one revenue associated with the nearly 57,000 sites we have added since the second quarter of last year, including the Viom, Airtel Nigeria and TIM Brazil portfolios and roughly 3,400 new builds contributed another 15% to our total tenant billings growth in Q2, bringing the total growth to the nearly 23%. Our newbuild program remains active, and we constructed nearly 400 towers this quarter with an average day one NOI yield of over 10%.
Moving on to Slide 7. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Gross margin in the quarter remained strong at over 68% despite a negative impact of over 10% from pass-through and a negative impact of 4.6% due to the addition of new sites, which have lower initial tenancies and margins. This was supported by strong conversion of revenue to gross margin on legacy sites during the quarter, while our reported conversion of revenue to gross margin was around 49% as a result of the previously mentioned negative impacts of pass-through revenue and lower-tenancy new sites, which on a combined basis negatively impacted the reported conversion ratio by about 50%. Our ability to convert revenue to gross margin on our pre-existing sites remain strong and in line with historical norms of well over 90%.
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60% for the quarter, which includes a negative impact from pass-through of about 9%. This also includes about 4.3% of margin dilution associated with new sites brought into the portfolio since the start of the second quarter of last year, including Viom. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue was about 8.1% in the quarter and is expected to be right around 8% for the full year.
Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to about $869 million as a result of our top line growth, coupled with the diligent operational expense management. Our solid adjusted EBITDA performance drove growth in consolidated AFFO as it's slightly lower-than-expected capital improvement and capital expenditures. This led to growth in consolidated AFFO of over 10% and growth in consolidated AFFO per share of nearly 10%. The global operational efficiency initiatives that we put into place continue to result in strong profitability for the business.
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with financial policies designed to support this objective by managing risk across the capital structure in support of our investment-grade rating. In the second quarter, we pursued several financing initiatives directly supporting these policies. First, we raised $1 billion in 10-year senior unsecured notes at a historically low coupon rate for ATC of 3.375%. This opportunistic transaction increased our liquidity and turned out a significant portion of our floating rate debt.
Next, we assume nearly $800 million of rupee-denominated debt in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in Viom. We immediately commenced a multiyear process to refinance the existing loans locally at more attractive rates than the initial 11% average coupon. They have already decreased the average cost to about 10.3%. These actions highlight our excellent access to diversified funding sources, including the investment-grade bond market as well as an ability to maintain a substantial base of liquidity to support our solid balance sheet. As a result, as of the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 5.3x net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below. And longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3 and 5x.
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid performance in the first half of the year, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and underlying trends that are consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016. At the midpoint of our outlook, we're increasing our expectations for property revenue by $10 million or about 0.2%, resulting in projected reported growth of 21% or so. The increase is being driven by a $14 million increase in straight-line revenue and $7 million in favorability in organic tenant billing revenue across our property segment. This favorability is being partially offset by about $7 million from the reserve book this quarter in Brazil as well as about $4 million associated with lower expected pass-through revenue.
The positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations versus our prior outlook for revenue is just about $1 million, given that the devaluation of the naira is offsetting the strengthening of the majority of our other currencies. Also, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from any of our pending transactions that have yet to close.
Within our total revenue projections, we expect in the U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.5% to 6% for the year. This reflects a steady demand environment similar to what we have seen year-to-date and anticipated acceleration in our growth rate in the second half of the year as a result of a more even spread of new business commencements compared to the prior year period.
Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of nearly 14% supported by especially strong trends in markets like Mexico, Nigeria and Uganda, where new business commencement activity is incredibly strong. At consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Newly-acquired and build sites are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year or just over 14%. This growth has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now on a consolidated basis stand at nearly $32 billion, with an average remaining lease term of about 5.6 years.
We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. This reflects cash SG&A as a percent of total revenue of right around 8%. Our increased adjusted EBITDA outlook is driven by an $8 million benefit associated with increased net straight-line, $17 million in FX favorability and about $6 million in outperformance in the underlying property business relative to our previous expectations. This is being partially offset by $7 million receivable reserve booked in Q2 and about $9 million in lower expected contribution from our services segment versus our prior outlook, where the pipeline of project-based activity has slowed. Given that substantially all of our Nigerian OpEx and SG&A expenses are denominated in local currency and that over half of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, the impact of the Nigerian Naira devaluation I referenced earlier to EBITDA is minimal.
Finally, we're raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $15 million at the midpoint or about 0.6%. This is being driven primarily by the $7 million increase in cash EBITDA, just discussed, plus roughly $13 million due to lower net cash interest expense expectations. This increase of $20 million is being partially offset by about $5 million resulting from higher expectations for corporate capital expenditures, primarily associated with IT spending to support our global operations. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.69 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of about 12%.
Before we move on, I'd also like to note that factoring in the July month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of about $33 million for property revenue, $18 million for adjusted EBITDA and $14 million for consolidated AFFO or about $0.03 per share relative to the midpoints of our current outlook.
Turning to Slide 11. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we've declared nearly $500 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends, spent approximately $1.2 billion on accretive acquisitions and deployed nearly $330 million in CapEx so far this year, which includes nearly $76 million spent on ground lease purchases. In fact, since 2011, we've deployed over $500 million for ground lease purchases in the U.S., while increasing the percentage of towers on land we owned or control for over 20 years from about 55% in 2011 to nearly 67% today and extending the average remaining term on our lease land from just under 22 years to nearly 25 years. This activity further secures our long-term recurring cash flows while generating margin improvement and enhancing the operating leverage of our business through land rent expense reduction. We expect to continue deploying capital for land purchases over the long term and are targeting to have 80% of our towers in the U.S. on land that is either owned or leased for more than 20 years by 2020.
We believe that our disciplined capital allocation strategy will enable us to deliver the combination of growth in consolidated AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions and drive compelling total returns for many years to come. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our dividend subject to board approval of at least 20%.
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we've enhanced our strategic positioning so far in 2016 by continuing to employ a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy. First, we further diversified our international presence by acquiring a controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. We believe mobile networks there poised for significant 4G investments in urban metros and for continuing deployment of coverage and initial data services in the suburban and rural areas where over 2/3 of Indians live.
Second, we've continued to drive operational excellence through our business while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios in several key markets. And third, we've remained focused on strengthening our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing and selected debt repayments. And fourth, we've simultaneously maintained strong growth in our common stock dividend. As a result, we're well positioned to finish this year strong, driving compelling growth in revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO while returning significant cash to our shareholders through our common stock dividend. This is all made possible by our unmatched global scale, experienced regional leadership teams and disciplined capital allocation strategy, which we expect to remain consistent for the rest of this year and well into the future.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated a",1040,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated another strong quarter of operating results in Q2, once again serving as a turbocharger for our market-leading domestic business.
Beginning with American Tower's first international investment in Mexico in 1999, we methodically expanded our geographic scope and scale based on the set of fundamental tenants. First, we recognized that the power of the tower business model that has first been developed in the United States should equally apply in additional countries that presented the right operating conditions. It is our experience that due to a number of common factors, the fundamental drivers of tower demand are consistent across our selected geographies.
First, consumers everywhere have a huge appetite for mobile technology and service. And moreover, the underlying physics of radio wave propagation, usable spectrum bands and the 2G, 3G and 4G technology standards all apply globally. Plus, the network equipment on the OEMs, the handset manufacturers such as Apple and the chipset developers like QUALCOMM sell their products all over the world.
Second, we understood from our U.S. experience that by buying towers from mobile operators, we could transform single-use, nonperforming cost-center assets into high-performing, multiuse commercial real estate. Consequently, sale leaseback transactions for these assets provide an additional source of capital to mobile operators, so they could more rapidly deploy their active networks and grow their core business. Again, since these common sense economics apply across multiple countries, we've been able to pursue the same strategy successfully to date in Latin America, Africa, Germany and India.
And third, we recognized that we could dramatically increase our growth opportunities while at the same time, benefiting from the diversity across various markets. Using standard portfolio theory, we expected that by selectively diversifying our asset base, we could also reduce fluctuations in our cash flows, thereby delivering an elevated, extended and more stable growth trajectory over a very long period of time.
The results we have generated in our international markets confirm these principles. For example, on sites outside the U.S. that we've owned since the beginning of 2010, our U.S. dollar equivalent NOI yield as of the end of the second quarter was more than 30% as compared to around 18% on net vintage in the U.S. These results include both sites that we have acquired as part of our disciplined asset acquisition strategy and sites that we've constructed for our carrier customers.
Meanwhile, international sites added between 2010 and 2013 are already yielding around 12% today, with sites added over the last few years already yielding an average of about 10%. While the yields on our younger international assets are solid, we believe the real opportunities to make value on these newer assets lies ahead.
Our 2 decades of experience in the tower business have clearly illustrated that the longer we have assets in our portfolio, the more revenue and cash flow they generate. This is especially true outside the U.S., where most of our newly added sites have been single tenant at the time of acquisition or construction. Given that we have generated double-digit international organic tenant billings growth on average over the last 3 years and expect to continue to drive these types of solid growth rates going forward, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to drive significant NOI yield accretion on our international assets over time.
Consequently, we have positioned the company for continuing long-term success with our combined domestic U.S. and global asset base. MIT researchers, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have identified 3 key elements to building competitive advantage in the digital age: physical capital, intellectual capital and organizational capital. On all 3 of these dimensions, American Tower now has built a sustainable global competitive advantage in telecommunications real estate, which we believe would be difficult to replicate.
First is our physical capital. The 140,000-plus towers in small cell systems that we've constructed and acquired. Their high structural capacity, premier locations and existing and future cash flow generation potential. The depth, diversity and global reach of this physical capital are, in our view, unmatched. And we believe that replicating our portfolio while achieving similar economics in the future would be a very formidable task.
Second is the intellectual capital we have cultivated at American Tower since the mid-1990s. The systems and processes that we've developed, refined and optimized to be able to support tens of thousands of properties spanning 5 continents, and it positions the company for further asset growth in the future. I actually believe that ATC is world-class in the most critical operational skills in this business, formulating highly complex master lease agreements tailored to our customers' needs, coupled with the ability to manage literally hundreds of thousands of individual tenant and ground leases every month.
And third is the organizational capital that has been nurtured and developed at all levels in this company. I believe we have the most capable senior management team in the industry who have in turn built high-performance organizations in our key functions across all of our geographies. Our retention of highly skilled executives, managers and employees has been excellent, resulting in an experienced workforce today. Additionally, as a recognized global leader, American Tower's brand enables us to recruit outstanding talent to support the rapid growth of the business. We've also developed comprehensive training and development programs targeted to continually improve our capabilities and proprietary skills such as structural engineering and lease contracting.
So as a result of building our physical, intellectual and organizational capital methodically over the past 20 years, we've obtained a leadership position among fully independent tower companies in each of the leading free-market democracies on the 5 most populous continents in the world, while creating a cash flow engine that continues to gather momentum. With our unique and dynamic position in the telecommunications real estate business, we expect to provide an attractive combination of growth and yield to our investors for many, many years to come.
Thank you for joining our call this morning, and operator, please open it up now for questions."

But what we can do is provide you facts for the Big 4 U.S. national carriers in aggregate. And these are average remaining term and domestic churn, excluding our nonnational customers. Now we can sort of see the trend of the business as far as duration and falloff. So for 2016, our expected remaining term for the 4 nationals is 6.6 years, and the churn is only approximately 0.2%. So we feel very confident about the stability of our U.S. domestic sort of Big 4 asset base or revenue base right now. And the other piece of that is the escalator, which across the U.S. on average is still above 3%. So I'll turn it over to Tom."

And Amir, just I think kind of coupling to what Jim has just said, if you take a look at what our pipeline support, we've talked about this momentum kicking in into the second half.

And Amir, just I think kind of coupling to what Jim has just said, if you take a look at what our pipeline support, we've talked about this momentum kicking in into the second half. And we also, as a result, see about 47% of our total organic business generated in the first half with 53% in the second half. So I think that, that also kind of reflects my remarks and Jim's remarks that we can continually see this growing pipeline of colocation amendments. In the United States, I think you're well aware that over the last 3 quarters, it's been a large piece of amendment activity continually to filling in and meeting that capacity. And so as we've always talked about, we see this amendment in colo activity in the form of sine waves. And so we fully believe that all the carriers are generating their own sine wave in terms of new business, grooming, colos and amendments. And I think, as I mentioned, we see a more momentum coming even to the second half of the year, which we think will position us well then for going into 2017."

Just maybe this is for you, Jim or Tom. Just following up on the early question. The T-Mobile and AT&T, I think have pretty explicitly gone out there and tried to solicit alternatives for macrocell sites that have been compounding for maybe 10 or even 20 years, and there's conceivably a window for economic substitution for new tower builds. Could you talk about what you see is the vulnerability of AMT's domestic portfolio in terms of long-term leases that have compounded with terms of leases that are expiring with alternative sightings that might be nearby? It doesn't seem like it could be very big, but I'm wondering if you see it at all as a potential vulnerability at this stage? And then second, in India, obviously, Bharti Infratel has been talking about the potential for resetting lease -- pricing lower at the end of the term of some of their main shareholder leases. Obviously, with Viom, you're going to have a larger overlap with them. I was wondering if you could talk about kind of the outlook for market lease pricing in India going forward?"

What I would say about potential substitution anywhere for towers is that, just to remind you, you all know the functional inputs of the franchise value of the tower. And so first of all, any change of equipment from one tower to another one, assuming you could even build it nearby, is fairly costly for any operator. So that's something they've to put into their equation. Also, the longer the site has been up, the more equipment tends to be on it, et cetera, and the more embedded it is in the network. So there are some network difficulties and economic costs to doing a switch. But as you know, the other part of the franchise value is that most municipalities try to manage the number of structures in their jurisdiction, and would take that into account. And then thirdly, we continually try to reach mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers that can ameliorate the impact of specific high-priced sites as far as the contract. So we'll continue to help them as we can in that way as well. So I do think that having some metrics for you to track over the years will be a useful way to keep track of all this. And that's why I wanted to put out to you what are our average remaining term is for the Big 4 in aggregate and also what the churn rate for the nonnational sort of assets of the Big 4, excluding the nonnational the assets of the Big 4 are. And as I just said, it's 0.2%. So again, so far, with the industry conditions we expect to continue, it's very, very low as far as actual churn off. But we'll keep providing you those metrics as we go forward in time. Secondly, on the Indian market, it's a critical difference to be a truly independent provider of siting on any country versus a captive provider siting, in other words, you're a subsidiary or affiliate of the mobile operator itself. Those contracts, I don't want to speak to, but I can speak to our contracts with all mobile operators in India as being market-based and, therefore, arm's length, and certain provisions that may apply to captive contracts may or may not apply to ours. Just, I guess, I would set the foundation there, because we don't talk about specific contracts or discussions or negotiations in any of our markets. So that's again, I think, a fundamental way to look at it is how do independents deal with mobile operators and how do captives deal with mobile operators. And again, you can track our metrics over time in that regard."

I mean, the definitions are generally in the release and in the back of the slides that we have here. But I mean, the fundamental difference in the organic, we're really trying to -- as we talk about last quarter, really trying to give a true run rate, a recurring run rate of build revenue. And so the tenant billings, if you will, that recurring revenue that is constantly being invoiced to customers. Outside of that, which then gets you to the reported are things like pass-through and straight-line and all those other elements, which had a lot of volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And then on an organic basis, what we're really trying to do is again give you that recurring revenue that we have from colos, amendments plus escalators, less churn to give you a true view in terms of what the additional activity is happening on all of the sites that we have. So if you take a look at, for example, the U.S. in this particular quarter, if you'll exclude again the decommissioning revenue, which again was kind of again that volatile, now you're right in for the U.S., it's in the mid-5s, right in about that 5.5% and versus the organic number that we talked about now under the tenant billings methodology of 5.6%. So it's very, very similar in terms of what the rates were that we talked about last quarter and that we would see in Q2. Similarly, for international, if you looked at the core organic growth, we're talking about 13.7% on the tenant billings organic basis, which is the number we just referred to. On the international side, again, if you backed out the impact of oi [ph] we'd be right at 13.5%. So again, what we're trying to do is, we're trying to just reflect what that real run rate recurring billing stream would be. So very, very similar, just a couple of nuances in terms of the differences between the organic core growth and the tenant billings. The real differences being that decommissioning revenue in the U.S., which would be the kind of the major element to reconcile it to and the reserve that we took on the oi or on the Brazilian business in Brazil."

Regarding our small cell strategy overall, we've chosen to focus on indoor DAS systems and ultimately indoor small cell systems as where we think the best returns have and can be attained. We're also actively exploring innovative ways to achieve tower-like returns on other what we call macro supplement types of assets, and that could be outdoor small cells and other technologies that can better serve the high density venues. I think the classic tower, the macro tower is going to serve its purpose for the foreseeable future, because we are really in the business of in the macro tower world is providing mobile service and suburban largely and corridor -- transportation corridor and rural environments. And where a lot of the small cell demand is coming, as you hear from the carriers and others, is in the really high-density locations such as urban centers where towers don't have a role -- much of a role to play anyhow. So this could be a complementary business for us if we could figure out how to scale it, but importantly, how to scale it with tower-like returns. And that's what we're really aggressively exploring today, although I have to admit we haven't solved the problem quite yet. And I think already you're seeing that part of the issue with urban small cell deployments is the municipalities, again, have a big role and what gets built on their jurisdiction and how it gets built and if it's shared or single use. And so there are some municipal delays on some of the projects going on by all of the industry today. And we want to continue to work out all those issues as time goes on and figure out if we can get tower-like returns from these kinds of projects. So it's going to be a long-cycle approach. 5G, even a standard won't be settled probably 2019, 2020. And then, they'll start being deployed in some of these dense venues. In the meantime, 4G is the go-to technology for at least the next 4 or 5 years and then another 5 to 10 beyond if you migrate to 5G. So I think we have some time to figure this out, but it is a knotty problem and we hope we can figure out a way to get tower-like returns on a complementary asset some day."

But the technology deployment in India is for [indiscernible] right? I mean, we got a new entrant just on the cusp of launching national 4G network, which is going to -- in some way is leapfrog what's available today and also motivating the other market leaders to invest in 4G as well. So we see, as Tom said, sort of an up-cycle in technology investment in India at a scale that may have never been done before given the population in that country. And that will be over a few years, which has positioned us I think really well with the Viom acquisition as we kind of tuck it in now to ride that wave of technology investment. And there's some great companies involved here. These are significant multinationals like Vodafone as well as Bharti Airtel, as I mentioned, Reliance Industries. There's also Reliance Telecom. There is going to be some real competition from really moving quickly through 3G into 4G sort of technology territory. And as we all know, densification and siting equipment needs go up as you go into that higher technology stack. So we're very optimistic about the technology kind of road map for the country. As far as volume, what was interesting about the Viom merger with ATC India was that our major customers happened to be the partners at Indus. So again, Airtel, Vodafone, Idea are very large customers of ATC, proportionately not so much actually of Viom where, of course, Tata was the core customer there. So we got very complementary opportunity when we put these 2 assets together to drive volume in both directions, which I think is really going to be great for leasing for our market, again over the next number of years it will play out. And then finally, pricing, I think it's miscasting that our pricing is lower than the cap as our pricing we tend to drive as high as we can without being tethered to the parent, and that's been I think a fairly successful endeavor. But we do have to stay in the context of the overall market and certainly don't overprice. But I would say that we're probably on the upper end of pricing given our independence and the quality of our assets and finally, our ability to do construction jobs quickly and in difficult places."

And you can see that even on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I think the number is around $20 million. It was almost identical to what it was same quarter of last year. So that number continues to be fairly consistent on an annual basis. There's not a lot of volatility, not a lot of growth, not a lot of decline in it. As we continue to invest in those types of systems, where we're actually getting capital contributions. So I look at it from 2 perspectives.

And then the recognition of that particular revenue is down over the remaining balance of the lease term."

Good morning, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter earnings.
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the second quarter 2016 as well as our full year outlook for the full year of 2016. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on our international business and strategy. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations for future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance; technology and industry trends; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. I'd like to note that we have updated the name of our run rate revenue metric to tenant billing. As we highlighted for you last quarter when we introduced this metric, it reflects the current tenant billings, which are generated by our global portfolio of communications real estate.
In addition, in response to recently issued disclosure guidance by the SEC, after today, we will no longer reference our core growth metrics.
So with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.43 billion. Total revenues grew approximately 23% to over $1.44 billion, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 24% to $161 million or $0.37 per diluted common share.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was over 18% and included an income tax reserve related to our Viom transaction. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate will be in the low double digits. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter grew 14% to approximately $869 million and consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by over 10% to approximately $592 million or $1.38 per diluted share.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
24766,370254868,1016503,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also declared a common stock divid",2275,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also declared a common stock dividend of $0.53 a share, which was up over 20% from the prior year period. And given the close of our Viom transaction in late April, our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate more than 42,000 towers we added to our portfolio with that acquisition.
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we generated strong performance with total reported property revenue growth of about 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 23%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent demand levels throughout our global footprint.
Our total property revenue growth this quarter included a negative 60 basis point impact from a $7 million revenue reserve related to receivables associated with a tenant in Brazil, which were outstanding at the time of their judicial reorganization filing. Based on our prior experiences with carrier bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings, we expect to pursue the full amount owed to us. Additionally, I would note that this tenant has resumed payments to us for amounts owed subsequent to their judicial reorganization filing date.
Our U.S. property segment generated total reported revenue growth of about 3%, including a negative 1.4% impact from straight-line revenue account recognition. We did not book any decommissioning revenue this quarter as compared to about $8 million recorded in Q2 of last year and $31 million or so booked in Q1. This negatively impacted our U.S. property revenue growth by an additional 1.1%.
U.S. organic tenant billings growth for the quarter was 5.6%, which again reflects organic build recurring revenue and was right in line with our expectations. Demand trends in the U.S. remain very steady with carriers actively spending to augment their 4G networks. Our international markets generated organic tenant billings growth of 13.7% or 800 basis points higher than that of the U.S. Escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributed about 7% to that growth, while organic new business commencements were even larger component of the growth at about 7.6%. These were partially offset by some churn of just over 1%.
There was broad strength across our international property segments with all 3 posting double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates, including 12% in Latin America, 20% in EMEA and over 10% in Asia. Our multinational tenant base in these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to advance headsets -- handsets at lower per unit cost and begin to use exponentially more data on those handsets. The benefits of the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model continues to be evidenced by the strong growth rates we are generating in our international markets.
Finally, on a total property basis, the day one revenue associated with the nearly 57,000 sites we have added since the second quarter of last year, including the Viom, Airtel Nigeria and TIM Brazil portfolios and roughly 3,400 new builds contributed another 15% to our total tenant billings growth in Q2, bringing the total growth to the nearly 23%. Our newbuild program remains active, and we constructed nearly 400 towers this quarter with an average day one NOI yield of over 10%.
Moving on to Slide 7. The combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Gross margin in the quarter remained strong at over 68% despite a negative impact of over 10% from pass-through and a negative impact of 4.6% due to the addition of new sites, which have lower initial tenancies and margins. This was supported by strong conversion of revenue to gross margin on legacy sites during the quarter, while our reported conversion of revenue to gross margin was around 49% as a result of the previously mentioned negative impacts of pass-through revenue and lower-tenancy new sites, which on a combined basis negatively impacted the reported conversion ratio by about 50%. Our ability to convert revenue to gross margin on our pre-existing sites remain strong and in line with historical norms of well over 90%.
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60% for the quarter, which includes a negative impact from pass-through of about 9%. This also includes about 4.3% of margin dilution associated with new sites brought into the portfolio since the start of the second quarter of last year, including Viom. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue was about 8.1% in the quarter and is expected to be right around 8% for the full year.
Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to about $869 million as a result of our top line growth, coupled with the diligent operational expense management. Our solid adjusted EBITDA performance drove growth in consolidated AFFO as it's slightly lower-than-expected capital improvement and capital expenditures. This led to growth in consolidated AFFO of over 10% and growth in consolidated AFFO per share of nearly 10%. The global operational efficiency initiatives that we put into place continue to result in strong profitability for the business.
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with financial policies designed to support this objective by managing risk across the capital structure in support of our investment-grade rating. In the second quarter, we pursued several financing initiatives directly supporting these policies. First, we raised $1 billion in 10-year senior unsecured notes at a historically low coupon rate for ATC of 3.375%. This opportunistic transaction increased our liquidity and turned out a significant portion of our floating rate debt.
Next, we assume nearly $800 million of rupee-denominated debt in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in Viom. We immediately commenced a multiyear process to refinance the existing loans locally at more attractive rates than the initial 11% average coupon. They have already decreased the average cost to about 10.3%. These actions highlight our excellent access to diversified funding sources, including the investment-grade bond market as well as an ability to maintain a substantial base of liquidity to support our solid balance sheet. As a result, as of the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 5.3x net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5x net debt or below. And longer term, our target leverage range remains between 3 and 5x.
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid performance in the first half of the year, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and underlying trends that are consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full year guidance for 2016. At the midpoint of our outlook, we're increasing our expectations for property revenue by $10 million or about 0.2%, resulting in projected reported growth of 21% or so. The increase is being driven by a $14 million increase in straight-line revenue and $7 million in favorability in organic tenant billing revenue across our property segment. This favorability is being partially offset by about $7 million from the reserve book this quarter in Brazil as well as about $4 million associated with lower expected pass-through revenue.
The positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations versus our prior outlook for revenue is just about $1 million, given that the devaluation of the naira is offsetting the strengthening of the majority of our other currencies. Also, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from any of our pending transactions that have yet to close.
Within our total revenue projections, we expect in the U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.5% to 6% for the year. This reflects a steady demand environment similar to what we have seen year-to-date and anticipated acceleration in our growth rate in the second half of the year as a result of a more even spread of new business commencements compared to the prior year period.
Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of nearly 14% supported by especially strong trends in markets like Mexico, Nigeria and Uganda, where new business commencement activity is incredibly strong. At consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Newly-acquired and build sites are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year or just over 14%. This growth has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now on a consolidated basis stand at nearly $32 billion, with an average remaining lease term of about 5.6 years.
We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. This reflects cash SG&A as a percent of total revenue of right around 8%. Our increased adjusted EBITDA outlook is driven by an $8 million benefit associated with increased net straight-line, $17 million in FX favorability and about $6 million in outperformance in the underlying property business relative to our previous expectations. This is being partially offset by $7 million receivable reserve booked in Q2 and about $9 million in lower expected contribution from our services segment versus our prior outlook, where the pipeline of project-based activity has slowed. Given that substantially all of our Nigerian OpEx and SG&A expenses are denominated in local currency and that over half of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, the impact of the Nigerian Naira devaluation I referenced earlier to EBITDA is minimal.
Finally, we're raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $15 million at the midpoint or about 0.6%. This is being driven primarily by the $7 million increase in cash EBITDA, just discussed, plus roughly $13 million due to lower net cash interest expense expectations. This increase of $20 million is being partially offset by about $5 million resulting from higher expectations for corporate capital expenditures, primarily associated with IT spending to support our global operations. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.69 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of about 12%.
Before we move on, I'd also like to note that factoring in the July month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of about $33 million for property revenue, $18 million for adjusted EBITDA and $14 million for consolidated AFFO or about $0.03 per share relative to the midpoints of our current outlook.
Turning to Slide 11. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we've declared nearly $500 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends, spent approximately $1.2 billion on accretive acquisitions and deployed nearly $330 million in CapEx so far this year, which includes nearly $76 million spent on ground lease purchases. In fact, since 2011, we've deployed over $500 million for ground lease purchases in the U.S., while increasing the percentage of towers on land we owned or control for over 20 years from about 55% in 2011 to nearly 67% today and extending the average remaining term on our lease land from just under 22 years to nearly 25 years. This activity further secures our long-term recurring cash flows while generating margin improvement and enhancing the operating leverage of our business through land rent expense reduction. We expect to continue deploying capital for land purchases over the long term and are targeting to have 80% of our towers in the U.S. on land that is either owned or leased for more than 20 years by 2020.
We believe that our disciplined capital allocation strategy will enable us to deliver the combination of growth in consolidated AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions and drive compelling total returns for many years to come. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our dividend subject to board approval of at least 20%.
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we've enhanced our strategic positioning so far in 2016 by continuing to employ a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy. First, we further diversified our international presence by acquiring a controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. We believe mobile networks there poised for significant 4G investments in urban metros and for continuing deployment of coverage and initial data services in the suburban and rural areas where over 2/3 of Indians live.
Second, we've continued to drive operational excellence through our business while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios in several key markets. And third, we've remained focused on strengthening our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing and selected debt repayments. And fourth, we've simultaneously maintained strong growth in our common stock dividend. As a result, we're well positioned to finish this year strong, driving compelling growth in revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO while returning significant cash to our shareholders through our common stock dividend. This is all made possible by our unmatched global scale, experienced regional leadership teams and disciplined capital allocation strategy, which we expect to remain consistent for the rest of this year and well into the future.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated a",1040,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA and Latin America segments all generated another strong quarter of operating results in Q2, once again serving as a turbocharger for our market-leading domestic business.
Beginning with American Tower's first international investment in Mexico in 1999, we methodically expanded our geographic scope and scale based on the set of fundamental tenants. First, we recognized that the power of the tower business model that has first been developed in the United States should equally apply in additional countries that presented the right operating conditions. It is our experience that due to a number of common factors, the fundamental drivers of tower demand are consistent across our selected geographies.
First, consumers everywhere have a huge appetite for mobile technology and service. And moreover, the underlying physics of radio wave propagation, usable spectrum bands and the 2G, 3G and 4G technology standards all apply globally. Plus, the network equipment on the OEMs, the handset manufacturers such as Apple and the chipset developers like QUALCOMM sell their products all over the world.
Second, we understood from our U.S. experience that by buying towers from mobile operators, we could transform single-use, nonperforming cost-center assets into high-performing, multiuse commercial real estate. Consequently, sale leaseback transactions for these assets provide an additional source of capital to mobile operators, so they could more rapidly deploy their active networks and grow their core business. Again, since these common sense economics apply across multiple countries, we've been able to pursue the same strategy successfully to date in Latin America, Africa, Germany and India.
And third, we recognized that we could dramatically increase our growth opportunities while at the same time, benefiting from the diversity across various markets. Using standard portfolio theory, we expected that by selectively diversifying our asset base, we could also reduce fluctuations in our cash flows, thereby delivering an elevated, extended and more stable growth trajectory over a very long period of time.
The results we have generated in our international markets confirm these principles. For example, on sites outside the U.S. that we've owned since the beginning of 2010, our U.S. dollar equivalent NOI yield as of the end of the second quarter was more than 30% as compared to around 18% on net vintage in the U.S. These results include both sites that we have acquired as part of our disciplined asset acquisition strategy and sites that we've constructed for our carrier customers.
Meanwhile, international sites added between 2010 and 2013 are already yielding around 12% today, with sites added over the last few years already yielding an average of about 10%. While the yields on our younger international assets are solid, we believe the real opportunities to make value on these newer assets lies ahead.
Our 2 decades of experience in the tower business have clearly illustrated that the longer we have assets in our portfolio, the more revenue and cash flow they generate. This is especially true outside the U.S., where most of our newly added sites have been single tenant at the time of acquisition or construction. Given that we have generated double-digit international organic tenant billings growth on average over the last 3 years and expect to continue to drive these types of solid growth rates going forward, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to drive significant NOI yield accretion on our international assets over time.
Consequently, we have positioned the company for continuing long-term success with our combined domestic U.S. and global asset base. MIT researchers, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have identified 3 key elements to building competitive advantage in the digital age: physical capital, intellectual capital and organizational capital. On all 3 of these dimensions, American Tower now has built a sustainable global competitive advantage in telecommunications real estate, which we believe would be difficult to replicate.
First is our physical capital. The 140,000-plus towers in small cell systems that we've constructed and acquired. Their high structural capacity, premier locations and existing and future cash flow generation potential. The depth, diversity and global reach of this physical capital are, in our view, unmatched. And we believe that replicating our portfolio while achieving similar economics in the future would be a very formidable task.
Second is the intellectual capital we have cultivated at American Tower since the mid-1990s. The systems and processes that we've developed, refined and optimized to be able to support tens of thousands of properties spanning 5 continents, and it positions the company for further asset growth in the future. I actually believe that ATC is world-class in the most critical operational skills in this business, formulating highly complex master lease agreements tailored to our customers' needs, coupled with the ability to manage literally hundreds of thousands of individual tenant and ground leases every month.
And third is the organizational capital that has been nurtured and developed at all levels in this company. I believe we have the most capable senior management team in the industry who have in turn built high-performance organizations in our key functions across all of our geographies. Our retention of highly skilled executives, managers and employees has been excellent, resulting in an experienced workforce today. Additionally, as a recognized global leader, American Tower's brand enables us to recruit outstanding talent to support the rapid growth of the business. We've also developed comprehensive training and development programs targeted to continually improve our capabilities and proprietary skills such as structural engineering and lease contracting.
So as a result of building our physical, intellectual and organizational capital methodically over the past 20 years, we've obtained a leadership position among fully independent tower companies in each of the leading free-market democracies on the 5 most populous continents in the world, while creating a cash flow engine that continues to gather momentum. With our unique and dynamic position in the telecommunications real estate business, we expect to provide an attractive combination of growth and yield to our investors for many, many years to come.
Thank you for joining our call this morning, and operator, please open it up now for questions."

As you mentioned, Tom, you're guidance factors in what I believe you characterized and anticipated acceleration of new business. While I realize giving carrier-specific detail isn't where you may want to go, perhaps you can give us color on one initiatives you're seeing? And how you think the trajectory of the business should turn over the next 12 months? And then I guess within that, during the quarter, I feel like there's been a lot of questions or conversations about how to think about future escalator rates in the U.S. with perhaps some of the carriers expressing some consternation about how the compounding growth outlook of that cost structure would be for them? Maybe you can provide us with some insight on what you're hearing from your conversations with carriers? And whether you believe there's either a risk or perhaps middle ground going forward?"

Why don't I take the second part of your question, and Tom can go to the more quantitative side after that. As you know and as you said, we do not comment on specific customer negotiations, discussions or their plans. But what we can do is provide you facts for the Big 4 U.S. national carriers in aggregate. And these are average remaining term and domestic churn, excluding our nonnational customers. Now we can sort of see the trend of the business as far as duration and falloff. So for 2016, our expected remaining term for the 4 nationals is 6.6 years, and the churn is only approximately 0.2%. So we feel very confident about the stability of our U.S. domestic sort of Big 4 asset base or revenue base right now. And the other piece of that is the escalator, which across the U.S. on average is still above 3%. So I'll turn it over to Tom."

So I think that, that also kind of reflects my remarks and Jim's remarks that we can continually see this growing pipeline of colocation amendments. In the United States, I think you're well aware that over the last 3 quarters, it's been a large piece of amendment activity continually to filling in and meeting that capacity. And so as we've always talked about, we see this amendment in colo activity in the form of sine waves. And so we fully believe that all the carriers are generating their own sine wave in terms of new business, grooming, colos and amendments. And I think, as I mentioned, we see a more momentum coming even to the second half of the year, which we think will position us well then for going into 2017."

Just maybe this is for you, Jim or Tom. Just following up on the early question. The T-Mobile and AT&T, I think have pretty explicitly gone out there and tried to solicit alternatives for macrocell sites that have been compounding for maybe 10 or even 20 years, and there's conceivably a window for economic substitution for new tower builds. Could you talk about what you see is the vulnerability of AMT's domestic portfolio in terms of long-term leases that have compounded with terms of leases that are expiring with alternative sightings that might be nearby? It doesn't seem like it could be very big, but I'm wondering if you see it at all as a potential vulnerability at this stage? And then second, in India, obviously, Bharti Infratel has been talking about the potential for resetting lease -- pricing lower at the end of the term of some of their main shareholder leases. Obviously, with Viom, you're going to have a larger overlap with them. I was wondering if you could talk about kind of the outlook for market lease pricing in India going forward?"

What I would say about potential substitution anywhere for towers is that, just to remind you, you all know the functional inputs of the franchise value of the tower. And so first of all, any change of equipment from one tower to another one, assuming you could even build it nearby, is fairly costly for any operator. So that's something they've to put into their equation. Also, the longer the site has been up, the more equipment tends to be on it, et cetera, and the more embedded it is in the network. So there are some network difficulties and economic costs to doing a switch. But as you know, the other part of the franchise value is that most municipalities try to manage the number of structures in their jurisdiction, and would take that into account. And then thirdly, we continually try to reach mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers that can ameliorate the impact of specific high-priced sites as far as the contract. So we'll continue to help them as we can in that way as well. So I do think that having some metrics for you to track over the years will be a useful way to keep track of all this. And that's why I wanted to put out to you what are our average remaining term is for the Big 4 in aggregate and also what the churn rate for the nonnational sort of assets of the Big 4, excluding the nonnational the assets of the Big 4 are. And as I just said, it's 0.2%. So again, so far, with the industry conditions we expect to continue, it's very, very low as far as actual churn off. But we'll keep providing you those metrics as we go forward in time. Secondly, on the Indian market, it's a critical difference to be a truly independent provider of siting on any country versus a captive provider siting, in other words, you're a subsidiary or affiliate of the mobile operator itself. Those contracts, I don't want to speak to, but I can speak to our contracts with all mobile operators in India as being market-based and, therefore, arm's length, and certain provisions that may apply to captive contracts may or may not apply to ours. Just, I guess, I would set the foundation there, because we don't talk about specific contracts or discussions or negotiations in any of our markets. So that's again, I think, a fundamental way to look at it is how do independents deal with mobile operators and how do captives deal with mobile operators. And again, you can track our metrics over time in that regard."

I mean, the definitions are generally in the release and in the back of the slides that we have here. But I mean, the fundamental difference in the organic, we're really trying to -- as we talk about last quarter, really trying to give a true run rate, a recurring run rate of build revenue. And so the tenant billings, if you will, that recurring revenue that is constantly being invoiced to customers. Outside of that, which then gets you to the reported are things like pass-through and straight-line and all those other elements, which had a lot of volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And then on an organic basis, what we're really trying to do is again give you that recurring revenue that we have from colos, amendments plus escalators, less churn to give you a true view in terms of what the additional activity is happening on all of the sites that we have. So if you take a look at, for example, the U.S. in this particular quarter, if you'll exclude again the decommissioning revenue, which again was kind of again that volatile, now you're right in for the U.S., it's in the mid-5s, right in about that 5.5% and versus the organic number that we talked about now under the tenant billings methodology of 5.6%. So it's very, very similar in terms of what the rates were that we talked about last quarter and that we would see in Q2. Similarly, for international, if you looked at the core organic growth, we're talking about 13.7% on the tenant billings organic basis, which is the number we just referred to. On the international side, again, if you backed out the impact of oi [ph] we'd be right at 13.5%. So again, what we're trying to do is, we're trying to just reflect what that real run rate recurring billing stream would be. So very, very similar, just a couple of nuances in terms of the differences between the organic core growth and the tenant billings. The real differences being that decommissioning revenue in the U.S., which would be the kind of the major element to reconcile it to and the reserve that we took on the oi or on the Brazilian business in Brazil."

Regarding our small cell strategy overall, we've chosen to focus on indoor DAS systems and ultimately indoor small cell systems as where we think the best returns have and can be attained. We're also actively exploring innovative ways to achieve tower-like returns on other what we call macro supplement types of assets, and that could be outdoor small cells and other technologies that can better serve the high density venues. I think the classic tower, the macro tower is going to serve its purpose for the foreseeable future, because we are really in the business of in the macro tower world is providing mobile service and suburban largely and corridor -- transportation corridor and rural environments. And where a lot of the small cell demand is coming, as you hear from the carriers and others, is in the really high-density locations such as urban centers where towers don't have a role -- much of a role to play anyhow. So this could be a complementary business for us if we could figure out how to scale it, but importantly, how to scale it with tower-like returns. And that's what we're really aggressively exploring today, although I have to admit we haven't solved the problem quite yet. And I think already you're seeing that part of the issue with urban small cell deployments is the municipalities, again, have a big role and what gets built on their jurisdiction and how it gets built and if it's shared or single use. And so there are some municipal delays on some of the projects going on by all of the industry today. And we want to continue to work out all those issues as time goes on and figure out if we can get tower-like returns from these kinds of projects. So it's going to be a long-cycle approach. 5G, even a standard won't be settled probably 2019, 2020. And then, they'll start being deployed in some of these dense venues. In the meantime, 4G is the go-to technology for at least the next 4 or 5 years and then another 5 to 10 beyond if you migrate to 5G. So I think we have some time to figure this out, but it is a knotty problem and we hope we can figure out a way to get tower-like returns on a complementary asset someday."

There is going to be some real competition from really moving quickly through 3G into 4G sort of technology territory. And as we all know, densification and siting equipment needs go up as you go into that higher technology stack. So we're very optimistic about the technology kind of road map for the country. As far as volume, what was interesting about the Viom merger with ATC India was that our major customers happened to be the partners at Indus. So again, Airtel, Vodafone, Idea are very large customers of ATC, proportionately not so much actually of Viom where, of course, Tata was the core customer there. So we got very complementary opportunity when we put these 2 assets together to drive volume in both directions, which I think is really going to be great for leasing for our market, again over the next number of years it will play out. And then finally, pricing, I think it's miscasting that our pricing is lower than the cap as our pricing we tend to drive as high as we can without being tethered to the parent, and that's been I think a fairly successful endeavor. But we do have to stay in the context of the overall market and certainly don't overprice. But I would say that we're probably on the upper end of pricing given our independence and the quality of our assets and finally, our ability to do construction jobs quickly and in difficult places."

So that number continues to be fairly consistent on an annual basis. There's not a lot of volatility, not a lot of growth, not a lot of decline in it. As we continue to invest in those types of systems, where we're actually getting capital contributions. So I look at it from 2 perspectives.

Good morning, everyone. We had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and margin performance across our global asset base, in fact achieving record levels of new business commencements in the quarter. Once again, we",2316,"Okay. Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. We had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and margin performance across our global asset base, in fact achieving record levels of new business commencements in the quarter. 
Once again, we achieved double-digit growth rates across all of our key metrics. During the period, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.55 per share, which, for 2016, we are targeting to grow over 20% from the prior year. 
Simultaneously, we continued to diligently integrate the Viom assets while focusing on driving organic growth and scaling our business worldwide. We also achieved our year-end leverage target about 3 months ahead of schedule. 
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. Total reported property revenue growth was nearly 24%. This included totaled 10 billings growth of over 21%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent wireless customer demand for our real estate throughout our global footprint. As I mentioned, organic commenced new business in the quarter was at record levels, about 23% higher than the Q3 of last year, split almost evenly between our U.S. and international businesses. Our U.S. Property segment revenue growth was about 3.6% factoring in a negative 1.7% impact from straight line revenue recognition. In addition, we've booked about $0.5 million in decommissioning revenue this quarter, as compared to about $4 million recorded in Q3 of last year, resulting in an additional 50 basis point negative impact to the growth rate. For the quarter, U.S. organic tenant billings growth was right in line with our expectations at 5.7%, reflecting a slight acceleration from Q2. Volume growth from co-locations and amendments contributed about 4.4%, while pricing escalators contributed 2.8% and other run rate items contributed about 30 basis points. This was partially offset by churn of about 1.8%, of which the vast majority was associated with smaller, non-big 4 tenants. And as we disclosed last quarter, operational churn from the big 4 wireless carriers, what we call core networks in the U.S., which is defined as excluding activity on the former network, has remained at about 30 basis points. Demand trends in the U.S. remained steady with carriers actively spending to augment the coverage and capacity of their 4G networks. 
Our international organic tenant billings growth was 13%, about 725 basis points higher than that of the U.S. While pricing escalators, driven by local CPI indices contributed about 7% of that growth. Volumes from co-locations and amendments were an even larger component at about 7.3%. Other run rate items contributed an additional 40 basis points. These all were partially offset by churn of about 1.6%. There was broad strength across our international property segment, with all 3 achieving double-digit organic organic tenant billings growth rates for the sixth quarter in a row. Organic tenant billings growth was almost 14% in Latin America, 12% in EMEA and over 11% in Asia. Our large multinational tenants in all these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to affordable, advanced headsets and begin to use significantly more data on those handsets. And these network investments appeared to be catalyzing incremental usage as the mobile experience gets better and better. For example, a carrier deploying a new greenfield 4G wireless broadband network in India has reported that its customers on average are already using well over 1 gig of data per day on that network. Along with trends like this, we expect the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model to continue to drive strong growth rates for our international portfolio. Further, day 1 revenue associated with the nearly 46,000 sites we've added since the third quarter of last year, which includes the Viom portfolio and about 2,100 new builds, contributed another 13% to our global tenant billings growth in Q3. Our new build program remains active, and we constructed over 350 towers globally this quarter. While this level of build activity was a bit lower than historical levels, we would expect this trend to reverse and build activity to pick up again in Q4. Our newly build sites average an NOI yield of over 10% this quarter on a consolidated basis. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Gross margin in the quarter was nearly 68%, which was negatively impacted by past-due revenue and the addition of nearly 46,000 new lower initial margin sites. In the quarter, adjusting for the impact of past due, we converted more than 90% of revenue to gross margin on sites that we've owned for more than a year. This strong conversion performance generated rising NOI yields across our portfolio. The average NOI yield on international sites built to require up to including 2009, for example, rose to 32% while the NOI yield on-site data between 2010 and 2013 improved to 13%. And even on sites added in 2014 and later, including Viom, NOI yields are rising, improving sequentially to about 10%.  We think we have a tremendous opportunity to increase these NOI yields over time, particularly on our younger assets. 
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60.4% for the quarter, which was similarly impacted by pass-through in new sites. 
Cash, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, declined 7.4% in the quarter and is expected to be under 8% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed in Slide 8. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew over 17% to approximately $915 million, and consolidated AFFO grew by nearly 15%, driven by combination of a solid adjusted EBITDA growth and expansion and seasonally lower-than-expected capital improvement CapEx. We do expect higher levels of capital improvement CapEx in fourth quarter due to the other spend this quarter. Consolidated AFFO per share growth in the quarter was almost 14%, resulting in year-to-date AFFO per share growth of over 12%. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. In late September, for example, we raised a total of $1 billion in unsecured senior notes with a weighted average maturity of over 7 years and historically low [indiscernible] rates for ADC. This transaction increased our average debt tenor to 5.3 years, increased our proportion of fixed-rate debt, which is now 76% overall, and even higher for U.S. funded debt at 80%. This transaction also allowed us to continue our long-held strategy of paying down our outstanding bank debt, which is primarily being used to support past acquisitions. This allows us to maximize our financial flexibility. 
In addition, as in the end of the third quarter, we achieved our goal of reducing our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA to 5x 3 months ahead of schedule. Longer term, our target leverage remains between 3 and 5x. In addition, we continue to be well protected from the impacts of potentially rising interest rates. In fact, the 25 basis point increase in LIBOR, [indiscernible] just to $9 million [ph] in impact to AFFO on an annualized basis. 
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid year-to-date performance, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and Q4 growth expectations that are broadly consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our outlook for property revenue by $50 million or about 0.9%, resulting in projected full year growth of almost 22% or just over $1 billion. The increase is being driven by about a $25 million increase in past-due revenue and a $5 million increase in straight line revenue on an FX-neutral basis with remaining upside being driven by favorability from foreign exchange rate trends. Principally, that was generated in Q3. As in the past, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from pending transactions. 
Within our total revenue projections, we continue to expect U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.8% for the year, which reflects a steady demand environment. Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of over 13%, supported by strong trends in markets like Mexico and Ghana. We do expect slightly lower full year tenant billings growth in India, as compared to prior outlook, primarily due to carriers temporarily pausing some of their activities as they are waiting for the recent spectrum auctions to conclude. However, we anticipate that organic tenant billings growth in Asia would increase to the mid-teens level during Q4. 
At a consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Day 1 revenue from sites added in the last year is expected to contribute to the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year just about 15%. The growth outlined above has resulted in a continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now stands at around $32.5 billion, with an average remaining lease term of 5.7 years on a consolidated basis and about 6.4 years for our big 4 wireless customers in the U.S. 
We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, resulting in expected full year growth of about 16% or roughly $500 million. The $25 million increase is being driven by a slight increase in net straight line, $15 million in and FX favorability and roughly $10 million in expense management outperformance relative to our previous expectations for the property segment. This is being partially offset by a slightly lower expected contribution from our services segment versus our prior outlook as a result of lower activity levels. 
Finally, we are raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $30 million or by over 1% at the midpoint, resulting in expected full year growth of about 15% or about $320 million. This $30 million increase is being driven primarily by about a $20 million increase in cash EBITDA and roughly $10 million in lower net interest expense. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.75 in the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of over 13%. 
Before I move on, I'd also note that factoring in our October month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of over $20 million for property revenue, $10 million for adjusted EBITDA and about $5 million of consolidate AFFO relative to the midpoints of our revised outlook. 
Turning to Slide 11. So far in 2016, we've demonstrated an ability to simultaneously deleverage the balance sheet, deploy meaningful capital to both our CapEx and acquisition programs and continue to fund a common stock dividend, which is expected to grow over 20% versus the prior year. Much of this is attributable to the significant internal cash flow generation capacity of our business, which is illustrated on this slide. As you can see, on a full year basis, our projected cash from operations of around $2.5 billion allows us to fully fund over $900 million in expected common stock dividends and more than $700 million in anticipated total capital expenditures, while at the same time leaving us around $1 billion of additional discretionary investment capacity. As a result, we've been able to close significant transactions like Viom as well as other smaller deals for a total of about $2.1 billion year-to-date and still reach our leverage target of 5x a full quarter earlier. This leaves us with around $300 million in incremental capacity for the fourth quarter. This estimate doesn't include any of the anticipated proceeds from our European JV transaction which we announced earlier today. Going forward, we would expect the internal cash flow generation capacity of our business to expand further as we continue to drive the high-margin conversion ratios on our organic revenue growth throughout our global footprint. 
In combination with being able to lever our incremental adjusted EBITDA growth, we would expect to have significant recurring investment capacity going forward. 
In addition, as we announced this morning, we've signed an agreement to form a strategic joint venture in Europe with PGGM. The formation of this joint venture, in addition to aligning us with a high-quality partner, will free up even more cash for us to deploy throughout our higher-growth markets. In addition, the JV has been established to explore and evaluate potentially invest in new market opportunities in Europe. By closing, we will contribute our [indiscernible] assets in ATC Europe and PGGM will acquire a 49% interest in this entity. American Tower will retain operational control and day-to-day oversight of the business. 
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year as our global business continues to generate solid growth across all of our key metrics. Our outlook now reflects consolidated AFFO per share growth of 13%, up from around 10% in our initial guidance provided in February. And we continue to expect dividend growth of over 20%. 
Looking forward, we believe we are poised to continue generating meaningful returns for investors for several key reasons: First, we are able to tap into the secular growth trends in mobile on a global scale, which we believe, when combined with our operational execution, will be the strong recurring growth across our existing asset base. Second, given our proven approach to capital allocation, a solid balance sheet with capital structure within our targeted range and healthy free cash flow generation, we will have significant capacity to either invest in our business or return directly back to stockholders. And lastly, we believe we will continue to be able to generate strong growth in our common stock dividend. Putting this all together, we believe that we have built a dynamic, sustainable long-term model for generating meaningful growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology.

As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology. While the emphasis this morning is on the U.S., we expect similar trends to follow in our underserved markets. 
Mobile data usage continues to escalate rapidly. According to Cisco, the average U.S. smartphone now consumes more than 1.4 gigabits of data per month or a 1,700% increase from just 5 years ago. Video continues to power significant portion of that usage with advanced devices like the iPhone 7 and services to like YouTube and Netflix. Consequently, total mobile data usage in the U.S. is now at more than 500 terabytes per month. Despite this, 4G penetration is estimated at only 60% to 65% in the U.S. today, indicating that there is still significant growth to come simply from the device upgrade cycle as subscribers acquire more advanced handsets. 
So to keep pace with the strain these trends create on mobile network, the big 4 U.S. wireless carriers have consistently spent about $30 billion per year in CapEx since 2010, or roughly 15% of their total revenue in aggregate. And while the total spend has remained consistent, the per-gigabit cost for wireless carriers has dropped by more than 99% since 2005. This dramatic drop in expenses per gigabit has been supported through a combination of new spectrum, technology advancements and radio access network investments in these sites. We continue to believe that this level of capital intensity, which has been maintained over the last 10 years and has supported strong organic tenant billings growth for our business, is sustainable over the long term. 
In addition, over the past 5 years, the U.S. government has auctioned or otherwise made available close to 300 megahertz of new spectrum. We expect incremental spectrum assets, like AWS-3 and the WCS bands as well as the 700 megahertz spectrum that's been committed for the forthcoming public safety build-out, to be deployed over the next several years. 
As in the past, to fully capitalize on the availability of this spectrum, we anticipate that new antennas and radios will be placed on our towers, which should continue to help support healthy levels of growth for us in the U.S. 
We also expect the vast majority of these deployments in the near to medium term will take place on 4G macro tower networks, particularly given that the 5G standard isn't expected to be formalized until 2019. 
Meanwhile, technological advancements such as software-defined networks, self-optimizing networks and cloud REM, among others, continue to focus primarily on the mobile core network. These advancements have enabled mobile carriers to achieve significant savings on their core network operations, bringing up more resources for the radio access networks support. At the same time, macro towers remain the most cost- and technologically-efficient solution for radio signal propagation in the vast majority of areas across our country. 
Looking forward, we expect that improved devices, greater 4G penetration, more and better applications and consumers' behavior will continue to drive mobile data usage at a 30% to 40% annual growth rate. In addition, the expanding role of the Internet of things, or IOT, will add further demands on mobile networks. In the near to midterm, this network burn will be shouldered by 4G technology. We expect that any near-term 5G deployments will be extremely short-ranged, essentially used for fixed wireless solution. And furthermore, we expect that many early deployments of 5G will actually be indoors, where ATC is already a leading provider of indoor small cell networks today. Eventually, after the year 2020, we do think 5G technology will be widely applied for mobile applications, beginning first in dense urban areas, then spreading to suburban and rural areas predominately served by macro towers. This time line also coincides with the clearing process of the 600 megahertz spectrum that's currently being auctioned. To the extent that this spectrum is in fact used for a broad 5G coverage build-out, we believe it could be a significant benefit for our tower business, given the large size and substantial way the antennas required for optimal use of low band spectrum like 600 megahertz. To the extent you'd like some additional information on the evolution of 4G and the potential impacts of 5G on our business, I'd encourage all of you to reference the presentation we have posted on the company and industry resources section of the American Tower Investor Relations website. 
So to summarize, we believe that the U.S. is still probably in the fifth or sixth inning of 4G deployments and that further 4G equipment installations will still be largely on macro towers. In 5G, while initially a primarily fixed wireless broadband technology to compete with the likes of cable, is likely to eventually be deployed for mobile services across our macro tower infrastructure that mainly serves suburban and rural areas where most Americans live and commute. As a result, we expect to generate solid growth in the U.S. market for years to come. 
So with that, operator, please open the call up for questions."

What this joint ventures sets us up to do is should we -- and our partners at PGGM believe that we have a good opportunity, we'll be able to finance it much more efficiently. We could, in theory, do a large-scale move in Europe with our partner, with much less strain on our own balance sheet potentially.

And the other piece of this, as I said, it's got higher-band spectrum and much more video content being run across the network, which indicates that you're going to have to have cell sites closer together. So the high-band spectrum because when you do carrier aggregation, you're also going to have to solve for the lowest common denominator spectrum, meaning the shortest transmission range. And as you get into 1.9, 2.1, 2.5 types of spectrum, you're going to have to have more numerous cell sites, frankly, over time. So that's still going to have to happen both for a capacity need, which is more [indiscernible] throughput as we talked about going to get that work and also the higher signal to call -- signal-to-noise call that you need to [indiscernible] travel as robustly. And secondly, we've got video, which requires much more powerful signal to be usable.

And my sense is that's probably a fair range looking forward in that market. With the $10 billion that the carriers just spend on spectrum in the markets, we know that they're going to want to get that deployed. And so we see 4G activity going on in the market. So a lot of good things are happening in India, but I don't think the mid-teens type of the rate that we're going to see in Q4 is something that we'll see long term.

So you're going to have probably half a dozen, at least, well-financed, scaled operators that can actually effectively and profitably deploy 4G across that vast country. So you got industry structure that's rationalizing. Secondly, spectrum and narrow bands and also very -- sort of fractionalized deployment of spectrum has been a limiting factor on mobile data deployment in India. That's been essentially cleaned up, if you will, or get rationalized with this latest auction and some of the smaller players either exiting, et cetera, giving those bigger players not only do have the financial capacity to do 4G, but now the spectrum position to do it effectively as well. So as a platform, you've got -- the industry, the spectrum in place to do it. And you've got a pattern of investments already by the carriers there that look a lot like those in the U.S. They're spending 15% to 20% of their revenue on capital expenditures similar to the U.S. did in its growth phase. There's $4.5 billion to $5 billion a year being spent in India by these carriers now. And they are -- they've got so much more to do because far below 25% of the subscribers have 3 or 4G. 75% to 85% of people in India are still literally on 2G, texting and talking on their phones. Incredible opportunity there. And then on top of everything else, you've got this catalyst of Reliance Jio out there sort of leading the market.

And appreciate that it's been largely amendments last year, it's been largely amendments this year. expected large amendments next year. But as I'm sure you can appreciate, investors are debating if that's a structural change on that something that simply timing and part of that is around small cell. And while appreciate the small cells are more expensive to build and is more efficient to deploy a macro, the [indiscernible] to some degree our capital-constrained as they do need to be building out small cells, and something assessed of items over the making the investment, one could argue that it seems to be self-splitting.

And the reality of how regional real estate managers and the mobile operators or regional network managers operate is that they get a budget every year. And they're going to use that budget, whether it's $5 million or $10 million or $50 million for their region for that period, they're going to use that budget on the most efficient way they can determine to solve the network issues that they have in front of them. And we've got pretty close experience with a lot of these folks. And their list of things to do seems to always exceed the budget they have awarded to them for that year. So there's always network needs to either increase capacity, improve coverage, and limit their own churn off, to meet growing demand, et cetera. And the list exceeds the budget. So the shakeout of amendments versus colos it's really what solves the most problems in that given year. And there's always more amendments and more colos than they can actually do. When it comes to small cells, as you just indicated, that's probably the least efficient, especially outdoor small cells, the least efficient option of these individuals to spend their budget. And so they spend that budget in the places only the times, only a small cells as a [indiscernible] when they have to do so. And so our experience on the total spend going to a macro site-type deployments versus small cell-type deployments, we've said in the past is around 5% of what we can see right now going to small cells and perhaps, over the next 5 years, that can go as high as 10% of the total with a total itself growing because of the percentage of revenue and revenue growing. So we really don't see wholesale shifts in the spending pattern or the habits of the people that we deal with in the field on the front line of the mobile operators. And hopefully, that addresses a question."

First of all, it really is an initiative that achieves objectives in all 3 of our sort of strategic pillars that we have in place for the last 15 years since I've been CEO here. The first of those pillars, it's to put ourselves in a situation where we can achieve strategic positioning in a leadership rank of independent tower companies or mobile infrastructure companies in all the most populous regions of the world, all right? And we have that in the U.S. We have that in Latin America. We have that in India. We have that in Africa. And in Europe, we'd like to pursue other avenues to achieve that as long as they meet our investment criteria. So for strategic positioning, PGGM is an excellent partner for us in the region to give us a wider window for potential expansion into the market -- again, if and only if we can meet our ATC investment criteria, which, as you know, is pretty strict. The second of our strategic pillars is to be -- in our aspiration, the top execution, experience and operator in this space in the world, right? I think PGGM has stepped up and validated with us that we are the partner of choice and that we can then team up with others with regional experience or regional positioning to try to achieve that growth aspiration. And thirdly, it's therapeutic to our balance sheet. We've always wanted a strong balance sheet along the way over the last 15 years. We've maintained investment-grade for many, many years, in spite of a growing the business very dramatically, as you've seen us do. And we are going to get proceeds from this that will both help our leverage position in the short term and allow us to redeploy it into newer growth opportunities in the mid to long term. So I think that, really, this arrangement hits all 3 of our strategic pillars: strategic positioning, validates our operational expertise and is conductive to our balance sheet strategy."

As far as our broadcast business, it's mid-single-digit percent of our revenue, a really solid piece of our business, which has very long-term contracts, as you know, in the TV and radio space. And with the incentive auctions going on now, they're going to be a few moving parts that we think we're really in an excellent position to sort of address and take advantage of. You may recall, 3 or 4 years ago, we acquired Richland Towers, which was, I guess, the second-largest independent in the space. And so we have a really solid position to help the broadcasters that either retain or divest some of the spectrum to stay on air, right? So they're going to have to have sites that are both simultaneously transmitting in the market while equipment is being taken down or put up. So we will have plenty of sites for them to move to in the process. And we'll be able to be, we think, the real estate provider of choice as this TV station shuffle of spectrum and channels goes through. So we think it's going to be a nice solid growth business, It's going to contribute to our U.S. operations for many years here. As far as the small deals that we're doing, it's the same disciplined investment process that we've had in place for years and years. We've got these very highly qualified teams, I would describe them as, across all the continents globally, that are continuing to always look for opportunities for us to invest and meet our criteria of those investments and get AFFO-accretive deals for us. And sometimes, those are big, like in Viom or Verizon or and sometimes those are modest size, like in South Africa. We are acquiring Eton Towers, adding about 300 sites to our portfolio. It makes a ton of sense for us tactically and strategically, and we'll go ahead and do those smaller deals. Now in Africa, as you saw from Tom's presentation, is one of our fastest-growing regions. Much like India, there's incredible need and demand, not only currently, but far into the future, for mobile service there. There are very low-cost handsets that are going to accelerate the adoption of 3 and 4G in people in those countries that really, really need it. And we've got kind of a pole position there. Certainly, in South Africa, we are the independent leader. In Nigeria, we're one of the top 2. In Ghana and Uganda, we are also the clear leader as independents, we feel. So we've got a really good strategic position in the country that we need to be in there, and the trends are going to be very similar for the mid to long term in Africa, as they will be in India, where we think we can sustain double-digit growth rates. And I also just want to further clarify, provide some color on Brett's question on the JV. I mean, we expect this JV to be platform for us to be able to expand in the region. And I'm not going to get into any the details relative to the JV agreement, but there's always a process within the agreement to the extent that the carriers aren't able to or don't desire to for one to be able to expand in the market without the other.

After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.

Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations for future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates, dividend growth, leverage and future operating performance as well as technology and industry trends and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.

So turning to Slide 4 of our presentation, I'll provide a few highlights from the third quarter. During the quarter, total property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.5 billion. Total revenue grew approximately 22% to over $1.51 billion, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by approximately 212% to $238 million or $0.55 per diluted common share. Further, adjusted EBITDA grew by more than 17% to approximately $915 million, and consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by nearly 15% to approximately $641 million or $1.49 per diluted share.

We had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and margin performance across our global asset base. In fact, achieving record levels of new business commencements in the quarter. 
Once again, we achieved double-digit growth rates across all of our key metrics. During the period, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.55 per share, which, for 2016, we are targeting to grow over 20% from the prior year. 
Simultaneously, we continued to diligently integrate the Viom assets while focusing on driving organic growth and scaling our business worldwide. We also achieved our year-end leverage target about 3 months ahead of schedule. 
If you please turn to Slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. Total reported property revenue growth was nearly 24%. This included totaled 10 billings growth of over 21%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent wireless customer demand for our real estate throughout our global footprint. As I mentioned, organic commenced new business in the quarter was at record levels, about 23% higher than the Q3 of last year, split almost evenly between our U.S. and international businesses. 
Our U.S. Property segment revenue growth was about 3.6% factoring in a negative 1.7% impact from straight line revenue recognition. In addition, we've booked about $0.5 million in decommissioning revenue this quarter, as compared to about $4 million recorded in Q3 of last year, resulting in an additional 50-basis-point negative impact to the growth rate. For the quarter, U.S. organic tenant billings growth was right in line with our expectations at 5.7%, reflecting a slight acceleration from Q2. Volume growth from colocations and amendments contributed about 4.4%, while pricing escalators contributed 2.8% and other run rate items contributed about 30 basis points. This was partially offset by churn of about 1.8%, of which the vast majority was associated with smaller, non-big 4 tenants. And as we disclosed last quarter, operational churn from the big 4 wireless carriers, what we call core networks in the U.S., which is defined as excluding activity on the former Clearwire network, has remained at about 30 basis points. Demand trends in the U.S. remained steady with carriers actively spending to augment the coverage and capacity of their 4G networks. 
Our international organic tenant billings growth was 13%, about 725 basis points higher than that of the U.S. While pricing escalators, driven by local CPI indices contributed about 7% to that growth. Volumes from colocations and amendments were an even larger component at about 7.3%. Other run rate items contributed an additional 40 basis points. These all were partially offset by churn of about 1.6%. There was broad strength across our international property segment, with all 3 achieving double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates for the sixth quarter in a row. 
Organic tenant billings growth was almost 14% in Latin America, 12% in EMEA and over 11% in Asia. Our large multinational tenants in all these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to affordable, advanced handsets and begin to use significantly more data on those handsets. And these network investments appeared to be catalyzing incremental usage as the mobile experience gets better and better. For example, a carrier deploying a new greenfield 4G wireless broadband network in India has reported that its customers on average are already using well over 1 gig of data per day on that network. 
Along with trends like this, we expect the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model to continue to drive strong growth rates for our international portfolio. 
Further, day 1 revenue associated with the nearly 46,000 sites we've added since the third quarter of last year, which includes the Viom portfolio and about 2,100 new builds, contributed another 13% to our global tenant billings growth in Q3. Our new build program remains active, and we constructed over 350 towers globally this quarter. While this level of build activity was a bit lower than historical levels, we would expect this trend to reverse and build activity to pick up again in Q4. Our newly build sites average an NOI yield of over 10% this quarter on a consolidated basis. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Gross margin in the quarter was nearly 68%, which was negatively impacted by past-through revenue and the addition of nearly 46,000 new, lower initial margin sites. In the quarter, adjusting for the impact of past-through, we converted more than 90% of revenue to gross margin on sites that we've owned for more than a year. This strong conversion performance generated rising NOI yields across our portfolio. The average NOI yield on international sites built to require up to and including 2009, for example, rose to 32%, while the NOI yield on site dated between 2010 and 2013 improved to 13%. And even on sites added in 2014 and later, including Viom, NOI yields are rising, improving sequentially to about 10%.  
We think we have a tremendous opportunity to increase these NOI yields over time, particularly on our younger assets. 
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60.4% for the quarter, which was similarly impacted by pass-through in new sites. 
Cash, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, declined to 7.4% in the quarter and is expected to be under 8% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on Slide 8. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew over 17% to approximately $915 million, and consolidated AFFO grew by nearly 15%, driven by a combination of the solid adjusted EBITDA growth, I just mentioned, and seasonally lower-than-expected capital improvement CapEx. We do expect higher levels of capital improvement CapEx in fourth quarter due to the underspend this quarter. Consolidated AFFO per share growth in the quarter was almost 14%, resulting in year-to-date AFFO per share growth of over 12%. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. In late September, for example, we raised a total of $1 billion in unsecured senior notes with a weighted average maturity of over 7 years and historically low coupon rates for ATC. This transaction increased our average debt tenor to 5.3 years, increased our proportion of fixed-rate debt, which is now 76% overall, and even higher for U.S. funded debt at 80%. This transaction also allowed us to continue our long-held strategy of paying down our outstanding bank debt, which is primarily being used to support past acquisitions. This allows us to maximize our financial flexibility. 
In addition, as at the end of the third quarter, we achieved our goal of reducing our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA to 5x, 3 months ahead of schedule. Longer term, our target leverage remains between 3x and 5x. In addition, we continue to be well protected from the impacts of potentially rising interest rates. In fact, the 25-basis-point increase in LIBOR would result in just a $9 million in impact to AFFO on an annualized basis. 
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid year-to-date performance, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and Q4 growth expectations that are broadly consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full-year guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our outlook for property revenue by $50 million or about 0.9%, resulting in projected full-year growth of almost 22% or just over $1 billion. The increase is being driven by about a $25 million increase in past-through revenue, and a $5 million increase in straight line revenue on an FX-neutral basis, with remaining upside being driven by favorability from foreign exchange rate trends. Principally, that was generated in Q3. As in the past, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from pending transactions. 
Within our total revenue projections, we continue to expect U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.8% for the year, which reflects a steady demand environment. Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of over 13%, supported by strong trends in markets like Mexico and Ghana. We do expect slightly lower full-year tenant billings growth in India, as compared to our prior outlook, primarily due to carriers temporarily pausing some of their activities as they are waiting for the recent spectrum auction to conclude. However, we anticipate that organic tenant billings growth in Asia will increase to the mid-teens level during Q4. 
At a consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Day 1 revenue from sites added in the last year is expected to contribute to the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year for just about 15%. The growth outlined above has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now stands at around $32.5 billion, with an average remaining lease term of 5.7 years on a consolidated basis, and about 6.4 years for our big 4 wireless customers in the U.S. 
We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, resulting in expected full-year growth of about 16% or roughly $500 million. The $25 million increase is being driven by a slight increase in net straight line, $15 million in FX favorability and roughly $10 million in expense management outperformance relative to our previous expectations for the property segment. This is being partially offset by a slightly lower expected contribution from our Services segment versus our prior outlook as a result of lower activity levels. 
Finally, we are raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $30 million or by over 1% at the midpoint, resulting in expected full-year growth of about 15% or about $320 million. This $30 million increase is being driven primarily by about a $20 million increase in cash EBITDA and roughly $10 million in lower net interest expense. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.75 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of over 13%. 
Before I move on, I'd also note that factoring in our October month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of over $20 million for property revenue, $10 million for adjusted EBITDA and about $5 million of consolidate AFFO relative to the midpoints of our revised outlook. 
Turning to Slide 11. So far in 2016, we've demonstrated an ability to simultaneously deleverage the balance sheet, deploy meaningful capital to both our CapEx and acquisition programs and continue to fund a common stock dividend, which is expected to grow over 20% versus the prior year. Much of this is attributable to the significant internal cash flow generation capacity of our business, which is illustrated on this slide. As you can see, on a full-year basis, our projected cash from operations of around $2.5 billion allows us to fully fund over $900 million in expected common stock dividends and more than $700 million in anticipated total capital expenditures, while at the same time leaving us around $1 billion of additional discretionary investment capacity. 
As a result, we've been able to close significant transactions like Viom as well as other smaller deals for a total of around $2.1 billion year-to-date, and still reach our leverage target of 5x, a full quarter earlier. This leaves us with around $300 million in incremental capacity for the fourth quarter. This estimate doesn't include any of the anticipated proceeds from our European JV transaction, which we announced earlier today. 
Going forward, we would expect the internal cash flow generation capacity of our business to expand further as we continue to drive the high-margin conversion ratios on our organic revenue growth throughout our global footprint. 
In combination with being able to lever our incremental adjusted EBITDA growth, we would expect to have significant recurring investment capacity going forward. 
In addition, as we announced this morning, we've signed an agreement to form a strategic joint venture in Europe with PGGM. The formation of this joint venture, in addition to aligning us with a high-quality partner, will free up even more cash for us to deploy throughout our higher-growth markets. In addition, the JV has been established to explore, evaluate and potentially invest in new markets opportunities in Europe. 
At closing, we will contribute our joint assets in ATC Europe and PGGM will acquire a 49% interest in this entity. American Tower will retain operational control and day-to-day oversight of the business. 
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year as our global business continues to generate solid growth across all of our key metrics. Our outlook now reflects consolidated AFFO per share growth of 13%, up from around 10% in our initial guidance provided in February. And we continue to expect dividend growth of over 20%. 
Looking forward, we believe we are poised to continue generating meaningful returns for investors for several key reasons: First, we are able to tap into the secular growth trend in mobile on a global scale, which we believe, when combined with our operational execution, will be the strong recurring growth across our existing asset base. Second, given our proven approach to capital allocation, a solid balance sheet with a capital structure within our targeted range and healthy free cash flow generation, we will have significant capacity to either invest in our business or return directly back to stockholders. And lastly, we believe we will continue to be able to generate strong growth in our common stock dividend. Putting this all together, we believe that we have built a dynamic, sustainable, long-term model for generating meaningful growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"
24766,403302112,1063559,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology. While the emphasis this morning is on the U.S., we expect similar trends to follow in other served markets. Mobile data usage continu",844,"Thanks, Tom. As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology. While the emphasis this morning is on the U.S., we expect similar trends to follow in other served markets. 
Mobile data usage continues to escalate rapidly. According to Cisco, the average U.S. smartphone now consumes more than 1.4 gigabits of data per month or a 1,700% increase from just 5 years ago. Video continues to power significant portion of that usage with advanced devices like the iPhone 7 and services like Go90, YouTube and Netflix. Consequently, total mobile data usage in the U.S. is now at more than 500 terabytes per month. Despite this, 4G penetration is estimated at only 60% to 65% in the U.S. today, indicating that there is still significant growth to come simply from the device upgrade cycle as subscribers acquire more advanced handsets. 
So to keep pace with the strain these trends create on mobile networks, the big 4 U.S. wireless carriers have consistently spent about $30 billion per year in CapEx since 2010, or roughly 15% of their total revenue on aggregate. And while the total spend has remained consistent, the per-gigabit cost for wireless carriers has dropped by more than 99% since 2005. This dramatic drop in expenses per gigabit has been supported through a combination of new spectrum, technology advancements and radio access network investments in these sites. We continue to believe that this level of capital intensity, which has been maintained over the last 10 years and has supported strong organic tenant billings growth for our business, is sustainable over the long term. 
In addition, over the past 5 years, the U.S. government has auctioned or otherwise made available close to 300 megahertz of new spectrum. We expect incremental spectrum assets, like AWS-3 and the WCS bands as well as the 700 megahertz spectrum that's been committed for the forthcoming public safety build-out, to be deployed over the next several years. 
As in the past, to fully capitalize on the availability of this spectrum, we anticipate that new antennas and radios will be placed on our towers, which should continue to help support healthy levels of growth for us in the U.S. 
We also expect the vast majority of these deployments in the near to medium term will take place on 4G macro tower networks, particularly given that the 5G standard isn't expected to be formalized until 2019. 
Meanwhile, technological advancements such as software-defined networks, self-optimizing networks and cloud RAN, among others, continue to focus primarily on the mobile core network. These advancements have enabled mobile carriers to achieve significant savings on their core network operations, bring up more resources for the radio access network that we support. 
At the same time, macro towers remain the most cost- and technologically-efficient solution for radio signal propagation in the vast majority of areas across our country. 
Looking forward, we expect that improved devices, greater 4G penetration, more and better applications and consumers' behavior will continue to drive mobile data usage at a 30% to 40% annual growth rate. In addition, the expanding role of the Internet of things, or IOT, will add further demands on mobile networks. In the near to midterm, this network burn will be shouldered by 4G technology. We expect that any near-term 5G deployments will be extremely short-range, essentially used for fixed wireless solutions. 
And furthermore, we expect that many early deployments of 5G will actually be indoors, where ATC is already a leading provider of indoor small cell networks today. Eventually, after the year 2020, we do think 5G technology will be widely applied for mobile applications, beginning first in dense urban areas, then spreading to suburban and rural areas predominately served by macro towers. This timeline also coincides with the clearing process of the 600 megahertz spectrum that's currently being auctioned. To the extent that this spectrum is in fact used for a broad 5G coverage build-out, we believe it could be a significant benefit for our tower business, given the large size and substantial way the antennas required for optimal use of low band spectrum like 600 megahertz. 
To the extent you'd like some additional information on the evolution of 4G and the potential impacts of 5G on our business, I'd encourage all of you to reference the presentation we have posted on the company and industry resources section of the American Tower Investor Relations website. 
So to summarize, we believe that the U.S. is still probably in the fifth or sixth inning of 4G deployments and that further 4G equipment installations will still be largely on macro towers. In 5G, while initially a primarily fixed wireless broadband technology to compete with the likes of cable, is likely to eventually be deployed for mobile services across our macro tower infrastructure that mainly serves suburban and rural areas where most Americans live and commute. As a result, we expect to generate solid growth in the U.S. market for years to come. 
So with that, operator, please open the call up for questions."

So we expect amendments and a mix of colocations going forward based on that new high-band spectrum being put into place. As the FirstNet's 700 megahertz spectrum, there's a schedule to be a winner of the competition with the government selecting next month, in November. We are led to understand that based on the schedule that's out there today, that would infer probably mid-2017 and beyond deployment of actual equipment. And depending on the winner of the architecture and the rollout plan, we'd be able to comment further in the next few months on any impacts to our business, but we'd expect them to be in a positive direction."

Most of the country -- it's further public announcements has reasonably solid coverage across all 4 of the major U.S. national carriers. And there's a lot of capacity work that still needs to be done now. And the other piece of this, as I said, it's got higher-band spectrum and much more video content being run across the network, which indicates that you're going to have to have cell sites closer together. For the high-band spectrum simply because when you do carrier aggregation, you're also going to have to solve for the lowest common denominator of spectrum, meaning the shortest transmission range. And as you get into 1.9, 2.1, 2.5 types of spectrum, you're going to have to have more numerous cell sites, frankly, over time. So that's still going to have to happen both for a capacity need, which is more bits of throughput as we talked about going through that network, and also the higher signal-to-call -- signal-to-noise quality that you need because the spectrum doesn't travel as robustly. And secondly, you've got video, which requires much more powerful signal to be usable. So we still think there's, again, 3 or 4 good, solid innings, if not more, of 4G capacity and edge coverage deployment in front of us in the United States.

And I would expect that typical type of trend to occur over the next 6 to 12 months. We'll see what kind of impacts the -- some of the spectrum being deployed that Jim mentioned before. 
And with regards to India, we do expect a heightened activity in Q4. If you take a look at over the last 6 to 8 quarters in Asia, Tim, we've been in kind of that 10% to 13% kind of growth range on a organic kind of billings basis. And my sense is that's probably a fair range looking forward in that market. With the $10 billion that the carriers just spend on spectrum in the market, we know that they're going to want to get that deployed. And so we see 4G activity going on in the market. So a lot of good things are happening in India, but I don't think the mid-teens type of the rate that we're going to see in Q4 is something that we'll see long term. I think it will revert back to some of the more traditional kind of 10% to 12% kind of growth rates."

So you're going to have probably half a dozen, at least, well-financed, scaled operators that can actually effectively and profitably deploy 4G across that vast country. So you've got a industry structure that's rationalizing. 
Secondly, spectrum and narrow bands and also very -- sort of fractionalized deployment of spectrum has been a limiting factor on mobile data deployment in India. That's been essentially cleaned up, if you will, or get rationalized with this latest auction and some of the smaller players either exiting, et cetera, giving those bigger players not only the financial capacity to do 4G, but now the spectrum position to do it effectively as well. 
So as a platform, you've got the industry and the spectrum in place to do it. And you've got a pattern of investments already by the carriers there that look a lot like those in the U.S. They're spending 15% to 20% of their revenue on capital expenditures similar to as of U.S. did during its growth phase. There's $4.5 billion to $5 billion a year being spent in India by these carriers now. And they're -- they've got so much work to do because far below 25% of the subscribers have 3G or 4G. 75% to 85% of people in India are still literally on 2G, texting and talking on their phones. There's incredible opportunity there. And then on top of everything else, you've got this catalyst of Reliance Jio out there sort of leading the market. So this low double-digit growth rate, as Tom suggested, we think can be sustained for quite sometime."

And we'll look to bring that cash back and reinvest it, as we talked about it, in some other high-growth opportunities. We'll have additional capacity, as I also mentioned, because we would achieve our target leverage kind of 90 days before we had thought. So that will leave us with roughly $300 million capacity, and then we'll have this additional EUR 250 million. So we feel good about how we're ending the year, where we are from the balance sheet perspective. 
On the FX side, you're right. As I've always kind of said, we know we're going to be wrong in terms of how we look at FX, but we are consistent. And so the forecast that we've used for the balance of the year is exactly as you laid out. It's more conservative of what's the year-end forecast would be that we find on, that we see the banks put out on Bloomberg over the last 90 days of an average spot rate. And so we've been very consistent with that. So the upside that we have included now in our outlook really includes the FX benefits that we generated versus our previous outlook in Q3. And so they're very little incremental Q4 FX upside in our outlook. So just get it, we just want to be very consistent and very transparent in terms of outlook at FX. It's well documented in our disclosures. And that's why then, even in the remarks that I made, we talked about some of the additional upside, Dave, that we might have relative to the rates continuing as they are, spot rates for the balance of the year, and now with that $20 million, I think, upside of revenue, which is principally coming from the real. You're right. It's significantly -- the spot is significantly below where the forecasted rate is. And it has been over a year, and that has provided us less headwinds, if you will, for the year and perhaps some upside for Q4. And then the -- you have some questions, Dave. What was the last one?"

And while I appreciate the small cells are more expensive to build and it's more efficient to deploy a macro, that carries to some degree of capital constraint, and if they do need to be building out small cells, and something else has to go in terms of where they're making the investment, one could argue that it seems to be self-splitting.

And the reality of how regional real estate managers and the mobile operators or regional network managers operate is that they get a budget every year. And they're going to use that budget, whether it's $5 million or $10 million or $50 million for their region for that period. They're going to use that budget in the most efficient way they can determine to solve the network issues that they have in front of them. And we've got pretty close experience with a lot of these folks. And their list of things to do seems to always exceed the budget they have awarded to them for that year. So there's always network needs to increase capacity, improve coverage, limit their own churn off, to meet growing demand, et cetera. And the list exceeds the budget. So the shakeout of amendments versus colos it's really what solves the most problems in that given year. And there's always more amendments and more colos than they can actually do. When it comes to small cells, as you just indicated, that's probably the least efficient, especially outdoor small cells, the least efficient option of these individuals to spend their budget. And so they spend that budget in the places only and at the times only on small cells as we -- as our experience, when they have to do so. 
And so our experience on the total spend going to a macro site-type deployments versus small cell-type deployments, we've said in the past is about 5% of what we can see right now going to small cells and perhaps, over the next 5 years, that can go as high as 10% of the total with the total itself growing because of the percentage of revenue and revenue growing. So we really don't see wholesale shifts in the spending pattern or the habits of the people that we deal with in the field on the front line of the mobile operators. And hopefully, that addresses your question."

First of all, it really is an initiative that achieves objectives in all 3 of our sort of strategic pillars that we had in place for the last 15 years since I've been CEO here. The first of those pillars, it's to put ourselves in a situation where we can achieve strategic positioning in a leadership rank of independent tower companies or mobile infrastructure companies in all the most populous regions of the world, all right? And we have that in the U.S. We have that in Latin America. We have that in India. We have that in Africa. And in Europe, we'd like to pursue other avenues to achieve that as long as they meet our investment criteria. 
So for strategic positioning, PGGM is an excellent partner for us in the region to give us a wider window for potential expansion into the market, if we -- again if and only if we can meet our ATC investment criteria, which, as you know, is pretty strict. 
The second of our strategic pillars is to be -- in our aspiration, the top execution, experience and operator in this space in the world, right? I think PGGM has stepped up and validated with us that we are that operating partner of choice and that we can then team up with others with regional experience or regional positioning to try to achieve that growth aspiration. And thirdly, it's therapeutic to our balance sheet. We've always wanted a strong balance sheet along the way over the last 15 years. We've maintained investment-grade for many, many years, in spite of growing the business very dramatically, as you've seen us do. And we are going to get proceeds from this that will both help our leverage position in the short term and allow us to redeploy it into newer growth opportunities in the mid to long term. So I think that, really, this arrangement hits all 3 of our strategic pillars: strategic positioning, validates our operational expertise and is conductive to our balance sheet strategy."

And we'll be able to be, we think, the real estate provider of choice as this TV station shuffle of a spectrum and channels goes through. 
So we think it's going to be a nice solid growth business, It's going to contribute to our U.S. operations for many years here. 
As far as the small deals that we're doing, it's the same disciplined investment process that we've had in place for years and years. We've got these very highly qualified teams, I would describe them as, across all the continents globally, that are continuing to always look for opportunities for us to invest and meet our criteria of those investments and get AFFO-accretive deals for us. And sometimes, those are big, like in Viom or Verizon or GDP and sometimes those are modest size, like in South Africa, we are acquiring Eaton Towers, adding about 300 sites to our portfolio. It makes a ton of sense for us tactically and strategically, and we'll go ahead and do those smaller deals. 
Now in Africa, as you saw from Tom's presentation, is one of our fastest growing regions. Much like India, there's incredible need and demand, not only currently, but far into the future, for mobile service there. There are very low-cost handsets that are going to accelerate the adoption of 3G and 4G for people in those countries that really, really need it. And we've got kind of a pole position there. Certainly, in South Africa, we are the independent leader. In Nigeria, we're one of the top 2. In Ghana and Uganda, we are also the clear leader as independents, we feel. So we've got a really good strategic positioning in the countries that we think we need to be in there, and the trends are going to be very similar for the mid to long term in Africa, as they will be in India, where we think we can sustain double-digit growth rates."

So turning to Slide 4 of our presentation, I'll provide a few highlights from the third quarter. During the quarter, total property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.5 billion. Total revenue grew approximately 22% to over $1.51 billion, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by approximately 212% to $238 million or $0.55 per diluted common share. Further, adjusted EBITDA grew by more than 17% to approximately $915 million, and consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by nearly 15% to approximately $641 million or $1.49 per diluted share. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. We had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and margin performance across our global asset base.

We had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and margin performance across our global asset base. In fact, achieving record levels of new business commencements in the quarter. 
Once again, we achieved double-digit growth rates across all of our key metrics. During the period, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.55 per share, which, for 2016, we are targeting to grow over 20% from the prior year. 
Simultaneously, we continued to diligently integrate the Viom assets while focusing on driving organic growth and scaling our business worldwide. We also achieved our year-end leverage target about 3 months ahead of schedule. 
If you please turn to Slide 6. Let's take a look at our quarterly results. Total reported property revenue growth was nearly 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 21%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent wireless customer demand for our real estate throughout our global footprint. As I mentioned, organic commenced new business in the quarter was at record levels, about 23% higher than the Q3 of last year, split almost evenly between our U.S. and international businesses. 
Our U.S. Property segment revenue growth was about 3.6% factoring in a negative 1.7% impact from straight line revenue recognition. In addition, we booked about $0.5 million in decommissioning revenue this quarter, as compared to about $4 million recorded in Q3 of last year, resulting in an additional 50-basis-point negative impact to the growth rate. 
For the quarter, U.S. organic tenant billings growth was right in line with our expectations at 5.7%, reflecting a slight acceleration from Q2. Volume growth from colocations and amendments contributed about 4.4%, while pricing escalators contributed 2.8% and other run rate items contributed about 30 basis points. This was partially offset by churn of about 1.8%, of which the vast majority was associated with smaller, non-big 4 tenants. And as we disclosed last quarter, operational churn from the big 4 wireless carriers, what we call core networks in the U.S., which is defined as excluding activity on the former Clearwire network, has remained at about 30 basis points. Demand trends in the U.S. remained steady with carriers actively spending to augment the coverage and capacity of their 4G networks. 
Our international organic tenant billings growth was 13%, about 725 basis points higher than that of the U.S. While pricing escalators, driven by local CPI indices, contributed about 7% to that growth. Volumes from colocations and amendments were an even larger component at about 7.3%. Other run rate items contributed an additional 40 basis points. These all were partially offset by churn of about 1.6%. There was broad strength across our international property segment, with all 3 achieving double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates for the sixth quarter in a row. 
Organic tenant billings growth was almost 14% in Latin America, 12% in EMEA and over 11% in Asia. Our large multinational tenants in all these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to affordable, advanced handsets and begin to use significantly more data on those handsets. And these network investments appeared to be catalyzing incremental usage as the mobile experience gets better and better. For example, a carrier deploying a new greenfield 4G wireless broadband network in India has reported that its customers on average are already using well over 1 gig of data per day on that network. 
Along with trends like this, we expect the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model to continue to drive strong growth rates for our international portfolio. 
Further, day 1 revenue associated with the nearly 46,000 sites we've added since the third quarter of last year, which includes the Viom portfolio and about 2,100 new builds, contributed another 13% to our global tenant billings growth in Q3. Our new build program remains active, and we constructed over 350 towers globally this quarter. While this level of build activity was a bit lower than historical levels, we would expect this trend to reverse and build activity to pick up again in Q4. Our newly build sites average an NOI yield of over 10% this quarter on a consolidated basis. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Gross margin in the quarter was nearly 68%, which was negatively impacted by past-through revenue and the addition of nearly 46,000 new, lower initial margin sites. In the quarter, adjusting for the impact of past-through, we converted more than 90% of revenue to gross margin on sites that we've owned for more than a year. This strong conversion performance generated rising NOI yields across our portfolio. The average NOI yield on international sites built to require up to and including 2009, for example, rose to 32%, while the NOI yield on site dated between 2010 and 2013 improved to 13%. And even on sites added in 2014 and later, including Viom, NOI yields are rising, improving sequentially to about 10%.  
We think we have a tremendous opportunity to increase these NOI yields over time, particularly on our younger assets. 
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60.4% for the quarter, which was similarly impacted by pass-through in new sites. 
Cash, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, declined to 7.4% in the quarter and is expected to be under 8% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on Slide 8. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew over 17% to approximately $915 million, and consolidated AFFO grew by nearly 15%, driven by a combination of the solid adjusted EBITDA growth, I just mentioned, and seasonally lower-than-expected capital improvement CapEx. We do expect higher levels of capital improvement CapEx in fourth quarter due to the underspend this quarter. Consolidated AFFO per share growth in the quarter was almost 14%, resulting in year-to-date AFFO per share growth of over 12%. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. In late September, for example, we raised a total of $1 billion in unsecured senior notes with a weighted average maturity of over 7 years and historically low coupon rates for ATC. This transaction increased our average debt tenor to 5.3 years, increased our proportion of fixed-rate debt, which is now 76% overall, and even higher for U.S. funded debt at 80%. This transaction also allowed us to continue our long-held strategy of paying down our outstanding bank debt, which is primarily being used to support past acquisitions. This allows us to maximize our financial flexibility. 
In addition, as at the end of the third quarter, we achieved our goal of reducing our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA to 5x, 3 months ahead of schedule. Longer term, our target leverage remains between 3x and 5x. In addition, we continue to be well protected from the impacts of potentially rising interest rates. In fact, the 25-basis-point increase in LIBOR would result in just a $9 million in impact to AFFO on an annualized basis. 
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid year-to-date performance, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and Q4 growth expectations that are broadly consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full-year guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our outlook for property revenue by $50 million or about 0.9%, resulting in projected full-year growth of almost 22% or just over $1 billion. The increase is being driven by about a $25 million increase in past-through revenue, and a $5 million increase in straight line revenue on an FX-neutral basis, with remaining upside being driven by favorability from foreign exchange rate trends. Principally, that was generated in Q3. As in the past, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from pending transactions. 
Within our total revenue projections, we continue to expect U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.8% for the year, which reflects a steady demand environment. Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of over 13%, supported by strong trends in markets like Mexico and Ghana. We do expect slightly lower full-year tenant billings growth in India, as compared to our prior outlook, primarily due to carriers temporarily pausing some of their activities as they are waiting for the recent spectrum auction to conclude. However, we anticipate that organic tenant billings growth in Asia will increase to the mid-teens level during Q4. 
At a consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Day 1 revenue from sites added in the last year is expected to contribute to the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year for just about 15%. The growth outlined above has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now stands at around $32.5 billion, with an average remaining lease term of 5.7 years on a consolidated basis and about 6.4 years for our big 4 wireless customers in the U.S. 
We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, resulting in expected full-year growth of about 16% or roughly $500 million. The $25 million increase is being driven by a slight increase in net straight line, $15 million in FX favorability and roughly $10 million in expense management outperformance relative to our previous expectations for the property segment. This is being partially offset by a slightly lower expected contribution from our Services segment versus our prior outlook as a result of lower activity levels. 
Finally, we are raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $30 million or by over 1% at the midpoint, resulting an expected full-year growth of about 15% or about $320 million. This $30 million increase is being driven primarily by about a $20 million increase in cash EBITDA and roughly $10 million in lower net interest expense. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429.5 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.75 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of over 13%. 
Before I move on, I'd also note that factoring in our October month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of over $20 million for property revenue, $10 million for adjusted EBITDA and about $5 million of consolidate AFFO relative to the midpoints of our revised outlook. 
Turning to Slide 11. So far in 2016, we've demonstrated an ability to simultaneously deleverage the balance sheet, deploy meaningful capital to both our CapEx and acquisition programs and continue to fund a common stock dividend, which is expected to grow over 20% versus the prior year. Much of this is attributable to the significant internal cash flow generation capacity of our business, which is illustrated on this slide. As you can see, on a full-year basis, our projected cash from operations of around $2.5 billion allows us to fully fund over $900 million in expected common stock dividends and more than $700 million in anticipated total capital expenditures, while at the same time leaving us around $1 billion of additional discretionary investment capacity. 
As a result, we've been able to close significant transactions like Viom as well as other smaller deals for a total of around $2.1 billion year-to-date, and still reach our leverage target of 5x, a full quarter earlier. This leaves us with around $300 million in incremental capacity for the fourth quarter. This estimate doesn't include any of the anticipated proceeds from our European JV transaction, which we announced earlier today. 
Going forward, we would expect the internal cash flow generation capacity of our business to expand further as we continue to drive the high-margin conversion ratios on our organic revenue growth throughout our global footprint. 
In combination with being able to lever our incremental adjusted EBITDA growth, we would expect to have significant recurring investment capacity going forward. 
In addition, as we announced this morning, we've signed an agreement to form a strategic joint venture in Europe with PGGM. The formation of this joint venture, in addition to aligning us with a high-quality partner, will free up even more cash for us to deploy throughout our higher-growth markets. In addition, the JV has been established to explore, evaluate and potentially invest in new markets opportunities in Europe. 
At closing, we will contribute our joint assets in ATC Europe and PGGM will acquire a 49% interest in this entity. American Tower will retain operational control and day-to-day oversight of the business. 
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year as our global business continues to generate solid growth across all of our key metrics. Our outlook now reflects consolidated AFFO per share growth of 13%, up from around 10% in our initial guidance provided in February. And we continue to expect dividend growth of over 20%. 
Looking forward, we believe we are poised to continue generating meaningful returns for investors for several key reasons: First, we are able to tap into the secular growth trend in mobile on a global scale, which we believe, when combined with our operational execution, will be the strong recurring growth across our existing asset base. Second, given our proven approach to capital allocation, a solid balance sheet with a capital structure within our targeted range and healthy free cash flow generation, we will have significant capacity to either invest in our business or return directly back to stockholders. And lastly, we believe we will continue to be able to generate strong growth in our common stock dividend. Putting this all together, we believe that we have built a dynamic, sustainable, long-term model for generating meaningful growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"
24766,403302112,1063874,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology. While the emphasis this morning is on the U.S., we expect similar trends to follow in other served markets. Mobile data usage continu",844,"Thanks, Tom. As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology. While the emphasis this morning is on the U.S., we expect similar trends to follow in other served markets. 
Mobile data usage continues to escalate rapidly. According to Cisco, the average U.S. smartphone now consumes more than 1.4 gigabits of data per month or a 1,700% increase from just 5 years ago. Video continues to power significant portion of that usage with advanced devices like the iPhone 7 and services like Go90, YouTube and Netflix. Consequently, total mobile data usage in the U.S. is now at more than 500 terabytes per month. Despite this, 4G penetration is estimated at only 60% to 65% in the U.S. today, indicating that there is still significant growth to come simply from the device upgrade cycle as subscribers acquire more advanced handsets. 
So to keep pace with the strain these trends create on mobile networks, the big 4 U.S. wireless carriers have consistently spent about $30 billion per year in CapEx since 2010, or roughly 15% of their total revenue on aggregate. And while the total spend has remained consistent, the per-gigabit cost for wireless carriers has dropped by more than 99% since 2005. This dramatic drop in expenses per gigabit has been supported through a combination of new spectrum, technology advancements and radio access network investments in these sites. We continue to believe that this level of capital intensity, which has been maintained over the last 10 years and has supported strong organic tenant billings growth for our business, is sustainable over the long term. 
In addition, over the past 5 years, the U.S. government has auctioned or otherwise made available close to 300 megahertz of new spectrum. We expect incremental spectrum assets, like AWS-3 and the WCS bands as well as the 700 megahertz spectrum that's been committed for the forthcoming public safety build-out, to be deployed over the next several years. 
As in the past, to fully capitalize on the availability of this spectrum, we anticipate that new antennas and radios will be placed on our towers, which should continue to help support healthy levels of growth for us in the U.S. 
We also expect the vast majority of these deployments in the near to medium term will take place on 4G macro tower networks, particularly given that the 5G standard isn't expected to be formalized until 2019. 
Meanwhile, technological advancements such as software-defined networks, self-optimizing networks and cloud RAN, among others, continue to focus primarily on the mobile core network. These advancements have enabled mobile carriers to achieve significant savings on their core network operations, bring up more resources for the radio access network that we support. 
At the same time, macro towers remain the most cost- and technologically-efficient solution for radio signal propagation in the vast majority of areas across our country. 
Looking forward, we expect that improved devices, greater 4G penetration, more and better applications and consumers' behavior will continue to drive mobile data usage at a 30% to 40% annual growth rate. In addition, the expanding role of the Internet of things, or IOT, will add further demands on mobile networks. In the near to midterm, this network burn will be shouldered by 4G technology. We expect that any near-term 5G deployments will be extremely short-range, essentially used for fixed wireless solutions. 
And furthermore, we expect that many early deployments of 5G will actually be indoors, where ATC is already a leading provider of indoor small cell networks today. Eventually, after the year 2020, we do think 5G technology will be widely applied for mobile applications, beginning first in dense urban areas, then spreading to suburban and rural areas predominately served by macro towers. This timeline also coincides with the clearing process of the 600 megahertz spectrum that's currently being auctioned. To the extent that this spectrum is in fact used for a broad 5G coverage build-out, we believe it could be a significant benefit for our tower business, given the large size and substantial way the antennas required for optimal use of low band spectrum like 600 megahertz. 
To the extent you'd like some additional information on the evolution of 4G and the potential impacts of 5G on our business, I'd encourage all of you to reference the presentation we have posted on the company and industry resources section of the American Tower Investor Relations website. 
So to summarize, we believe that the U.S. is still probably in the fifth or sixth inning of 4G deployments and that further 4G equipment installations will still be largely on macro towers. In 5G, while initially a primarily fixed wireless broadband technology to compete with the likes of cable, is likely to eventually be deployed for mobile services across our macro tower infrastructure that mainly serves suburban and rural areas where most Americans live and commute. As a result, we expect to generate solid growth in the U.S. market for years to come. 
So with that, operator, please open the call up for questions."

They're going to -- we think being much more robust through 2017, again. And similarly, and maybe a little bit beyond that for WCS. I'll pause on those 2 for a second because they're relatively high-band spectrum to be augmenting what's out there today. Ultimately, that means that in addition to -- on many sites, not necessarily all sites, but many sites, there'll be amendments, there'll also need to be eventually, a closer and more numerous array of transmission points to get the same signal quality from higher-band spectrum such as this versus what's out there again deployed today in the 700, 800 band. So we expect amendments and a mix of colocations going forward based on that new high-band spectrum being put into place. As to FirstNet's 700 megahertz spectrum, there is a schedule to be a winner of the competition with the government selecting that next month, in November, we are led to understand. But based on the schedule that's out there today, that would infer probably mid-2017 and beyond deployment of actual equipment. And depending on the winner of the architecture and the rollout plan, we'd be able to comment further in the next few months on any impacts to our business. But we'd expect them to be in a positive direction."

But we've only found one opportunity in Germany with KPN a few years ago, where we can meet our investment criteria as far as asset pricing and then the characteristics that we thought the business would evolve to over time, some relatively lower growth market. Our price points need to reflect that when we do asset purchases, and we'd like to and hope that there'll be more opportunities to achieve that over the next few years, Amir. What this joint venture sets us up to do is should we -- and our partners at PGGM believe that we have a good opportunity, we'll be able to finance it much more efficiently. We could, in theory, do a large-scale move in Europe with our partner with much less strain on our own balance sheet potentially. And PGGM is very attractive to us because not only have they been a long-term investor across many industries in Europe, so we get the benefit of their insights on the region, they've also been very active in the tower space over the years. And we've dealt with them before. So we think we've got the best partner to ride along with us as we continue to evaluate and hope to find some European investments over the next few years that meet our investment criteria."

Most of the country it's -- further public announcements has reasonably solid coverage across all 4 of the major U.S. national carriers. And there's a lot of capacity work that still needs to be done now. And the other piece of this, as I said, it's got higher-band spectrum and much more video content being run across the network which indicates that you're going to have to have cell sites closer together. For the high-band spectrum simply because when you do carrier aggregation, you're also going to have to solve for the lowest common denominator of spectrum, meaning the shortest transmission range. And as you get into 1.9, 2.1, 2.5 types of spectrum, you're going to have to have more numerous cell sites, frankly, over time. So that's still going to have to happen both for a capacity need, which is more bits of throughput as we talked about going through that network, and also the higher signal-to-call -- signal-to-noise quality that you need because the spectrum doesn't travel as robustly. And secondly, you've got video, which requires much more powerful signal to be usable. So we still think there's, again, 3 or 4 good, solid innings, if not more, of 4G capacity and edge coverage deployment in front of us in the United States. The amendments and the colocations, Tom, you can give the latest number on that."

And with regards to India, we do expect a heightened activity in Q4. If you take a look at over the last 6 to 8 quarters in Asia, Tim, we've been in kind of that 10% to 13% kind of growth range on an organic kind of billings basis. And my sense is that's probably a fair range looking forward in that market. With the $10 billion that the carriers just spend on spectrum in the market, we know that they're going to want to get that deployed. And so we see 4G activity going on in the market. So a lot of good things are happening in India, but I don't think the mid-teens type of the rate that we're going to see in Q4 is something that we'll see long term. I think it will revert back to some of the more traditional kind of 10% to 12% kind of growth rates."

And I think to support those kind of 10% to 12% growth rates in a market like India, if you look at some of the real fundamentals there, first of all, the industry structure is rationalizing and becoming sustainable for long-term investment, right? So you're going to have probably half a dozen, at least, well-financed, scaled operators that can actually effectively and profitably deploy 4G across that vast country. So you've got an industry structure that's rationalizing. 
Secondly, spectrum and narrow bands and also very -- sort of fractionalized deployment of spectrum has been a limiting factor on mobile data deployment in India. That's been essentially cleaned up, if you will, or get rationalized with this latest auction and some of the smaller players either exiting, et cetera, giving those bigger players not only the financial capacity to do 4G, but now the spectrum position to do it effectively as well. 
So as a platform, you've got the industry and the spectrum in place to do it. And you've got a pattern of investments already by the carriers there that look a lot like those in the U.S. They're spending 15% to 20% of their revenue on capital expenditures similar to as of U.S. did during its growth phase. There's $4.5 billion to $5 billion a year being spent in India by these carriers now. And they're -- they've got so much work to do because far below 25% of the subscribers have 3G or 4G. 75% to 85% of people in India are still literally on 2G, texting and talking on their phones. There's incredible opportunity there. And then on top of everything else, you've got this catalyst of Reliance Jio out there sort of leading the market. So this low double-digit growth rate, as Tom suggested, we think can be sustained for quite some time."

And we'll look to bring that cash back and reinvest it, as we talked about it, in some other high-growth opportunities. We'll have additional capacity, as I also mentioned, because we would achieve our target leverage kind of 90 days before we had thought. So that will leave us with roughly $300 million capacity, and then we'll have this additional EUR 250 million. So we feel good about how we're ending the year, where we are from the balance sheet perspective. 
On the FX side, you're right. As I've always kind of said, we know we're going to be wrong in terms of how we look at FX, but we're consistent. And so the forecast that we've used for the balance of the year is exactly as you laid out. It's the more conservative of what's the year-end forecast would be that we find on, that we see the banks put out on Bloomberg over the last 90 days of an average spot rate. And so we've been very consistent with that. So the upside that we have included now in our outlook really includes the FX benefits that we generated versus our previous outlook in Q3. And so there are very little incremental Q4 FX upside in our outlook. So as I said, we just want to be very consistent and very transparent in terms of outlook at FX. It's well documented in our disclosures. And that's why then, even in the remarks that I made, we talked about some of the additional upside, Dave, that we might have relative to the rates continuing as they are, spot rates for the balance of the year, and now with that $20 million, I think, upside of revenue, which is principally coming from the real. You're right. It's significantly -- the spot is significantly below where the forecasted rate is. And it has been over a year, and that has provided us less headwinds, if you will, for the year and perhaps some upside for Q4. And then the -- you had so many questions, Dave.

Our goal, as I've said, is to achieve the most value for our assets and for our investors while also providing a path to the mobile operator for the most efficient life-cycle cost for the deployment of the infrastructure that they expect they're going to need and try to find that common ground. And so that's what we will always continue to do. And it will take different forms of agreement and then it will take different timing of agreement based on the specific carrier's interest and needs."

And I'm just curious if your expectation will be that should continue? I guess, more specifically, if there's any other consolidation or iDen churn out there that we should be still thinking about. Just a reminder on that if we're going to get back to normal levels. And then you've touched on a little bit already on the call, but this thought around amendments versus new colo opportunity. And I appreciate that it's been largely amendments last year, it's been largely amendments this year. It's expected to be largely amendments next year. But as I'm sure you can appreciate investors are debating if that's a structural change or if that is something that's simply timing and part of that is around small cells. And while I appreciate that small cells are more expensive to build and it's more efficient to deploy a macro, the carries to some degree are capital constrained. And if they do need to be building out small cells, and something else has to go in terms of where they're making the investment, one could argue that it seems to be cell-splitting. And I'm just curious where the confidence comes from that you think at some point we will see the cell-splitting aspect kind of come back into vogue?"

And the reality of how regional real estate managers and the mobile operators or regional network managers operate, is that they get a budget every year. And they're going to use that budget, whether it's $5 million or $10 million or $50 million for their region for that period, they're going to use that budget in the most efficient way they can determine to solve the network issues that they have in front of them. And we've got pretty close experience with a lot of these folks. And there are a list of things to do seems to always exceed the budget they have awarded to them for that year. So there's always network needs to increase capacity, improve coverage, limit their own churn off, to meet growing demand, et cetera. And the list exceeds the budget. So the shakeout of amendments versus colos, it's really what solves the most problems in that given year. And there's always more amendments and more colos that they can actually do. When it comes to small cells, you just indicated that's probably the least efficient, especially outdoor small cells, the least efficient option of these individuals to spend their budget. And so they spend that budget in the places only and at the times only on small cells as we -- as our experience, when they have to do so. And so our experience on the total spend going to a macro site-type deployments versus small cell-type deployments, we've said in the past is about 5% of what we can see right now going to small cells and perhaps, over the next 5 years, that can go as high as 10% of the total, with the total itself growing because of the percentage of revenue and revenue growing. So we really don't see wholesale shifts in the spending pattern or the habits of the people that we deal with in the field on the front line of the mobile operators. And hopefully that addresses your question."

First of all, it really is an initiative that achieves objectives in all 3 of our sort of strategic pillars that we had in place for the last 15 years since I've been CEO here. The first of those pillars is to put ourselves in a situation where we can achieve strategic positioning in a leadership rank of independent tower companies or mobile infrastructure companies in all the most populous regions of the world, all right? And we have that in the U.S. We have that in Latin America. We have that in India. We have that in Africa. And in Europe, we'd like to pursue other avenues to achieve that as long as they meet our investment criteria. So for strategic positioning, PGGM is an excellent partner for us in the region to give us a wider window for potential expansion into the market, if we -- again if and only if we can meet our ATC investment criteria, which as you know, is pretty strict. The second of our strategic pillars is to be -- in our aspiration, the top execution, experience and operator in this space in the world, right? I think PGGM has stepped up and validated with us that we are that operating partner of choice and that we can then team up with others with regional experience or regional positioning to try to achieve that growth aspiration. And thirdly, it's therapeutic to our balance sheet. We've always wanted a strong balance sheet along the way over the last 15 years. We've maintained investment-grade for many, many years, in spite of growing the business very dramatically, as you've seen us do. And we are going to get proceeds from this that will both help our leverage position in the short term and allow us to redeploy it into newer growth opportunities in the mid to long term. So I think that, really, this arrangement hits all 3 of our strategic pillars: strategic positioning, validates our operational expertise and is conductive to our balance sheet strategy."

As far as our broadcast business, it's mid-single-digit percent of our revenue, a really solid piece of our business, which has very long-term contracts, as you know, in the TV and radio space. And with the incentive auctions going on now, there are going to be a few moving parts that we think we're in a really excellent position to sort of address and take advantage of. 
You may recall, 3 or 4 years ago, we acquired Richland Towers, which was, I guess, the second largest independent in the space. And so we have a really solid position to help the broadcasters that either retain or divest some of their spectrum to stay on air, right? So they're going to have to have sites that are both simultaneously transmitting in the market while equipment is being taken down or put up. So we will have plenty of sites for them to move to in the process. And we'll be able to be, we think, the real estate provider of choice as this TV station shuffle of a spectrum and channels goes through. 
So we think it's going to be a nice solid growth business, it's going to contribute to our U.S. operations for many years here. 
As far as the small deals that we're doing, it's the same disciplined investment process that we've had in place for years and years. We've got these very highly qualified teams, I would describe them as, across all the continents globally, that are continuing to always look for opportunities for us to invest and meet our criteria of those investments and get AFFO-accretive deals for us. And sometimes, those are big, like in Viom or Verizon or GDP and sometimes those are modest size, like in South Africa, we are acquiring Eaton Towers, adding about 300 sites to our portfolio. It makes a ton of sense for us tactically and strategically, and we'll go ahead and do those smaller deals. 
Now in Africa, as you saw from Tom's presentation, is one of our fastest growing regions. Much like India, there's incredible need and demand, not only currently, but far into the future, for mobile service there. There are very low-cost handsets that are going to accelerate the adoption of 3G and 4G for people in those countries that really, really need it. And we've got kind of a pole position there. Certainly, in South Africa, we are the independent leader. In Nigeria, we're one of the top 2. In Ghana and Uganda, we are also the clear leader as independents, we feel. So we've got a really good strategic positioning in the countries that we think we need to be in there, and the trends are going to be very similar for the mid to long term in Africa, as they will be in India, where we think we can sustain double-digit growth rates."

We had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and margin performance across our global asset base. In fact, achieving record levels of new business commencements in the quarter. 
Once again, we achieved double-digit growth rates across all of our key metrics. During the period, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.55 per share, which, for 2016, we are targeting to grow over 20% from the prior year. 
Simultaneously, we continued to diligently integrate the Viom assets while focusing on driving organic growth and scaling our business worldwide. We also achieved our year-end leverage target about 3 months ahead of schedule. 
If you please turn to Slide 6. Let's take a look at our quarterly results. Total reported property revenue growth was nearly 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 21%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent wireless customer demand for our real estate throughout our global footprint. As I mentioned, organic commenced new business in the quarter was at record levels, about 23% higher than the Q3 of last year, split almost evenly between our U.S. and international businesses. 
Our U.S. Property segment revenue growth was about 3.6% factoring in a negative 1.7% impact from straight line revenue recognition. In addition, we booked about $0.5 million in decommissioning revenue this quarter, as compared to about $4 million recorded in Q3 of last year, resulting in an additional 50-basis-point negative impact to the growth rate. 
For the quarter, U.S. organic tenant billings growth was right in line with our expectations at 5.7%, reflecting a slight acceleration from Q2. Volume growth from colocations and amendments contributed about 4.4%, while pricing escalators contributed 2.8% and other run rate items contributed about 30 basis points. This was partially offset by churn of about 1.8%, of which the vast majority was associated with smaller, non-big 4 tenants. And as we disclosed last quarter, operational churn from the big 4 wireless carriers, what we call core networks in the U.S., which is defined as excluding activity on the former Clearwire network, has remained at about 30 basis points. Demand trends in the U.S. remained steady with carriers actively spending to augment the coverage and capacity of their 4G networks. 
Our international organic tenant billings growth was 13%, about 725 basis points higher than that of the U.S. While pricing escalators, driven by local CPI indices, contributed about 7% to that growth. Volumes from colocations and amendments were an even larger component at about 7.3%. Other run rate items contributed an additional 40 basis points. These all were partially offset by churn of about 1.6%. There was broad strength across our international property segment, with all 3 achieving double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates for the sixth quarter in a row. 
Organic tenant billings growth was almost 14% in Latin America, 12% in EMEA and over 11% in Asia. Our large multinational tenants in all these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to affordable, advanced handsets and begin to use significantly more data on those handsets. And these network investments appeared to be catalyzing incremental usage as the mobile experience gets better and better. For example, a carrier deploying a new greenfield 4G wireless broadband network in India has reported that its customers on average are already using well over 1 gig of data per day on that network. 
Along with trends like this, we expect the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model to continue to drive strong growth rates for our international portfolio. 
Further, day 1 revenue associated with the nearly 46,000 sites we've added since the third quarter of last year, which includes the Viom portfolio and about 2,100 new builds, contributed another 13% to our global tenant billings growth in Q3. Our new build program remains active, and we constructed over 350 towers globally this quarter. While this level of build activity was a bit lower than historical levels, we would expect this trend to reverse and build activity to pick up again in Q4. Our newly build sites average an NOI yield of over 10% this quarter on a consolidated basis. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Gross margin in the quarter was nearly 68%, which was negatively impacted by past-through revenue and the addition of nearly 46,000 new, lower initial margin sites. In the quarter, adjusting for the impact of past-through, we converted more than 90% of revenue to gross margin on sites that we've owned for more than a year. This strong conversion performance generated rising NOI yields across our portfolio. The average NOI yield on international sites built to require up to and including 2009, for example, rose to 32%, while the NOI yield on site dated between 2010 and 2013 improved to 13%. And even on sites added in 2014 and later, including Viom, NOI yields are rising, improving sequentially to about 10%.  
We think we have a tremendous opportunity to increase these NOI yields over time, particularly on our younger assets. 
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60.4% for the quarter, which was similarly impacted by pass-through in new sites. 
Cash, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, declined to 7.4% in the quarter and is expected to be under 8% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on Slide 8. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew over 17% to approximately $915 million, and consolidated AFFO grew by nearly 15%, driven by a combination of the solid adjusted EBITDA growth, I just mentioned, and seasonally lower-than-expected capital improvement CapEx. We do expect higher levels of capital improvement CapEx in fourth quarter due to the underspend this quarter. Consolidated AFFO per share growth in the quarter was almost 14%, resulting in year-to-date AFFO per share growth of over 12%. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. In late September, for example, we raised a total of $1 billion in unsecured senior notes with a weighted average maturity of over 7 years and historically low coupon rates for ATC. This transaction increased our average debt tenor to 5.3 years, increased our proportion of fixed-rate debt, which is now 76% overall, and even higher for U.S. funded debt at 80%. This transaction also allowed us to continue our long-held strategy of paying down our outstanding bank debt, which is primarily being used to support past acquisitions. This allows us to maximize our financial flexibility. 
In addition, as at the end of the third quarter, we achieved our goal of reducing our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA to 5x, 3 months ahead of schedule. Longer term, our target leverage remains between 3x and 5x. In addition, we continue to be well protected from the impacts of potentially rising interest rates. In fact, the 25-basis-point increase in LIBOR would result in just a $9 million in impact to AFFO on an annualized basis. 
Turning to Slide 10. Given our solid year-to-date performance, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast and Q4 growth expectations that are broadly consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full-year guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our outlook for property revenue by $50 million or about 0.9%, resulting in projected full-year growth of almost 22% or just over $1 billion. The increase is being driven by about a $25 million increase in past-through revenue, and a $5 million increase in straight line revenue on an FX-neutral basis, with remaining upside being driven by favorability from foreign exchange rate trends. Principally, that was generated in Q3. As in the past, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from pending transactions. 
Within our total revenue projections, we continue to expect U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.8% for the year, which reflects a steady demand environment. Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of over 13%, supported by strong trends in markets like Mexico and Ghana. We do expect slightly lower full-year tenant billings growth in India, as compared to our prior outlook, primarily due to carriers temporarily pausing some of their activities as they are waiting for the recent spectrum auction to conclude. However, we anticipate that organic tenant billings growth in Asia will increase to the mid-teens level during Q4. 
At a consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Day 1 revenue from sites added in the last year is expected to contribute to the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year for just about 15%. The growth outlined above has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of noncancelable tenant lease revenue, which now stands at around $32.5 billion, with an average remaining lease term of 5.7 years on a consolidated basis and about 6.4 years for our big 4 wireless customers in the U.S. 
We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, resulting in expected full-year growth of about 16% or roughly $500 million. The $25 million increase is being driven by a slight increase in net straight line, $15 million in FX favorability and roughly $10 million in expense management outperformance relative to our previous expectations for the property segment. This is being partially offset by a slightly lower expected contribution from our Services segment versus our prior outlook as a result of lower activity levels. 
Finally, we are raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $30 million or by over 1% at the midpoint, resulting an expected full-year growth of about 15% or about $320 million. This $30 million increase is being driven primarily by about a $20 million increase in cash EBITDA and roughly $10 million in lower net interest expense. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429.5 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.75 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of over 13%. 
Before I move on, I'd also note that factoring in our October month to date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of over $20 million for property revenue, $10 million for adjusted EBITDA and about $5 million of consolidate AFFO relative to the midpoints of our revised outlook. 
Turning to Slide 11. So far in 2016, we've demonstrated an ability to simultaneously deleverage the balance sheet, deploy meaningful capital to both our CapEx and acquisition programs and continue to fund a common stock dividend, which is expected to grow over 20% versus the prior year. Much of this is attributable to the significant internal cash flow generation capacity of our business, which is illustrated on this slide. As you can see, on a full-year basis, our projected cash from operations of around $2.5 billion allows us to fully fund over $900 million in expected common stock dividends and more than $700 million in anticipated total capital expenditures, while at the same time leaving us around $1 billion of additional discretionary investment capacity. 
As a result, we've been able to close significant transactions like Viom as well as other smaller deals for a total of around $2.1 billion year-to-date, and still reach our leverage target of 5x, a full quarter earlier. This leaves us with around $300 million in incremental capacity for the fourth quarter. This estimate doesn't include any of the anticipated proceeds from our European JV transaction, which we announced earlier today. 
Going forward, we would expect the internal cash flow generation capacity of our business to expand further as we continue to drive the high-margin conversion ratios on our organic revenue growth throughout our global footprint. 
In combination with being able to lever our incremental adjusted EBITDA growth, we would expect to have significant recurring investment capacity going forward. 
In addition, as we announced this morning, we've signed an agreement to form a strategic joint venture in Europe with PGGM. The formation of this joint venture, in addition to aligning us with a high-quality partner, will free up even more cash for us to deploy throughout our higher-growth markets. In addition, the JV has been established to explore, evaluate and potentially invest in new markets opportunities in Europe. 
At closing, we will contribute our joint assets in ATC Europe and PGGM will acquire a 49% interest in this entity. American Tower will retain operational control and day-to-day oversight of the business. 
Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year as our global business continues to generate solid growth across all of our key metrics. Our outlook now reflects consolidated AFFO per share growth of 13%, up from around 10% in our initial guidance provided in February. And we continue to expect dividend growth of over 20%. 
Looking forward, we believe we are poised to continue generating meaningful returns for investors for several key reasons: First, we are able to tap into the secular growth trend in mobile on a global scale, which we believe, when combined with our operational execution, will be the strong recurring growth across our existing asset base. Second, given our proven approach to capital allocation, a solid balance sheet with a capital structure within our targeted range and healthy free cash flow generation, we will have significant capacity to either invest in our business or return directly back to stockholders. And lastly, we believe we will continue to be able to generate strong growth in our common stock dividend. Putting this all together, we believe that we have built a dynamic, sustainable, long-term model for generating meaningful growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology. While the emphasis this morning is on the U.S., we expect similar trends to follow in other served markets. Mobile data usage continu",844,"Thanks, Tom. As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology. While the emphasis this morning is on the U.S., we expect similar trends to follow in other served markets. 
Mobile data usage continues to escalate rapidly. According to Cisco, the average U.S. smartphone now consumes more than 1.4 gigabits of data per month or a 1,700% increase from just 5 years ago. Video continues to power significant portion of that usage with advanced devices like the iPhone 7 and services like Go90, YouTube and Netflix. Consequently, total mobile data usage in the U.S. is now at more than 500 terabytes per month. Despite this, 4G penetration is estimated at only 60% to 65% in the U.S. today, indicating that there is still significant growth to come simply from the device upgrade cycle as subscribers acquire more advanced handsets. 
So to keep pace with the strain these trends create on mobile networks, the big 4 U.S. wireless carriers have consistently spent about $30 billion per year in CapEx since 2010, or roughly 15% of their total revenue on aggregate. And while the total spend has remained consistent, the per-gigabit cost for wireless carriers has dropped by more than 99% since 2005. This dramatic drop in expenses per gigabit has been supported through a combination of new spectrum, technology advancements and radio access network investments in these sites. We continue to believe that this level of capital intensity, which has been maintained over the last 10 years and has supported strong organic tenant billings growth for our business, is sustainable over the long term. 
In addition, over the past 5 years, the U.S. government has auctioned or otherwise made available close to 300 megahertz of new spectrum. We expect incremental spectrum assets, like AWS-3 and the WCS bands as well as the 700 megahertz spectrum that's been committed for the forthcoming public safety build-out, to be deployed over the next several years. 
As in the past, to fully capitalize on the availability of this spectrum, we anticipate that new antennas and radios will be placed on our towers, which should continue to help support healthy levels of growth for us in the U.S. 
We also expect the vast majority of these deployments in the near to medium term will take place on 4G macro tower networks, particularly given that the 5G standard isn't expected to be formalized until 2019. 
Meanwhile, technological advancements such as software-defined networks, self-optimizing networks and cloud RAN, among others, continue to focus primarily on the mobile core network. These advancements have enabled mobile carriers to achieve significant savings on their core network operations, bring up more resources for the radio access network that we support. 
At the same time, macro towers remain the most cost- and technologically-efficient solution for radio signal propagation in the vast majority of areas across our country. 
Looking forward, we expect that improved devices, greater 4G penetration, more and better applications and consumers' behavior will continue to drive mobile data usage at a 30% to 40% annual growth rate. In addition, the expanding role of the Internet of things, or IOT, will add further demands on mobile networks. In the near to midterm, this network burn will be shouldered by 4G technology. We expect that any near-term 5G deployments will be extremely short-range, essentially used for fixed wireless solutions. 
And furthermore, we expect that many early deployments of 5G will actually be indoors, where ATC is already a leading provider of indoor small cell networks today. Eventually, after the year 2020, we do think 5G technology will be widely applied for mobile applications, beginning first in dense urban areas, then spreading to suburban and rural areas predominately served by macro towers. This timeline also coincides with the clearing process of the 600 megahertz spectrum that's currently being auctioned. To the extent that this spectrum is in fact used for a broad 5G coverage build-out, we believe it could be a significant benefit for our tower business, given the large size and substantial way the antennas required for optimal use of low band spectrum like 600 megahertz. 
To the extent you'd like some additional information on the evolution of 4G and the potential impacts of 5G on our business, I'd encourage all of you to reference the presentation we have posted on the company and industry resources section of the American Tower Investor Relations website. 
So to summarize, we believe that the U.S. is still probably in the fifth or sixth inning of 4G deployments and that further 4G equipment installations will still be largely on macro towers. In 5G, while initially a primarily fixed wireless broadband technology to compete with the likes of cable, is likely to eventually be deployed for mobile services across our macro tower infrastructure that mainly serves suburban and rural areas where most Americans live and commute. As a result, we expect to generate solid growth in the U.S. market for years to come. 
So with that, operator, please open the call up for questions."

I'll pause on those 2 for a second because they're relatively high-band spectrum to be augmenting what's out there today. Ultimately, that means that in addition to -- on many sites, not necessarily all sites, but many sites, there'll be amendments, there'll also need to be eventually, a closer and more numerous array of transmission points to get the same signal quality from higher-band spectrum such as this versus what's out there again deployed today in the 700, 800 band. So we expect amendments and a mix of colocations going forward based on that new high-band spectrum being put into place. As to FirstNet's 700 megahertz spectrum, there is a schedule to be a winner of the competition with the government selecting that next month, in November, we are led to understand. But based on the schedule that's out there today, that would infer probably mid-2017 and beyond deployment of actual equipment. And depending on the winner of the architecture and the rollout plan, we'd be able to comment further in the next few months on any impacts to our business. But we'd expect them to be in a positive direction."

For the high-band spectrum simply because when you do carrier aggregation, you're also going to have to solve for the lowest common denominator of spectrum, meaning the shortest transmission range. And as you get into 1.9, 2.1, 2.5 types of spectrum, you're going to have to have more numerous cell sites, frankly, over time. So that's still going to have to happen both for a capacity need, which is more bits of throughput as we talked about going through that network, and also the higher signal-to-call -- signal-to-noise quality that you need because the spectrum doesn't travel as robustly. And secondly, you've got video, which requires much more powerful signal to be usable. So we still think there's, again, 3 or 4 good, solid innings, if not more, of 4G capacity and edge coverage deployment in front of us in the United States. The amendments and the colocations, Tom, you can give the latest number on that."

And I would expect that typical type of trend to occur over the next 6 to 12 months. We'll see what kind of impacts the -- some of the spectrum being deployed that Jim mentioned before. 
And with regards to India, we do expect a heightened activity in Q4. If you take a look at over the last 6 to 8 quarters in Asia, Tim, we've been in kind of that 10% to 13% kind of growth range on an organic kind of billings basis. And my sense is that's probably a fair range looking forward in that market. With the $10 billion that the carriers just spend on spectrum in the market, we know that they're going to want to get that deployed. And so we see 4G activity going on in the market. So a lot of good things are happening in India, but I don't think the mid-teens type of the rate that we're going to see in Q4 is something that we'll see long term. I think it will revert back to some of the more traditional kind of 10% to 12% kind of growth rates."

And I think to support those kind of 10% to 12% growth rates in a market like India, if you look at some of the real fundamentals there, first of all, the industry structure is rationalizing and becoming sustainable for long-term investment, right? So you're going to have probably half a dozen, at least, well-financed, scaled operators that can actually effectively and profitably deploy 4G across that vast country. So you've got an industry structure that's rationalizing. 
Secondly, spectrum and narrow bands and also very -- sort of fractionalized deployment of spectrum has been a limiting factor on mobile data deployment in India. That's been essentially cleaned up, if you will, or get rationalized with this latest auction and some of the smaller players either exiting, et cetera, giving those bigger players not only the financial capacity to do 4G, but now the spectrum position to do it effectively as well. 
So as a platform, you've got the industry and the spectrum in place to do it. And you've got a pattern of investments already by the carriers there that look a lot like those in the U.S. They're spending 15% to 20% of their revenue on capital expenditures similar to as of U.S. did during its growth phase. There's $4.5 billion to $5 billion a year being spent in India by these carriers now. And they're -- they've got so much work to do because far below 25% of the subscribers have 3G or 4G. 75% to 85% of people in India are still literally on 2G, texting and talking on their phones. There's incredible opportunity there. And then on top of everything else, you've got this catalyst of Reliance Jio out there sort of leading the market. So this low double-digit growth rate, as Tom suggested, we think can be sustained for quite some time."

I think it was the trailing 30 days or the consensus average forecast. And given, for instance, in the real, how big the delta is between your guidance and the spot rate. I was wondering if you kind of inform where that number comes from. And then lastly, just as a housekeeping item, I think you said something about maintenance CapEx being deferred in the quarter.

And we'll look to bring that cash back and reinvest it, as we talked about it, in some other high-growth opportunities. We'll have additional capacity, as I also mentioned, because we would achieve our target leverage kind of 90 days before we had thought. So that will leave us with roughly $300 million capacity, and then we'll have this additional EUR 250 million. So we feel good about how we're ending the year, where we are from the balance sheet perspective. 
On the FX side, you're right. As I've always kind of said, we know we're going to be wrong in terms of how we look at FX, but we're consistent. And so the forecast that we've used for the balance of the year is exactly as you laid out. It's the more conservative of what's the year-end forecast would be that we find on, that we see the banks put out on Bloomberg over the last 90 days of an average spot rate. And so we've been very consistent with that. So the upside that we have included now in our outlook really includes the FX benefits that we generated versus our previous outlook in Q3. And so there are very little incremental Q4 FX upside in our outlook. So as I said, we just want to be very consistent and very transparent in terms of outlook at FX. It's well documented in our disclosures. And that's why then, even in the remarks that I made, we talked about some of the additional upside, Dave, that we might have relative to the rates continuing as they are, spot rates for the balance of the year, and now with that $20 million, I think, upside of revenue, which is principally coming from the real. You're right. It's significantly -- the spot is significantly below where the forecasted rate is. And it has been over a year, and that has provided us less headwinds, if you will, for the year and perhaps some upside for Q4. And then the -- you had so many questions, Dave. What was the last one?"

But as I'm sure you can appreciate investors are debating if that's a structural change or if that is something that's simply timing and part of that is around small cells. And while I appreciate that small cells are more expensive to build and it's more efficient to deploy a macro, the carries to some degree are capital constrained. And if they do need to be building out small cells, and something else has to go in terms of where they're making the investment, one could argue that it seems to be cell-splitting.

And the reality of how regional real estate managers and the mobile operators or regional network managers operate, is that they get a budget every year. And they're going to use that budget, whether it's $5 million or $10 million or $50 million for their region for that period, they're going to use that budget in the most efficient way they can determine to solve the network issues that they have in front of them. And we've got pretty close experience with a lot of these folks. And there are a list of things to do seems to always exceed the budget they have awarded to them for that year. So there's always network needs to increase capacity, improve coverage, limit their own churn off, to meet growing demand, et cetera. And the list exceeds the budget. So the shakeout of amendments versus colos, it's really what solves the most problems in that given year. And there's always more amendments and more colos that they can actually do. When it comes to small cells, you just indicated that's probably the least efficient, especially outdoor small cells, the least efficient option of these individuals to spend their budget. And so they spend that budget in the places only and at the times only on small cells as we -- as our experience, when they have to do so. And so our experience on the total spend going to a macro site-type deployments versus small cell-type deployments, we've said in the past is about 5% of what we can see right now going to small cells and perhaps, over the next 5 years, that can go as high as 10% of the total, with the total itself growing because of the percentage of revenue and revenue growing. So we really don't see wholesale shifts in the spending pattern or the habits of the people that we deal with in the field on the front line of the mobile operators. And hopefully that addresses your question."

First of all, it really is an initiative that achieves objectives in all 3 of our sort of strategic pillars that we had in place for the last 15 years since I've been CEO here. The first of those pillars is to put ourselves in a situation where we can achieve strategic positioning in a leadership rank of independent tower companies or mobile infrastructure companies in all the most populous regions of the world, all right? And we have that in the U.S. We have that in Latin America. We have that in India. We have that in Africa. And in Europe, we'd like to pursue other avenues to achieve that as long as they meet our investment criteria. So for strategic positioning, PGGM is an excellent partner for us in the region to give us a wider window for potential expansion into the market, if we -- again if and only if we can meet our ATC investment criteria, which as you know, is pretty strict. The second of our strategic pillars is to be -- in our aspiration, the top execution, experience and operator in this space in the world, right? I think PGGM has stepped up and validated with us that we are that operating partner of choice and that we can then team up with others with regional experience or regional positioning to try to achieve that growth aspiration. And thirdly, it's therapeutic to our balance sheet. We've always wanted a strong balance sheet along the way over the last 15 years. We've maintained investment-grade for many, many years, in spite of growing the business very dramatically, as you've seen us do. And we are going to get proceeds from this that will both help our leverage position in the short term and allow us to redeploy it into newer growth opportunities in the mid to long term. So I think that, really, this arrangement hits all 3 of our strategic pillars: strategic positioning, validates our operational expertise and is conductive to our balance sheet strategy."

As far as our broadcast business, it's mid-single-digit percent of our revenue, a really solid piece of our business, which has very long-term contracts, as you know, in the TV and radio space. And with the incentive auctions going on now, there are going to be a few moving parts that we think we're in a really excellent position to sort of address and take advantage of. 
You may recall, 3 or 4 years ago, we acquired Richland Towers, which was, I guess, the second largest independent in the space. And so we have a really solid position to help the broadcasters that either retain or divest some of their spectrum to stay on air, right? So they're going to have to have sites that are both simultaneously transmitting in the market while equipment is being taken down or put up. So we will have plenty of sites for them to move to in the process. And we'll be able to be, we think, the real estate provider of choice as this TV station shuffle of a spectrum and channels goes through. 
So we think it's going to be a nice solid growth business, it's going to contribute to our U.S. operations for many years here. 
As far as the small deals that we're doing, it's the same disciplined investment process that we've had in place for years and years. We've got these very highly qualified teams, I would describe them as, across all the continents globally, that are continuing to always look for opportunities for us to invest and meet our criteria of those investments and get AFFO-accretive deals for us. And sometimes, those are big, like in Viom or Verizon or GDP and sometimes those are modest size, like in South Africa, we are acquiring Eaton Towers, adding about 300 sites to our portfolio. It makes a ton of sense for us tactically and strategically, and we'll go ahead and do those smaller deals. 
Now in Africa, as you saw from Tom's presentation, is one of our fastest growing regions. Much like India, there's incredible need and demand, not only currently, but far into the future, for mobile service there. There are very low-cost handsets that are going to accelerate the adoption of 3G and 4G for people in those countries that really, really need it. And we've got kind of a pole position there. Certainly, in South Africa, we are the independent leader. In Nigeria, we're one of the top 2. In Ghana and Uganda, we are also the clear leader as independents, we feel. So we've got a really good strategic positioning in the countries that we think we need to be in there, and the trends are going to be very similar for the mid to long term in Africa, as they will be in India, where we think we can sustain double-digit growth rates."

So the business itself, in Germany, as you know, is not a significant business for us overall from a consolidated perspective. So we don't have significant amounts of euros being generated. We have been able to candidly pull out a fair amount of cash from the business over the last 3 or 4 years since we've owned it. But we're hopeful that to the extent that this platform proves successful, and as Jim said, we have deals over there that make sense for us that we would be able to increase our exposure into the marketplace. And relative to multiples and things like that, we're really under NDA to be able to disclose any of those. I think we feel really good about the values that have been ascribed to this business. And I think we have, as Jim said, just a really solid platform to be able to look at other opportunities therapeutic to the balance -- all of the things that you've mentioned in terms of supporting our strategic goals in the business, we're really excited about this opportunity."

And relative to the buyback, I think, as Jim mentioned, when we come back in February and talk about our goals and plans for 2017, we can get a little bit more specific, and we'll have 3 or 4 months of more knowledge in terms of just what the activity might look like for the year. We expect to be at that 5x or below. Clearly, with this kind of cash that we're going to be getting from the JV and the additional capacity that we have. So we feel really good in terms of the ability to hit our targets that we laid out at beginning of the year. I think it positions us well for next year."
