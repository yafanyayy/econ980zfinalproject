19609,321967546,926535,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. Charter Spectrum our advanced and high value products, which continues to attract consumers. Our residential and commercial customer growth continues to accelerate and Charter remains the fastest growing cable company in the United States.",1468,"Thanks, Stefan. Charter Spectrum our advanced and high value products, which continues to attract consumers. Our residential and commercial customer growth continues to accelerate and Charter remains the fastest growing cable company in the United States. By providing highly competitive products at attractive price points and simple packages with quality service, we will continue to add customer relationships inside both Charter's legacy footprint and new Charter's broader footprint. We'll do that by applying the same customer-friendly operating strategy that the Time Warner Cable and Bright House assets as we migrate those footprints to our Spectrum product pricing packaging and customer-friendly operating practices. 
We finished 2015 with 6.7 million residential and small business customers. For the full year, that base of customers grew by 6% with presidential customer growth growing by 5% and SMB growing by 17%. We grew our total video customer base by 11,000 relationships in 2015 compared to a loss of 78,000 last year. This is the first time in over a decade that Charter has added video customers over any 12-month period. 
Driving that growth is an improved video offering with better pictures, more HD than satellite, video-on-demand and interactive guide functionality on every TV outlet, combined with high-quality in-source and U.S.-based customer service, all in an easy-to-understand pricing and packaging structure, which makes our products competitive well beyond the point of sale. 
We also continue to grow our Internet business in 2015. We added nearly 450,000 Residential Internet customers, up 9% compared to last year. Our low-cost, high-speed Internet offering provides great value to consumers whether they purchase inside one of our bundles or on a stand-alone basis. Nearly 1/3 of our total residential customers, close to 2 million customers, are now nonvideo customers and that grew by about 18% year-over-year. As of the end of the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of our Residential Internet customers subscribe to Internet service that provided speeds of 60 megabits or more. 
We continue to be an industry leader in Internet customer growth by offering high speeds at low-price points with no data caps, no usage based billing, no [indiscernible] fees, and that's been our operating practice for the last 4 years and we plan to continue that. 
In commercial, we also continue to drive accelerating customer growth. After we separated our small business and enterprise segments early last year, we launched new pricing and packaging to both marketplaces and are seeing the results we expected. SMB PSU growth accelerated by 30% in 2015 and 47% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In time, the accelerating commercial unit growth will drive faster revenue growth at it has in residential. Business services remains an area of significant long-term opportunity for Charter and we've demonstrated that we can grow business customers faster with a highly competitive operating strategy. 
For the full year, we grew our revenue by 7.1%. Excluding amortizing, revenue grew by 7.7%, all while taking meaningful lower price increases than in 2014. Our EBITDA growth, excluding transition costs, grew by 8.5% and continue to exceed our revenue growth. That EBITDA growth, combined with declining capital intensity, is driving free cash flow conversion. We generated approximately $550 million of free cash flow in 2015, up from approximately $170 million last year. Excluding M&A-related cost, our free cash flow was even higher, over $1 billion, up $700 million compared to 2014 on the same basis. So as we continue to grow our EBITDA and our capital intensity declines, Charter is becoming a meaningful generator of free cash. 
In 2016, we have 3 key priorities, executing on our core customer growth strategy in both residential and commercial; making the Spectrum product set even better; and finally, closing and integrating Time Warner Cable and Bright House. 
Starting with our core customer growth are strategic, we remain focused on growing our business by increasing long-lasting customer relationships rather than through just price increases. We grow loyal customer relationships by going to market with a simple high-quality products Charter Spectrum, which we offer at very affordable prices and those prices will essentially remain flat in 2016. 
Over the past 4 years, we've hired over 7,000 people to help us support our products with customer service provided by our own people as opposed to contract labor offshore. In the new company, we'll need to hire about 20,000 more people to do the same proportionally. As we train and manage our own employees, we're creating a skilled labor force executing higher-quality service transactions with our customers when we sell and provision, install and some billing question or handle repairs. Today, nearly 90% of our customer calls are handled onshore and in-house and 95% of our service truck rolls are in-house. Those higher-quality customer interactions are reducing service transactions, reducing churn and creating longer relationships supporting greater customer growth and reducing our operating costs. 
We're also making Spectrum products even better. Through the course of 2016, we're rolling out our new cloud-based Spectrum Guide. Our initial Spectrum Guide launches are working and scaling well with positive customer response. Spectrum Guide's more intuitive and feature-rich user interface improves both video search and discovery, fully enables our on-demand offering and allows us to include Internet video in the guide which enhances the value of our service. And because the guide is cloud-based and will work across nearly all of our 10 million set-top boxes, we can launch and refresh the guide without purchasing or installing new set-top boxes.  
By avoiding deployment of new boxes, Spectrum Guide minimizes customers disruption and accelerates the time to put a modern UI on every outlet. 
It turns every TV into a connected smart TV and allow us to integrate third-party video services, including over-the-top providers like YouTube, Netflix, Google and Amazon prime, giving customers the ability to search and view all the content they're interested in without changing consumer owned hardware or devices. We're also designing Spectrum Guide for dynamic ad insertion as a way to enhance targeting, enable programmers to reduce ad loads with less revenue risk. 
Over the course of 2016, we'll also extend our on-demand library with thousands of additional titles and we'll continue to improve our capabilities on additional devices with further live on-demand downloadable content to-go. And in the Internet, we're beginning to roll out our Spectrum WiFi, which provides unlimited Internet access to residential customers when they're outside the home. 
All these product improvements enhancements will be offered to Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers, so they will fully benefit from the collective and product development of these 3 companies. 
Turning to our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, we've made good progress in working with the regulators and other stakeholders, financing the transactions and planning the integration. We've met the closing conditions for franchise approvals. And at the federal level, we continue to work closely with the FCC and DOJ to make sure they have the information they need and we remain hopeful that the process can be completed in March. 
In January, we received approval for our transactions from the New York State Public Service Commission and at the state level, we're still waiting on New Jersey, Hawaii and California. We will continue to work with state authorities to achieve a faster time line as we have 90,000 employees waiting to become part of the new company and we don't want to delay the significant consumer benefits that our transactions deliver. 
From a balance sheet employee and operational perspective, we're ready to close. In early November, we completed the process of placing our acquisition financing in the debt markets and have additional financing commitments if needed. We're making good progress on integration plans, focusing on organizational structure and systems, all digital new pricing and packaging, Spectrum Guide and roadblocks rollouts. 
Our integration planning and investments, including insourcing of various IT product and service platforms will allow us to project uniform pricing, packaging and services across a national footprint which will accelerate the integration of the 3 companies. Those cloud infrastructure investments include a billing isolation layer, a new provisioning architecture and a unified bill agnostic customer service platform in call centers and in the field. These investments will help to simplify product, standardize service interactions in a consistent way without the time, cost and risk of migrating multiple third-party platforms. 
These transactions brings significant benefit to all of our stakeholders. For consumers, these transactions will mean better products at better prices with high-quality service. And a new company will be a significant contributor to the continued development of our national broadband infrastructure by bringing faster Internet speeds to more homes in more places with proconsumer practices. We look forward to closing shortly so that we can produce the transaction benefits that the communities we serve. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,321967546,926535,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I mentioned in our last call that we migrated our customer reporting methodology to match the approach used by our peers and advance the closing and do a report last quarter in this quarter. As the results we issued today in our press release",1476,"Thanks, Tom. I mentioned in our last call that we migrated our customer reporting methodology to match the approach used by our peers and advance the closing and do a report last quarter in this quarter. As the results we issued today in our press release and trending schedule, present a residential customer results using the doors methodology, our SMB video customers are now based on relationships instead of EBUs and we separately report enterprise PSUs to reflect our recent organizational changes. 
Our P&L presentation similarly separates SMB revenue from enterprise revenue. And obviously, our new presentation approach does not impact our overall financial results. And the customer PSU revenue and adjusted EBITDA trends that you see under the new methodology used today are very similar to the trends that you would see under the previous methodology. In fact, on Pages 2 and 4 of today's trending schedule, we provided results under the prior presentation methodology as well to provide a transparent transition. 
So starting with Slide 8 in today's presentation. During the fourth quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 191,000 versus 151,000 last year. And in video, we added 29,000 residential customers versus a loss of 3,000 last year. 
In Residential Internet, we added 115,000 customers and we grew residential voice customers by 47,000. 
Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 294,000 or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 2.3%, driven by a larger triple play base and step-ups, loss rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet growth. 
As Slide 10 shows our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 7.2% compared to 8.3% last year, as we had lower rate increases in 2015. 
In commercial, we added 28,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year. And that improvement is being driven by a greater focus on customer types following the separation of our SMB and enterprise groups, the web launch of new pricing and packaging to the SMB marketplace in early 2015. 
Total commercial revenue grew by approximately 12% continues to reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure that we saw in residential when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in the middle of 2012. 
Our advertising revenue was down about 19% year-over-year, driven by a $16 million decline in political in the fourth quarter given last year's election cycle. In total, our fourth quarter revenue was up by 6.4% year-over-year, 7.6%, excluding advertising. And for the full year, as Tom mentioned, we grew our revenue by 7.1% and 7.7%, excluding advertising. 
In dollar terms, revenue grew by nearly $650 million. If you exclude advertising, 2015 revenue grew by $678 million, more than the 650 -- $645 million in 2014. So we're pleased with the continued increase in revenue, especially when you consider that we took more modest rate increases than in 2014 and most of our 2015 revenue growth came from customer relationship growth. 
Turning to fourth quarter operating expense and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. Total operating expense grew by $89 million or 5.9% year-over-year with transition OpEx accounting for $22 million of our total OpEx this Quarter. These type of cost will eventually become integration cost postclosing. 
Excluding transition, total expenses grew by 5.3%. And on a full year basis, again, excluding transition, our expense base grew by $372 million year-over-year, that compares to $433 million in 2014. So if you step back, we're more burning more dollars of revenue with less dollars of expense growth. 
Back to fourth quarter expenses. Programming expenses grew by $49 million accounting for about half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 7.9% increase in fourth quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our peers and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers. 
Cost-to-service customers, which includes field operations, customer care and network operating costs was flat year-over-year despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.6%. We continue to get more efficient with lower service transaction volumes. 
Other costs grew by $28 million or about 15% year-over-year, and that's driven by some additional corporate administrative labor expense, which includes the insourcing of IT and software development resources and enterprise, as well as property taxes on previous CapEx and higher casualty claims due to more insource employee base. 
Excluding transition-related expenses, the fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% year-over-year, which exceeds our revenue growth. Keep in mind that fourth quarter 2014 also benefited from political advertising. 
Moving to Slide 13. Fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $548 million with $49 million related to M&A transactions spend for the activities Tom covered. This platform investments began with the Comcast transactions and have provided us a head start to provide a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers postclosing. Excluding all-digital and transition CapEx in both periods, the fourth quarter CapEx was up by just over $24 million or 5%. That's driven primarily by investments in product development and timing. 
For the full year 2015 and when excluding transition CapEx, our CapEx totaled $1.725 billion as expected. In 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and acquisitions, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline year-over-year for Charter on a stand-alone basis. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow totaled $80 million, just below last year's level and the modest decline was driven by the impact of transition OpEx, CapEx and a largest and the most obvious one is being the interest related to our acquisition financing. For the full year, our reported free cash flow grew to approximately $550 million, up from $170 million last year with adjusted EBITDA up, CapEx down, a positive working capital contribution, offset by transaction and transition cost. As Tom mentioned, excluding the impact of our transactions specifically in -- for the full year, $72 million to operating expense, $115 million of CapEx, $260 million of cash interest and $70 million of transaction costs and other expenses, our 2015 full year free cash flow adjusted for the transaction spend was over $1 billion and over $9 per share. 
At of December 31, our leverage ratio was 4.1x on an LTM basis. So we've reached the low end of our leverage range of 4 to 4.5x. In November, we issued $2.5 million of high-yield notes to help finance our proposed transaction with TWC. And that placement, combined with the $19.3 billion of financings that we completed in July and August, totals to $21.8 billion of debt that we have in escrow on the balance sheet to finance our transactions. 
So we've fully placed all the financing for our transactions in the debt markets assuming that TWC shareholders are left $100 cash option. At close, we still expect to be levered at about 4.5x or lower. And that 4.5x leverage is based on the new Charter's 2015 estimated adjusted EBITDA and also includes $500 million of year 1 synergies. 
Similar to Charter today, new Charter will be in a position to mechanically delever through adjusted EBITDA and cash flow growth. Our target leverage for new Charter will remain 4 to 4.5x, but we will look to manage our leverage to the lower end of that range and we're committed to maintaining an investment-grade index rating at a secured level with first lien leverage under 3.5x. To the extent that the $115 cash election were chosen by TWC shareholders, we also have a $4.3 billion high yield bridge in place to cover our needs. 
I should mention this morning, we launched $1.5 billion, 144A offering and proceeds of which we intend to retain until the TWC shareholder election in closing. 
Turning to our tax assets on Slide 15. At the end of the day, we had $8 billion of tax basis in our assets and $11.3 billion in NOLs, for a total of $19.3 billion in tax assets, about $700 million more than we had at the end of 2014. The year-over-year increase in the total tax assets was primarily driven by our previously disclosed partnership liquidation that we executed in the third quarter. 
Some of our tax base has also moved over to the NOL buckets in the course of 2015 given regular depreciation and amortization, utilization of bonus depreciation, and accelerated tax benefits related to new tangible property regulations. The net present value of those tax assets are worth well over $3 billion today. With the combined tax assets, new Charter will be worth over $6 billion in NPV, the reasons we've highlighted previously. We don't expect new Charter to be a significant cash tax payer until 2018. And even then, at a significantly reduced cash tax rate for several years.

So if you take a step at a high level. 2015 had very little in the way of price increases as well. So 2016 is not going to be that dramatic. The reality is if you're growing the residential customer base at 5% plus, there's not much that you you need to be doing on the rate side and you can be extremely competitive and grow and provide value to consumers. So 2016, we have more momentum in the marketplace than we did coming into 2015 and there's even less need than in the past to have to take rate increases. You also have SMB and enterprise, which right now, you've seen a decelerating trend on revenue growth and an accelerating trend on PSU growth. And we expect over time SMB and enterprise could perform a lot like residential did in the May 2012, 2013 time frame. And our goal is to reaccelerate the growth for revenue, not just customers and PSUs on that side as well. Clearly, we're in a political advertising year as well and a sometimes that's unclear how much of that is going to flow to you. But similar to what we've done in prior years, always isolate that political advertising, so people have clarity around it so that they can isolate the growth rates in the good and in the bad that. So we'll be doing that throughout the course of this year as well. So I don't think that to put it bluntly, I don't think that's a lower amount of rate increase really has a dramatic impact to because of our improved ability to grow."

The transition process of integrating the other companies and building a game plan to roll it out is going to take longer. And so we will not, assuming we close some time in the near future on those companies, we're not going to get them completely rolled out this fiscal year. But I think we can begin the process by the end of this year. The big issue interestingly, we've gotten all the bugs that we think could exist out of this system and it works very well. The choice before us will be, do we roll it out on every outlet and a sort of early out incrementally to just new customers and then begin to make it optional to existing customers. And the tension there is that there's a some people that are just confused by new user interfaces and you have to manage that process and the customer education, as well as the desire to get a highly functional UI out in front of everyone simultaneously. So we're still wrestling with the right rollout strategy. But operationally, it works very well, and it's capable of being fully deployed."

A lot of people focus on CP as being one of the big drivers and it is primarily because it's the easiest to model. So the drivers around that are -- once you've gone all-digital, you need less CPE per transaction. So just by growing all-digital on a go-forward basis, you require less CPE for every gross add. The second element is that we're buying boxes at dramatically lower prices, well over 50% reduction from we were buying that. And that's being driven by the introduction of roadblocks that even path to getting roadblocks produce those types of prices for us. And by extending the license CPE with Spectrum Guide that obviously has big impact on capital intensity. The pieces that are, in some respect, even more material but harder to model include that the business is increasingly becoming more cloud-based. And by developing and putting platforms in the cloud as opposed to the local level, you can video-on-demand as just one type of example. You can get better scale on any cable system by doing that and become a more efficient from a capital perspective. Another area that's also harder to model is that today, when you take Charter and Bright House, 3 companies is doing their own development and the standing up platforms data centers or product development or IT platforms and that gets to be done in a single instance as opposed to 3 different times. So there's a benefit to the transaction of putting these 3 companies together and being able to develop faster and at a cheaper cost capacity or per dollar of revenue. And the final one, I think, this is the one that's probably the most misunderstood, I think you're referencing the proxy statement that we had the CapEx forecast it's simply when you have higher revenue growth and you should take a look at our results, when you have higher revenue growth, you have a higher dollar value of revenue per passing in an environment where a good portion of your capital expenditure is fixed capital spend. And so simply by growing revenue faster, you can drop your capital intensity by having a better utilization and fixed set of assets and fixed capital cost. So that's the piece that I think that's the most misunderstood is on those proxy statements, which I'm not sitting here and reiterating today, although we were when we put them together, the reality is that of those CapEx dollars decreasing, the capital intensity was a declining significantly for all their recent I mentioned but a big driver of that is simply being able to drive higher revenue growth on a fixed set of assets."

We were going to invest more in service and we were going to invest more in every a transaction by putting more equipment and gear into the home, and that's how we were going to make money, which is a little bit counterintuitive until you think about by lowering the pricing on every single one of your product, you have the opportunity to sell more over time and get more revenue per household and get more efficient for all the reasons that we talked about. So we told people at the time that success would be defined by an accelerating customer relationship growth, better sell into multiple products in the household, PSU growth as a result and then several quarters on we'd see an acceleration of the revenue growth, which would be stunted short term by putting in the high-value pricing and packaging. And then over time, you'd see EBITDA growth and reduction at capital intensity, all of which you see in Charter and it does provide the baseline model. The difference is being going forward, we think we can do it faster because of the status of where TWC and Bright House are already at in terms of the quality of the plant and some improvements even in the past year. And the fact that we'll have transaction benefits as a result that can be reinvested into the business along the way to being better products, festered so that TWC and Bright House customers."

Almost all of our customer -- vast majority of our customers subscribe to us and over-the-top services. And we want our customers to be fully satisfied in their video experience and have that to be a seamless experience possible. And therefore, given the movement to on-demand programming and the volume -- the sheer volume of products available, you need to be able to search and find and discover products in a much more efficient way than people have historically stumbled on in television. And that's why we're building the UI, we're building -- and it's fully capable of doing cross-platform search. There are business issues rather that we're through with parties, but it's what customers deserve. With regard to gross adds and the share where they're coming from, I'm not sure whether they're -- the economic or the macroeconomic situation has changed at all because growth rates in the country and for all MVPDs. We think that in our -- where we operate, our video share is about 50%. And so we think that we have a tremendous upside to grow our own business with the quality of a video services that we can build in provide and with the service infrastructure we've built around that. I do think at as we talk about the macro issues previously and the pressures on video, most of which I think are economic, the cost have been high. It does look like cost have been moderated a little bit on the margin and that's partially because over-the-top is affecting the value of content in a good way from our perspective. And so, and I'm not -- we'll have to look at the macro trends, but in terms of what our growth opportunities are, our biggest growth opportunity is to take a video share from existing providers estimated we have a better products and services."

Charter Spectrum, our advanced and high value product suite, continues to attract consumers. Our residential and commercial customer growth continues to accelerate and Charter remains the fastest growing cable company in the United States.",1469,"Thanks, Stefan. Charter Spectrum, our advanced and high value product suite, continues to attract consumers. Our residential and commercial customer growth continues to accelerate and Charter remains the fastest growing cable company in the United States. By providing highly competitive products at attractive price points and simple packages with quality service, we will continue to add customer relationships inside both Charter's legacy footprint and new Charter's broader footprint. We'll do that by applying the same customer-friendly operating strategy that Time Warner Cable and Bright House assets as we migrate those footprints to our Spectrum product pricing packaging and customer-friendly operating practices. 
We finished 2015 with 6.7 million residential and small business customers. For the full year, that base customers grew by 6%, residential customer growth -- growing by 5% and SMB growing by 17%. We grew our total video customer base by 11,000 relationships in 2015 compared to a loss of 78,000 last year. This is the first time in over a decade that Charter has added video customers over any 12-month period. 
Driving that growth is an improved video offering with better pictures, more HD than satellite, video-on-demand and interactive guide functionality on every TV outlet, combined with high-quality, insourced and U.S.-based customer service, all in an easy-to-understand pricing and packaging structure, which makes our products competitive well beyond the point of sale. 
We also continued to grow our Internet business in 2015. We added nearly 450,000 Residential Internet customers, up 9% compared to last year. Our low-cost, high-speed Internet offering provides great value to consumers whether they purchase inside one of our bundles or on a stand-alone basis. Nearly 1/3 of our total residential customers, close to 2 million customers, are now non-video customers and that grew by about 18% year-over-year. As of the end of the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of our Residential Internet customers subscribe to Internet service that provided speeds of 60 megabits or more. 
We continue to be an industry leader in Internet customer growth by offering high speeds at low price points with no data caps, no usage based billing, no modem rental fees, and that's been our operating practice for the last 4 years and we plan to continue that. 
In commercial, we also continue to drive accelerating customer growth. After we separated our small business and enterprise segments early last year, we launched new pricing and packaging to both marketplaces and are seeing the results we expected. SMB PSU growth accelerated by 30% in 2015 and 47% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In time, that accelerating commercial unit growth will drive faster revenue growth as it has in residential. Business services remains an area of significant long-term opportunity for Charter and we've demonstrated that we can grow business customers faster with our highly competitive operating strategy. 
For the full year, we grew our revenue by 7.1%. Excluding advertising, revenue grew by 7.7%, all while taking meaningful lower price increases than in 2014. Our EBITDA growth, excluding transition costs, grew by 8.5% and continued to exceed our revenue growth. That EBITDA growth, combined with declining capital intensity, is driving greater free cash flow conversion. We generated approximately $550 million of free cash flow in 2015, up from approximately $170 million last year. Excluding M&A-related cost, our free cash flow was even higher, over $1 billion, up $700 million compared to 2014 on the same basis. So as we continue to grow our EBITDA and our capital intensity declines, Charter is becoming a meaningful generator of free cash.
In 2016, we have 3 key priorities, executing on our core customer growth strategy in both residential and commercial; making the Spectrum product set even better; and finally, closing and integrating Time Warner Cable and Bright House.
Starting with our core customer growth strategy, we remain focused on growing our business by increasing long-lasting customer relationships rather than through just price increases. We grow loyal customer relationships by going to market with simple high-quality products Charter Spectrum, which we offer at very affordable prices and those prices will essentially remain flat in 2016.
Over the past 4 years, we've hired over 7,000 people to help us support our products with customer service provided by our own people as opposed to contract labor offshore. In the new company, we'll need to hire about 20,000 more people to do the same proportionally. As we train and manage our own employees, we're creating a skilled labor force that is executing higher-quality service transactions with our customers when we sell and provision, install and some billing questions or handle repairs. Today, nearly 90% of our customer calls are handled onshore and in-house and 95% of our service truck rolls are in-house. Those higher-quality customer interactions are reducing service transactions, reducing churn and creating longer customer relationships supporting greater customer growth and reducing our operating cost.
We're also making Spectrum products even better. Through the course of 2016, we're rolling out our new cloud-based Spectrum Guide. Our initial Spectrum Guide launches are working and scaling well with positive customer response. Spectrum Guide's more intuitive and feature-rich user interface improves both video search and discovery, fully enables our on-demand offering and allows us to include Internet video in the guide, which enhances the value of our service. And because the guide is cloud-based and will work across nearly all of our 10 million set-top boxes, we can launch and refresh the guide without purchasing or installing new set-top boxes.  
By avoiding deployment of new boxes, Spectrum Guide minimizes customers disruption and accelerates the time to put a modern UI on every outlet. 
It turns every TV into a connected smart TV and allows us to integrate third-party video services, including over-the-top providers like YouTube, Netflix, Google and Amazon prime, giving customers the ability to search and view all the content they're interested in without changing consumer-owned hardware or devices. We're also designing Spectrum Guide for dynamic ad insertion as a way to enhance targeting and enable programmers to reduce ad loads with less revenue risk. 
Over the course of 2016, we'll also extend our on-demand library with thousands of additional titles and we'll continue to improve our capabilities on additional devices with further live on-demand downloadable content to-go. And in the Internet, we're beginning to roll out our Spectrum WiFi, which provides unlimited Internet access to residential customers when they're outside the home. 
All these product improvements enhancements will be offered to Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers, so they will fully benefit from the collective and product development of these 3 companies. 
Turning to our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, we've made good progress in working with the regulators and other stakeholders, financing the transactions and planning the integration. We've met the closing conditions for franchise approvals. And at the federal level, we continue to work closely with the FCC and DOJ to make sure they have the information they need and we remain hopeful that the process can be completed in March. 
In January, we received approval for our transactions from the New York State Public Service Commission and at the state level, we're still waiting on New Jersey, Hawaii and California. We will continue to work with state authorities to achieve a faster time line as we have 90,000 employees waiting to become part of the new company and we don't want to delay the significant consumer benefits that our transactions deliver.
From a balance sheet employee and operational perspective, we're ready to close. In early November, we completed the process of placing our acquisition financing in the debt markets and have additional financing commitments if needed. We're making good progress on integration plans, focusing on organizational structure and systems, all digital new pricing and packaging, Spectrum Guide and Worldbox rollouts. 
Our integration planning and investments, including insourcing of various IT product and service platforms will allow us to project uniform pricing, packaging and services across a national footprint, which will accelerate the integration of the 3 companies. Those cloud infrastructure investments include a billing isolation layer, a new provisioning architecture and a unified biller-agnostic customer service platform in call centers and in the field. These investments will help to simplify product, standardize service interactions in a consistent way without the time, cost and risk of migrating multiple third-party platforms. 
These transactions brings significant benefit to all of our stakeholders. For consumers, these transactions will mean better products at better prices with high-quality service. And a new company will be a significant contributor to the continued development of our national broadband infrastructure by bringing faster Internet speeds to more homes in more places with pro-consumer practices. We look forward to closing shortly so that we can produce the transaction benefits to the communities we serve. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,321967546,926814,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I mentioned on our last call that we migrated our customer reporting methodology to match the approach used by our peers and advance the closing and do a report last quarter and this quarter. As the results we issued today in our press releas",1476,"Thanks, Tom. I mentioned on our last call that we migrated our customer reporting methodology to match the approach used by our peers and advance the closing and do a report last quarter and this quarter. As the results we issued today in our press release and trending schedule, present a residential customer results using the doors methodology, our SMB video customers are now based on relationships instead of EBUs and we separately report enterprise PSUs to reflect our recent organizational changes. 
Our P&L presentation similarly separates SMB revenue from enterprise revenue. And obviously, our new presentation approach does not impact our overall financial results. And the customer PSU revenue and adjusted EBITDA trends that you see under the new methodology used today are very similar to the trends that you would see under the previous methodology. In fact, on Pages 2 and 4 of today's trending schedule, provide a results under the prior presentation methodology as well to provide a transparent transition. 
So starting with Slide 8 in today's presentation. During the fourth quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 191,000 versus 151,000 last year. And in video, we added 29,000 residential customers versus a loss of 3,000 last year. In Residential Internet, we added 115,000 customers and we grew residential voice customers by 47,000. 
Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 294,000 or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 2.3%, driven by a larger triple play-base and step-ups, loss rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet growth. 
As Slide 10 shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 7.2% compared to 8.3% last year, as we had lower rate increases in 2015. 
In commercial, we added 28,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year. And that improvement is being driven by a greater focus on customer types following the separation of our SMB and enterprise groups, the web launch of new pricing and packaging to the SMB marketplace in early 2015. 
Total commercial revenue grew by approximately 12% continues to reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure that we saw in residential when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in the middle of 2012.
Our advertising revenue was down about 19% year-over-year, driven by a $16 million decline in political in the fourth quarter given last year's election cycle. In total, our fourth quarter revenue was up by 6.4% year-over-year, 7.6%, excluding advertising. And for the full year, as Tom mentioned, we grew our revenue by 7.1%, 7.7%, excluding advertising. 
In dollar terms, revenue grew by nearly $650 million. If you exclude advertising, 2015 revenue grew by $678 million, more than the 650 -- $645 million in 2014. So we're pleased with the continued increase in revenue, especially when you consider that we took more modest rate increases than in 2014 and most of our 2015 revenue growth came from customer relationship growth. 
Turning to fourth quarter operating expense and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. Total operating expense grew by $89 million or 5.9% year-over-year with transition OpEx accounting for $22 million of our total OpEx this Quarter. These types of cost will eventually become integration cost post-closing. 
Excluding transition, total expenses grew by 5.3%. And on a full year basis, again, excluding transition, our expense base grew by $372 million year-over-year, that compares to $433 million in 2014. So if you step back, we're burning more dollars of revenue with less dollars of expense growth. 
Back to fourth quarter expenses. Programming expense grew by $49 million accounting for about half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 7.9% increase in fourth quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our peers and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers. 
Cost-to-service customers, which includes field operations, customer care and network operating cost was flat year-over-year despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth to 5.6%. We continue to get more efficient with lower service transaction volumes. 
Other costs grew by $28 million or about 15% year-over-year, and that's driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, which includes the insourcing of IT and software development resources and enterprise, as well as property taxes on previous CapEx and higher casualty claims due to more insourced employee base. 
Excluding transition-related expenses, the fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% year-over-year, which exceeds our revenue growth. Keep in mind that fourth quarter 2014 also benefited from political advertising.
Moving to Slide 13. Fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $548 million, with $49 million related to M&A transactions spend for the activities Tom covered. This platform investments began with the Comcast transactions and have provided us a head start to provide a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers post-closing. Excluding all-digital and transition CapEx in both periods, the fourth quarter CapEx was up by just over $24 million or 5%. That's driven primarily by investments in product development and timing. 
For the full year 2015 and when excluding transition CapEx, our CapEx totaled $1.725 billion as expected. In 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and acquisitions, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline year-over-year for Charter on a stand-alone basis. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow totaled $80 million, just below last year's level and the modest decline was driven by the impact of transition OpEx, CapEx and the largest and the most obvious one being the interest related to our acquisition financing. For the full year, our reported free cash flow grew to approximately $550 million, up from $170 million last year with adjusted EBITDA up, CapEx down, a positive working capital contribution, offset by transaction and transition cost. And as Tom mentioned, excluding the impact of our transactions specifically in -- for the full year, $72 million to operating expense, $115 million of CapEx, $260 million of cash interest and $70 million of transaction cost in other expenses, our 2015 full year free cash flow adjusted for the transaction spend was over $1 billion and over $9 per share.
At December 31, our leverage ratio was 4.1x on an LTM basis. So we've reached the low end of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5x. In November, we issued $2.5 million of high-yield notes to help finance our proposed transaction with TWC. And that placement, combined with the $19.3 billion of financings that we completed in July and August, totals to $21.8 billion of debt that we have in escrow on the balance sheet to finance our transactions. 
So we've fully placed all the financing for our transactions in the debt markets, assuming that TWC shareholders will select the $100 cash option. At close, we still expect to be levered at about 4.5x or lower. That 4.5x leverage is based on the new Charter's 2015 estimated adjusted EBITDA and also includes $500 million of year 1 synergies. 
Similar to Charter today, new Charter will be in a position to mechanically delever through adjusted EBITDA and cash flow growth. Our target leverage for new Charter will remain 4 to 4.5x, but we will look to manage our leverage to the lower end of that range and we're committed to maintaining an investment-grade index rating at the secured level with first lien leverage under 3.5x. To the extent that the $115 cash election were chosen by TWC shareholders, we also have a $4.3 billion high yield bridge in place to cover our needs. 
I should mention this morning, we launched a $1.5 billion, 144A offering and proceeds of which we intend to retain until the TWC shareholder election in closing. 
Turning to our tax assets on Slide 15. At the end of the year, we had $8 billion of tax basis in our assets and $11.3 billion in NOLs, for a total of $19.3 billion in tax assets, about $700 million more than we had at the end of 2014. The year-over-year increase in the total tax assets was primarily driven by our previously disclosed partnership liquidation that we executed in the third quarter. 
Some of our tax base has also moved over to the NOL bucket in the course of 2015 given regular depreciation and amortization, utilization of bonus depreciation, and accelerated tax benefits related to new tangible property regulations. The net present value of those tax assets are worth well over $3 billion today. With the combined tax assets, new Charter will be worth well over $6 billion in NPV, the reasons we've highlighted previously. We don't expect new Charter to be a significant cash tax payer until 2018. And even then, at a significantly reduced cash tax rate for several years.

So Ben, if you take a step at a high level. 2015 had very little in the way of price increases as well. So 2016 is not going to be that dramatic. The reality is if you're growing your residential customer base at 5% plus, there's not much that you need to be doing on the rate side and you can be extremely competitive and go to grow and provide value to consumers. And so 2016, we have more momentum in the marketplace than we did coming into 2015 and there's even less need than in the past to have to take rate increases. You also have SMB and enterprise, which right now, you've seen a decelerating trend on revenue growth or an accelerating trend on PSU growth. And we'd expect that over time SMB and enterprise would perform a lot like residential did in the late 2012, 2013 time frame. And our goal is to reaccelerate the growth for revenue, not just customers and PSUs on that side as well. Clearly, we're in a political advertising year as well and sometimes that's unclear how much of that is going to flow to you. But similar to what we've done in prior years, we'll always isolate that political advertising, so people have clarity around it so that they can isolate the growth rates in the good and in the bad. So we'll be doing that throughout the course of this year as well. So I don't think that, to put it bluntly, I don't think that a lower amount of rate increase really has a dramatic impact because of our improved ability to grow."

But I think we can begin the process by the end of this year. The big issue interestingly, we've gotten all the bugs that we think could exist out of this system and it works very well. The choice before us will be, do we roll it out on every outlet in mass or do we roll it out incrementally to just new customers and then begin to make it optional to existing customers. And the tension there is that there are some people that just are confused by new user interfaces and you have to manage that process and the customer education, as well as the desire to get a highly functional UI out in front of everyone simultaneously. So we're still wrestling with the right rollout strategy. But operationally, it works very well, and it's capable of being fully deployed."

A lot of people focus on CP as being one of the big drivers and it is primarily because it's the easiest to model. So the drivers around that are -- once you've gone all-digital, you need less CPE per transaction. So just by growing all-digital on a go-forward basis, you require less CPE for every gross add. The second element is that we're buying boxes at dramatically lower prices, well over 50% reduction from we were buying that. And that's being driven by the introduction of Worldbox, but even the path to getting to Worldbox produce those type of prices for us. And by extending the license CPE through Spectrum Guide that obviously has a big impact on capital intensity. The pieces that are, in some respects, even more material but harder to model include that the business is increasingly becoming more cloud-based. And by developing and putting platforms in the cloud as opposed to the local level, you can figure video-on-demand as just a one type of example. You can get better scale on any cable system by doing that and become more efficient from a capital perspective. Another area that's also harder to model is that today, when you take a look at TWC Charter and Bright House, 3 companies doing their own development and building and standing up a platforms, whether that's data centers or product development or IT platforms and that gets to be done in a single instance as opposed to 3 different times. So that there's a benefit to the transaction of putting these 3 companies together and being able to develop faster and at a cheaper cost per passing or per dollar of revenue. And the final one, I think, this is the one that's probably the most misunderstood, I think you're referencing the proxy statement that we had the type CapEx forecast is, simply when you have higher revenue growth, then you should take a look at our results today. When you have higher revenue growth, you have a higher dollar value of revenue per passing in an environment where a good portion of your capital expenditure is fixed capital spend. And so simply by growing revenue faster, you can drop your capital intensity by having a better utilization and fixed set of assets and a fixed capital cost. So that's the piece that I think that's the most misunderstood is in those proxy statements, which I'm not sitting here and reiterating today, although we were intelligent when we put them together, the reality is those CapEx dollars decreasing, the capital intensity was declining significantly for all the reasons I mentioned. But a big driver of that is simply being able to drive higher revenue growth on a fixed set of passings."

We were going to invest more in service and we were going to invest more in every a transaction by putting more equipment and gear into the home, and that's how we were going to make money, which is a little bit counterintuitive until you think about the fact by lowering the pricing on every single one of your product, you have the opportunity to sell more over time and get more revenue per household and get more efficient for all the reasons that we talked about. So we told people at the time that success would be defined by accelerating and not our customer relationship growth, better sell in to multiple products in the household, PSU growth as a result and then several quarters on you'd see a re-acceleration of the revenue growth, which would be stunted short term by putting in the high-value pricing and packaging. And then over time, you'd see EBITDA growth and reduction at capital intensity, all of which you've seen at Charter and it does provide the baseline model. The difference is being, going forward is, we think we can do it faster because of the status of where TWC and Bright House are already at in terms of the quality of the plant and some improvements even in the past year. And the fact that we'll have transaction benefits as a result that can be reinvested into the business along the way to bring better products faster to the TWC and Bright House customers."

Almost all of our customer -- or the vast majority of our customers subscribe to us and over-the-top services.

With regard to gross adds and the share where they're coming from, I'm not sure whether they're -- the economic or the macroeconomic situation has changed at all because growth rates in the country and for all MVPDs. We think that in our -- where we operate, our video share is about 50%. And so we think that we have a tremendous upside to grow our own business with the quality of video services that we can build and provide and with the service infrastructure we've built around that. I do think -- we talked about the macro issues previously and the pressures on video, most of which, I think, are economic, the cost have been high. It does look like cost have moderated a little bit on the margin, and that's partially because over-the-top is affecting the value of content in a good way from our perspective. And so, I'm not -- we'll have to look at the macro trends, but in terms of what our growth opportunities are, our biggest growth opportunity is to take video share from existing providers, assuming that we had better products and services."

Charter Spectrum, our advanced and high value product suite, continues to attract consumers. Our residential and commercial customer growth continues to accelerate and Charter remains the fastest growing cable company in the United States.",1469,"Thanks, Stefan. Charter Spectrum, our advanced and high value product suite, continues to attract consumers. Our residential and commercial customer growth continues to accelerate and Charter remains the fastest growing cable company in the United States. By providing highly competitive products at attractive price points and simple packages with quality service, we will continue to add customer relationships inside both Charter's legacy footprint and new Charter's broader footprint. We'll do that by applying the same customer-friendly operating strategy that Time Warner Cable and Bright House assets as we migrate those footprints to our Spectrum product pricing packaging and customer-friendly operating practices. 
We finished 2015 with 6.7 million residential and small business customers. For the full year, that base customers grew by 6%, with residential customer growth -- growing by 5% and SMB growing by 17%. We grew our total video customer base by 11,000 relationships in 2015 compared to a loss of 78,000 last year. This is the first time in over a decade that Charter has added video customers over any 12-month period. 
Driving that growth is an improved video offering with better pictures, more HD than satellite, video-on-demand and interactive guide functionality on every TV outlet, combined with high-quality, insourced and U.S.-based customer service, all in an easy-to-understand pricing and packaging structure, which makes our products competitive well beyond the point of sale. 
We also continued to grow our Internet business in 2015. We added nearly 450,000 Residential Internet customers, up 9% compared to last year. Our low-cost, high-speed Internet offering provides great value to consumers whether purchased inside one of our bundles or on a stand-alone basis. Nearly 1/3 of our total residential customers, close to 2 million customers, are now non-video customers and that grew by about 18% year-over-year. As of the end of the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of our Residential Internet customers subscribe to Internet service that provided speeds of 60 megabits or more. 
We continue to be an industry leader in Internet customer growth by offering high speeds at low price points with no data caps, no usage based billing, no modem rental fees, and that's been our operating practice for the last 4 years and we plan to continue that. 
In commercial, we also continue to drive accelerating customer growth. After we separated our small business and enterprise segments early last year, we launched new pricing and packaging to both marketplaces and are seeing the results we expected. SMB PSU growth accelerated by 30% in 2015 and 47% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In time, that accelerating commercial unit growth will drive faster revenue growth as it has in residential. Business services remains an area of significant long-term opportunity for Charter and we've demonstrated that we can grow business customers faster with a highly competitive operating strategy. 
For the full year, we grew our revenue by 7.1%. Excluding advertising, revenue grew by 7.7%, all while taking meaningful lower price increases than in 2014. Our EBITDA growth, excluding transition costs, grew by 8.5% and continued to exceed our revenue growth. That EBITDA growth, combined with declining capital intensity, is driving greater free cash flow conversion. We generated approximately $550 million of free cash flow in 2015, up from approximately $170 million last year. Excluding M&A-related cost, our free cash flow was even higher, over $1 billion, up $700 million compared to 2014 on the same basis. So as we continue to grow our EBITDA and our capital intensity declines, Charter is becoming a meaningful generator of free cash.
In 2016, we have 3 key priorities, executing on our core customer growth strategy in both residential and commercial; making the Spectrum product set even better; and finally, closing and integrating Time Warner Cable and Bright House.
Starting with our core customer growth strategy, we remain focused on growing our business by increasing long-lasting customer relationships rather than through just price increases. We grow loyal customer relationships by going to market with the simple high-quality products Charter Spectrum, which we offer at very affordable prices and those prices will essentially remain flat in 2016.
Over the past 4 years, we've hired over 7,000 people to help us support our products with customer service provided by our own people as opposed to contract labor offshore. In the new company, we'll need to hire about 20,000 more people to do the same proportionally. As we train and manage our own employees, we're creating a skilled labor force that is executing higher-quality service transactions with our customers when we sell and provision, install, answer billing questions or handle repairs. Today, nearly 90% of our customer calls are handled onshore and in-house and 95% of our service truck rolls are in-house. Those higher-quality customer interactions are reducing service transactions, reducing churn and creating longer customer relationships supporting greater customer growth and reducing our operating cost.
We're also making Spectrum products even better. Through the course of 2016, we're rolling out our new cloud-based Spectrum Guide. Our initial Spectrum Guide launches are working and scaling well with positive customer response. Spectrum Guide's more intuitive and feature-rich user interface improves both video search and discovery, fully enables our on-demand offering and allows us to include Internet video in the guide, which enhances the value of our service. And because the guide is cloud-based and will work across nearly all of our 10 million set-top boxes, we can launch and refresh the guide without purchasing or installing new set-top boxes.  
By avoiding deployment of new boxes, Spectrum Guide minimizes customers’ disruption and accelerates the time to put a modern UI on every outlet. 
It turns every TV into a connected smart TV and allows us to integrate third-party video services, including over-the-top providers like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon prime, giving customers the ability to search and view all the content they're interested in without changing consumer-owned hardware or devices. We're also designing Spectrum Guide for dynamic ad insertion as a way to enhance targeting and enable programmers to reduce ad loads with less revenue risk. 
Over the course of 2016, we'll also expand our on-demand library with thousands of additional titles and we'll continue to improve our capabilities on additional devices with further live on-demand downloadable content to-go. And in the Internet, we're beginning to roll out our Spectrum WiFi, which provides unlimited Internet access to residential customers when they're outside the home. 
All these product improvements enhancements will be offered to Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers, so they will fully benefit from the collective and product development of these 3 companies. 
Turning to our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, we've made good progress in working with the regulators and other stakeholders, financing the transactions and planning the integration. We've met the closing conditions for franchise approvals. And at the federal level, we continue to work closely with the FCC and DOJ to make sure they have the information they need and we remain hopeful that the process can be completed in March. 
In January, we received approval for our transactions from the New York State Public Service Commission and at the state level, we're still waiting on New Jersey, Hawaii and California. We will continue to work with state authorities to achieve a faster time line as we have 90,000 employees waiting to become part of the new company and we don't want to delay the significant consumer benefits that our transactions deliver.
From a balance sheet employee and operational perspective, we're ready to close. In early November, we completed the process of placing our acquisition financing in the debt markets and have additional financing commitments if needed. We're making good progress on integration plans, focusing on organizational structure and systems, all digital new pricing and packaging, Spectrum Guide and Worldbox rollouts. 
Our integration planning and investments, including insourcing of various IT product and service platforms will allow us to project uniform pricing, packaging and services across a national footprint, which will accelerate the integration of the 3 companies. Those cloud infrastructure investments include a billing isolation layer, a new provisioning architecture and a unified biller-agnostic customer service platform in call centers and in the field. These investments will help to simplify product, standardize service interactions in a consistent way without the time, cost and risk of migrating multiple third-party platforms. 
These transactions brings significant benefit to all of our stakeholders. For consumers, these transactions will mean better products at better prices with high-quality service. And a new company will be a significant contributor to the continued development of our national broadband infrastructure by bringing faster Internet speeds to more homes in more places with pro-consumer practices. We look forward to closing shortly so that we can produce the transaction benefits to the communities we serve. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."

I mentioned on our last call that we migrated our customer reporting methodology to match the approach used by our peers in advance of closing and do a report last quarter and this quarter. The results we issued today in our press release and trending schedule present our residential customer results using the doors methodology, our SMB video customers are now based on relationships instead of EBUs and we separately report enterprise PSUs to reflect our recent organizational changes. 
Our P&L presentation similarly separates SMB revenue from enterprise revenue. And obviously, our new presentation approach does not impact our overall financial results. And the customer PSU revenue and adjusted EBITDA trends that you see under the new methodology used today are very similar to the trends that you would see under the previous methodology. In fact, Pages 2 and 4 of today's trending schedule provide a results under the prior presentation methodology as well to provide a transparent transition. 
So starting with Slide 8 in today's presentation. During the fourth quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 191,000 versus 151,000 last year. And in video, we added 29,000 residential customers versus a loss of 3,000 last year. In Residential Internet, we added 115,000 customers and we grew residential voice customers by 47,000. 
Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 294,000 or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 2.3%, driven by a larger triple play-base and step-ups, loss rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet growth. 
As Slide 10 shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 7.2% compared to 8.3% last year, as we had lower rate increases in 2015. 
In commercial, we added 28,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year. And that improvement is being driven by a greater focus on customer types following the separation of our SMB and enterprise groups combined with the web launch of new pricing and packaging to the SMB marketplace in early 2015. 
Total commercial revenue grew by approximately 12% continues to reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure that we saw in residential when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in the middle of 2012.
Our advertising revenue was down about 19% year-over-year, driven by a $16 million decline in political in the fourth quarter given last year's election cycle. In total, our fourth quarter revenue was up by 6.4% year-over-year, 7.6%, excluding advertising. And for the full year, as Tom mentioned, we grew our revenue by 7.1%, 7.7%, excluding advertising. 
In dollar terms, revenue grew by nearly $650 million. If you exclude advertising, 2015 revenue grew by $678 million, more than the 650 -- $645 million in 2014. So we're pleased with the continued increase in revenue, especially when you consider that we took more modest rate increases than in 2014 and most of our 2015 revenue growth came from customer relationship growth. 
Turning to fourth quarter operating expense and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. Total operating expense grew by $89 million or 5.9% year-over-year with transition OpEx accounting for $22 million of our total OpEx this Quarter. These types of costs will eventually become integration costs post-closing. 
Excluding transition, total expenses grew by 5.3%. And on a full year basis, again, excluding transition, our expense base grew by $372 million year-over-year. That compares to $433 million in 2014. So if you step back, we're growing more dollars of revenue with less dollars in expense growth. 
Back to fourth quarter expenses. Programming expense grew by $49 million accounting for about half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 7.9% increase in fourth quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our peers and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers. 
Cost-to-service customers, which includes field operations, customer care and network operating cost, was flat year-over-year despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.6%. We continue to get more efficient with lower service transaction volumes. 
Other costs grew by $28 million or about 15% year-over-year, and that's driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, which includes the insourcing of IT and software development resources and enterprise, as well as property taxes on previous CapEx and higher casualty claims due to more insourced employee base. 
Excluding transition-related expenses, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% year-over-year, which exceeds our revenue growth. Keep in mind that fourth quarter 2014 also benefited from political advertising.
Moving to Slide 13. Fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $548 million, with $49 million related to M&A transactions spend for the activities Tom covered. Those platform investments began with the Comcast transactions and have provided us a head start to provide a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers post-closing. Excluding all-digital and transition CapEx in both periods, our fourth quarter CapEx was up by just over $24 million or 5%. That's driven primarily by investments in product development and timing. 
For the full year 2015 and when excluding transition CapEx, our CapEx totaled $1.725 billion as expected. In 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and acquisitions, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline year-over-year for Charter on a stand-alone basis. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow totaled $80 million, just below last year's level and the modest decline was driven by the impact of transition OpEx, CapEx and the largest and most obvious one being the interest related to our acquisition financing. For the full year, our reported free cash flow grew to approximately $550 million, up from $170 million last year with adjusted EBITDA up, CapEx down, a positive working capital contribution, offset by transaction and transition cost. And as Tom mentioned, excluding the impact of our transactions specifically in -- for the full year, $72 million to operating expense, $115 million of CapEx, $260 million of cash interest and $70 million of transaction cost in other expenses, our 2015 full year free cash flow adjusted for the transaction spend was over $1 billion and over $9 per share.
At December 31, our leverage ratio was 4.1x on an LTM basis. So we've reached the low end of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5x. In November, we issued $2.5 million of high-yield notes to help finance our proposed transaction with TWC. And that placement, combined with the $19.3 billion of financings that we completed in July and August, totals to $21.8 billion of debt that we have in escrow on the balance sheet to finance our transactions. 
So we've fully placed all the financing for our transactions in the debt markets, assuming that TWC shareholders select the $100 cash option. At close, we still expect to be levered at about 4.5x or lower. That 4.5x leverage is based on the new Charter's 2015 estimated adjusted EBITDA and also includes $500 million of year 1 synergies. 
Similar to Charter today, new Charter will be in a position to mechanically delever through adjusted EBITDA and cash flow growth. Our target leverage for new Charter will remain 4x to 4.5x, but we will look to manage our leverage to the lower end of that range and we're committed to maintaining an investment-grade index rating at the secured level with first lien leverage under 3.5x. To the extent that the $115 cash election were chosen by TWC shareholders, we also have a $4.3 billion high yield bridge in place to cover our needs. 
I should mention this morning, we launched a $1.5 billion, 144A offering, the proceeds of which we intend to retain until the TWC shareholder election and closing. 
Turning to our tax assets on Slide 15. At the end of the year, we had $8 billion of tax basis in our assets and $11.3 billion in NOLs, for a total of $19.3 billion in tax assets, about $700 million more than we had at the end of 2014. The year-over-year increase in the total tax assets was primarily driven by our previously disclosed partnership liquidation that we executed in the third quarter. 
Some of our tax base has also moved over to the NOL bucket in the course of 2015 given regular depreciation and amortization, utilization of bonus depreciation, and accelerated tax benefits related to new tangible property regulations. The net present value of those tax assets are worth well over $3 billion today. With the combined tax assets, new Charter will be worth well over $6 billion in NPV for the reasons we've highlighted previously. We don't expect new Charter to be a significant cash tax payer until 2018. And even then, at a significantly reduced cash tax rate for several years.

So Ben, if you take a step back at a high level. 2015 had very little in the way of price increases as well. So 2016 is not going to be that dramatic. The reality is if you're growing your residential customer base at 5% plus, there's not much that you need to be doing on the rate side and you can be extremely competitive and go to grow and provide value to consumers. And so 2016, we have more momentum in the marketplace than we did coming into 2015 and there's even less need than in the past to have to take rate increases. You also have SMB and enterprise, which right now, you've seen a decelerating trend on revenue growth or an accelerating trend on PSU growth. And we'd expect that over time SMB and enterprise would perform a lot like residential did in the late 2012, 2013 time frame. And our goal is to reaccelerate the growth for revenue, not just customers and PSUs on that side as well. Clearly, we're in a political advertising year as well and sometimes that's unclear how much of that is going to flow to you. But similar to what we've done in prior years, we'll always isolate that political advertising, so people have clarity around it so that they can isolate the growth rates in the good and in the bad. So we'll be doing that throughout the course of this year as well. So I don't think that, to put it bluntly, I don't think that a lower amount of rate increase really has a dramatic impact because of our improved ability to grow."

And so we will not, assuming we close some time in the near future on those companies, we're not going to get them completely rolled out this fiscal year. But I think we can begin the process by the end of this year. The big issue interestingly, we've gotten all the bugs that we think could exist out of this system and it works very well. The choice before us will be, do we roll it out on every outlet en masse or do we roll it out incrementally to just new customers and then begin to make it optional to existing customers. And the tension there is that there are some people that just are confused by new user interfaces and you have to manage that process and the customer education, as well as the desire to get a highly functional UI out in front of everyone simultaneously. So we're still wrestling with the right rollout strategy. But operationally, it works very well, and it's capable of being fully deployed."

A lot of people focus on CP as being one of the big drivers and it is primarily because it's the easiest to model. So the drivers around that are -- once you've gone all-digital, you need less CPE per transaction. So just by going all-digital on a go-forward basis, you require less CPE for every gross add. The second element is that we're buying boxes at dramatically lower prices, well over 50% reduction from where we were buying that. And that's being driven by the introduction of Worldbox, but even the path to getting to Worldbox produce those type of prices for us. And by extending the license CPE through Spectrum Guide, that obviously has a big impact on capital intensity. The pieces that are, in some respects, even more material but harder to model include that the business is increasingly becoming more cloud-based. And by developing and putting platforms in the cloud as opposed to the local level, you can think of video-on-demand as just a one type of example. You can get better scale on any cable system by doing that and become more efficient from a capital perspective. Another area that's also harder to model is that today, when you take a look at TWC Charter and Bright House, 3 companies doing their own development and building and standing up of platforms, whether that's data centers or product development or IT platforms and that gets to be done in a single instance as opposed to 3 different times. So that there's a benefit to the transaction of putting these 3 companies together and being able to develop faster and at a cheaper cost per passing or per dollar of revenue. And the final one, I think, this is the one that's probably the most misunderstood, I think you're referencing the proxy statement that we had in the type [ph] CapEx forecast is, simply when you have higher revenue growth, then you should take a look at our results today. When you have higher revenue growth, you have a higher dollar value of revenue per passing in an environment where a good portion of your capital expenditure is fixed capital spend. And so simply by growing revenue faster, you can drop your capital intensity by having a better utilization of a fixed set of assets and a fixed capital cost. So that's the piece that I think that's the most misunderstood is in those proxy statements, which I'm not sitting here and reiterating today, although we were intelligent when we put them together, the reality is those CapEx dollars weren't decreasing, the capital intensity was declining significantly for all the reasons I mentioned. But a big driver of that is simply being able to drive higher revenue growth on a fixed set of passings."

And as a result of the infrastructure we've put in place and the practices we've put in place and the changes we've done to our customer service operation, all of which ultimately improve customer life, customer satisfaction and reduce transaction volume in the business, which reduces selling expenses and cost to serve. Broadband growth, I think, is an opportunity for us, Charter -- the Charter story and I think the story for the New Charter is that it's an underpenetrated business. And if you look at the market share that the telcos have in Internet service and in the satellite companies have in video service and the share that telcos have in business services, we have a lot of growth in front of us and we have good products that are driving that growth."

Then over the course of the year, we had the regular depreciation and amortization. And the continued D&A of our excess tax basis.

We were going to invest more in service and we were going to invest more in every transaction by putting more equipment and gear into the home, and that's how we were going to make money, which is a little bit counterintuitive until you think about the fact by lowering the pricing on every single one of your product, you have the opportunity to sell more over time and get more revenue per household and get more efficient for all the reasons that we talked about. So we told people at the time that success would be defined by accelerating and not our customer relationship growth, better sell in to multiple products in the household, PSU growth as a result and then several quarters on you'd see a re-acceleration of the revenue growth, which would be stunted short term by putting in the high-value pricing and packaging. And then over time, you'd see EBITDA growth and reduction at capital intensity, all of which you've seen at Charter and it does provide the baseline model. The difference is being, going forward is, we think we can do it faster because of the status of where TWC and Bright House are already at in terms of the quality of the plant and some improvements even in the past year. And the fact that we'll have transaction benefits as a result that can be reinvested into the business along the way to bring better products faster to the TWC and Bright House customers."

We think that in our -- where we operate, our video share is about 50%. And so we think that we have a tremendous upside to grow our own business with the quality of video services that we can build and provide and with the service infrastructure we've built around that. I do think -- we talked about the macro issues previously and the pressures on video, most of which, I think, are economic, the costs have been high. It does look like costs have moderated a little bit on the margin, and that's partially because over-the-top is affecting the value of content in a good way from our perspective. And so, I'm not -- we'll have to look at the macro trends, but in terms of what our growth opportunities are, our biggest growth opportunity is to take video share from existing providers, assuming that we had better products and services."

We'll do that by applying the same customer-friendly operating strategy that Time Warner Cable and Bright House assets as we migrate those footprints to our Spectrum product pricing packaging and customer-friendly operating practices. 
We finished 2015 with 6.7 million residential and small business customers. For the full year, that base customers grew by 6%, with residential customer growth -- growing by 5% and SMB growing by 17%. We grew our total video customer base by 11,000 relationships in 2015 compared to a loss of 78,000 last year. This is the first time in over a decade that Charter has added video customers over any 12-month period. 
Driving that growth is an improved video offering with better pictures, more HD than satellite, video-on-demand and interactive guide functionality on every TV outlet, combined with high-quality, insourced and U.S.-based customer service, all in an easy-to-understand pricing and packaging structure, which makes our products competitive well beyond the point of sale. 
We also continued to grow our Internet business in 2015. We added nearly 450,000 Residential Internet customers, up 9% compared to last year. Our low-cost, high-speed Internet offering provides great value to consumers whether purchased inside one of our bundles or on a stand-alone basis. Nearly 1/3 of our total residential customers, close to 2 million customers, are now non-video customers and that grew by about 18% year-over-year. As of the end of the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of our Residential Internet customers subscribe to Internet service that provided speeds of 60 megabits or more. 
We continue to be an industry leader in Internet customer growth by offering high speeds at low price points with no data caps, no usage based billing, no modem rental fees, and that's been our operating practice for the last 4 years and we plan to continue that. 
In commercial, we also continue to drive accelerating customer growth. After we separated our small business and enterprise segments early last year, we launched new pricing and packaging to both marketplaces and are seeing the results we expected. SMB PSU growth accelerated by 30% in 2015 and 47% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In time, that accelerating commercial unit growth will drive faster revenue growth as it has in residential. Business services remains an area of significant long-term opportunity for Charter and we've demonstrated that we can grow business customers faster with a highly competitive operating strategy. 
For the full year, we grew our revenue by 7.1%. Excluding advertising, revenue grew by 7.7%, all while taking meaningful lower price increases than in 2014. Our EBITDA growth, excluding transition costs, grew by 8.5% and continued to exceed our revenue growth. That EBITDA growth, combined with declining capital intensity, is driving greater free cash flow conversion. We generated approximately $550 million of free cash flow in 2015, up from approximately $170 million last year. Excluding M&A-related cost, our free cash flow was even higher, over $1 billion, up $700 million compared to 2014 on the same basis. So as we continue to grow our EBITDA and our capital intensity declines, Charter is becoming a meaningful generator of free cash.
In 2016, we have 3 key priorities, executing on our core customer growth strategy in both residential and commercial; making the Spectrum product set even better; and finally, closing and integrating Time Warner Cable and Bright House.
Starting with our core customer growth strategy, we remain focused on growing our business by increasing long-lasting customer relationships rather than through just price increases. We grow loyal customer relationships by going to market with the simple high-quality products Charter Spectrum, which we offer at very affordable prices and those prices will essentially remain flat in 2016.
Over the past 4 years, we've hired over 7,000 people to help us support our products with customer service provided by our own people as opposed to contract labor offshore. In the new company, we'll need to hire about 20,000 more people to do the same proportionally. As we train and manage our own employees, we're creating a skilled labor force that is executing higher-quality service transactions with our customers when we sell and provision, install, answer billing questions or handle repairs. Today, nearly 90% of our customer calls are handled onshore and in-house and 95% of our service truck rolls are in-house. Those higher-quality customer interactions are reducing service transactions, reducing churn and creating longer customer relationships supporting greater customer growth and reducing our operating cost.
We're also making Spectrum products even better. Through the course of 2016, we're rolling out our new cloud-based Spectrum Guide. Our initial Spectrum Guide launches are working and scaling well with positive customer response. Spectrum Guide's more intuitive and feature-rich user interface improves both video search and discovery, fully enables our on-demand offering and allows us to include Internet video in the guide, which enhances the value of our service. And because the guide is cloud-based and will work across nearly all of our 10 million set-top boxes, we can launch and refresh the guide without purchasing or installing new set-top boxes. 
By avoiding deployment of new boxes, Spectrum Guide minimizes customers’ disruption and accelerates the time to put a modern UI on every outlet. 
It turns every TV into a connected smart TV and allows us to integrate third-party video services, including over-the-top providers like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon prime, giving customers the ability to search and view all the content they're interested in without changing consumer-owned hardware or devices. We're also designing Spectrum Guide for dynamic ad insertion as a way to enhance targeting and enable programmers to reduce ad loads with less revenue risk. 
Over the course of 2016, we'll also expand our on-demand library with thousands of additional titles and we'll continue to improve our capabilities on additional devices with further live on-demand downloadable content to-go. And in the Internet, we're beginning to roll out our Spectrum WiFi, which provides unlimited Internet access to residential customers when they're outside the home. 
All these product improvements enhancements will be offered to Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers, so they will fully benefit from the collective and product development of these 3 companies. 
Turning to our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, we've made good progress in working with the regulators and other stakeholders, financing the transactions and planning the integration. We've met the closing conditions for franchise approvals. And at the federal level, we continue to work closely with the FCC and DOJ to make sure they have the information they need and we remain hopeful that the process can be completed in March. 
In January, we received approval for our transactions from the New York State Public Service Commission and at the state level, we're still waiting on New Jersey, Hawaii and California. We will continue to work with state authorities to achieve a faster time line as we have 90,000 employees waiting to become part of the new company and we don't want to delay the significant consumer benefits that our transactions deliver.
From a balance sheet employee and operational perspective, we're ready to close. In early November, we completed the process of placing our acquisition financing in the debt markets and have additional financing commitments if needed. We're making good progress on integration plans, focusing on organizational structure and systems, all digital new pricing and packaging, Spectrum Guide and Worldbox rollouts. 
Our integration planning and investments, including insourcing of various IT product and service platforms will allow us to project uniform pricing, packaging and services across a national footprint, which will accelerate the integration of the 3 companies. Those cloud infrastructure investments include a billing isolation layer, a new provisioning architecture and a unified biller-agnostic customer service platform in call centers and in the field. These investments will help to simplify product, standardize service interactions in a consistent way without the time, cost and risk of migrating multiple third-party platforms. 
These transactions brings significant benefit to all of our stakeholders. For consumers, these transactions will mean better products at better prices with high-quality service. And a new company will be a significant contributor to the continued development of our national broadband infrastructure by bringing faster Internet speeds to more homes in more places with pro-consumer practices. We look forward to closing shortly so that we can produce the transaction benefits to the communities we serve. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris."
19609,321967546,927122,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I mentioned on our last call that we migrated our customer reporting methodology to match the approach used by our peers in advance of closing and do a report last quarter and this quarter. The results we issued today in our press release and",1474,"Thanks, Tom. I mentioned on our last call that we migrated our customer reporting methodology to match the approach used by our peers in advance of closing and do a report last quarter and this quarter. The results we issued today in our press release and trending schedule present our residential customer results using the doors methodology, our SMB video customers are now based on relationships instead of EBUs and we separately report enterprise PSUs to reflect our recent organizational changes. 
Our P&L presentation similarly separates SMB revenue from enterprise revenue. And obviously, our new presentation approach does not impact our overall financial results. And the customer PSU revenue and adjusted EBITDA trends that you see under the new methodology used today are very similar to the trends that you would see under the previous methodology. In fact, Pages 2 and 4 of today's trending schedule provide a results under the prior presentation methodology as well to provide a transparent transition. 
So starting with Slide 8 in today's presentation. During the fourth quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 191,000 versus 151,000 last year. And in video, we added 29,000 residential customers versus a loss of 3,000 last year. In Residential Internet, we added 115,000 customers and we grew residential voice customers by 47,000. 
Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 294,000 or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 2.3%, driven by a larger triple play-base and step-ups, loss rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet growth. 
As Slide 10 shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 7.2% compared to 8.3% last year, as we had lower rate increases in 2015. 
In commercial, we added 28,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year. And that improvement is being driven by a greater focus on customer types following the separation of our SMB and enterprise groups combined with the web launch of new pricing and packaging to the SMB marketplace in early 2015. 
Total commercial revenue grew by approximately 12% continues to reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure that we saw in residential when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in the middle of 2012.
Our advertising revenue was down about 19% year-over-year, driven by a $16 million decline in political in the fourth quarter given last year's election cycle. In total, our fourth quarter revenue was up by 6.4% year-over-year, 7.6%, excluding advertising. And for the full year, as Tom mentioned, we grew our revenue by 7.1%, 7.7%, excluding advertising. 
In dollar terms, revenue grew by nearly $650 million. If you exclude advertising, 2015 revenue grew by $678 million, more than the 650 -- $645 million in 2014. So we're pleased with the continued increase in revenue, especially when you consider that we took more modest rate increases than in 2014 and most of our 2015 revenue growth came from customer relationship growth. 
Turning to fourth quarter operating expense and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. Total operating expense grew by $89 million or 5.9% year-over-year with transition OpEx accounting for $22 million of our total OpEx this Quarter. These types of costs will eventually become integration costs post-closing. 
Excluding transition, total expenses grew by 5.3%. And on a full year basis, again, excluding transition, our expense base grew by $372 million year-over-year. That compares to $433 million in 2014. So if you step back, we're growing more dollars of revenue with less dollars in expense growth. 
Back to fourth quarter expenses. Programming expense grew by $49 million accounting for about half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 7.9% increase in fourth quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our expanded video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our peers and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers. 
Cost-to-service customers, which includes field operations, customer care and network operating cost, was flat year-over-year despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.6%. We continue to get more efficient with lower service transaction volumes. 
Other costs grew by $28 million or about 15% year-over-year, and that's driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, which includes the insourcing of IT and software development resources and enterprise as well as property taxes on previous CapEx and higher casualty claims due to more insourced employee base. 
Excluding transition-related expenses, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% year-over-year, which exceeds our revenue growth. Keep in mind that fourth quarter 2014 also benefited from political advertising.
Moving to Slide 13. Fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $548 million, with $49 million related to M&A transactions spend for the activities Tom covered. Those platform investments began with the Comcast transactions and have provided us a head start to provide a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers post-closing. Excluding all-digital and transition CapEx in both periods, our fourth quarter CapEx was up by just over $24 million or 5%. That's driven primarily by investments in product development and timing. 
For the full year 2015 and when excluding transition CapEx, our CapEx totaled $1.725 billion as expected. In 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and acquisitions, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline year-over-year for Charter on a stand-alone basis. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow totaled $80 million, just below last year's level and the modest decline was driven by the impact of transition OpEx, CapEx and the largest and most obvious one being the interest related to our acquisition financing. For the full year, our reported free cash flow grew to approximately $550 million, up from $170 million last year with adjusted EBITDA up, CapEx down, a positive working capital contribution, offset by transaction and transition cost. And as Tom mentioned, excluding the impact of our transactions specifically in -- for the full year, $72 million to operating expense, $115 million of CapEx, $260 million of cash interest and $70 million of transaction cost in other expenses, our 2015 full year free cash flow adjusted for the transaction spend was over $1 billion and over $9 per share.
At December 31, our leverage ratio was 4.1x on an LTM basis. So we've reached the low end of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5x. In November, we issued $2.5 million of high-yield notes to help finance our proposed transaction with TWC. And that placement, combined with the $19.3 billion of financings that we completed in July and August, totals to $21.8 billion of debt that we have in escrow on the balance sheet to finance our transactions. 
So we've fully placed all the financing for our transactions in the debt markets, assuming that TWC shareholders select the $100 cash option. At close, we still expect to be levered at about 4.5x or lower. That 4.5x leverage is based on the new Charter's 2015 estimated adjusted EBITDA and also includes $500 million of year 1 synergies. 
Similar to Charter today, new Charter will be in a position to mechanically delever through adjusted EBITDA and cash flow growth. Our target leverage for new Charter will remain 4 to 4.5x, but we will look to manage our leverage to the lower end of that range and we're committed to maintaining an investment-grade index rating at the secured level with first lien leverage under 3.5x. To the extent that the $115 cash election were chosen by TWC shareholders, we also have a $4.3 billion high yield bridge in place to cover our needs. 
I should mention this morning, we launched a $1.5 billion, 144A offering, the proceeds of which we intend to retain until the TWC shareholder election and closing. 
Turning to our tax assets on Slide 15. At the end of the year, we had $8 billion of tax basis in our assets and $11.3 billion in NOLs, for a total of $19.3 billion in tax assets, about $700 million more than we had at the end of 2014. The year-over-year increase in the total tax assets was primarily driven by our previously disclosed partnership liquidation that we executed in the third quarter. 
Some of our tax base has also moved over to the NOL bucket in the course of 2015 given regular depreciation and amortization, utilization of bonus depreciation, and accelerated tax benefits related to new tangible property regulations. The net present value of those tax assets are worth well over $3 billion today. With the combined tax assets, new Charter will be worth well over $6 billion in NPV for the reasons we've highlighted previously. We don't expect new Charter to be a significant cash tax payer until 2018. And even then, at a significantly reduced cash tax rate for several years.

The reality is if you're growing your residential customer base at 5% plus, there's not much that you need to be doing on the rate side and you can be extremely competitive and go to grow and provide value to consumers. And so 2016, we have more momentum in the marketplace than we did coming into 2015 and there's even less need than in the past to have to take rate increases. You also have SMB and enterprise, which right now, you've seen a decelerating trend on revenue growth or an accelerating trend on PSU growth. And we'd expect that over time SMB and enterprise would perform a lot like residential did in the late 2012, 2013 time frame. And our goal is to reaccelerate the growth for revenue, not just customers and PSUs on that side as well. Clearly, we're in a political advertising year as well and sometimes that's unclear how much of that is going to flow to you. But similar to what we've done in prior years, we'll always isolate that political advertising, so people have clarity around it so that they can isolate the growth rates in the good and in the bad. So we'll be doing that throughout the course of this year as well. So I don't think that, to put it bluntly, I don't think that a lower amount of rate increase really has a dramatic impact because of our improved ability to grow."

And the tension there is that there are some people that just are confused by new user interfaces and you have to manage that process and the customer education as well as the desire to get a highly functional UI out in front of everyone simultaneously. So we're still wrestling with the right rollout strategy. But operationally, it works very well, and it's capable of being fully deployed."

A lot of people focus on CP as being one of the big drivers and it is primarily because it's the easiest to model. So the drivers around that are -- once you've gone all-digital, you need less CPE per transaction. So just by going all-digital on a go-forward basis, you require less CPE for every gross add. The second element is that we're buying boxes at dramatically lower prices, well over 50% reduction from where we were buying that. And that's being driven by the introduction of Worldbox, but even the path to getting to Worldbox produce those type of prices for us. And by extending the license CPE through Spectrum Guide, that obviously has a big impact on capital intensity. The pieces that are, in some respects, even more material but harder to model include that the business is increasingly becoming more cloud-based. And by developing and putting platforms in the cloud as opposed to the local level, you can think of video-on-demand as just a one type of example. You can get better scale on any cable system by doing that and become more efficient from a capital perspective. Another area that's also harder to model is that today, when you take a look at TWC Charter and Bright House, 3 companies doing their own development and building and standing up of platforms, whether that's data centers or product development or IT platforms and that gets to be done in a single instance as opposed to 3 different times. So that there's a benefit to the transaction of putting these 3 companies together and being able to develop faster and at a cheaper cost per passing or per dollar of revenue. And the final one, I think, this is the one that's probably the most misunderstood, I think you're referencing the proxy statement that we had in the type [ph] CapEx forecast is, simply when you have higher revenue growth, then you should take a look at our results today. When you have higher revenue growth, you have a higher dollar value of revenue per passing in an environment where a good portion of your capital expenditure is fixed capital spend. And so simply by growing revenue faster, you can drop your capital intensity by having a better utilization of a fixed set of assets and a fixed capital cost. So that's the piece that I think that's the most misunderstood is in those proxy statements, which I'm not sitting here and reiterating today, although we were intelligent when we put them together, the reality is those CapEx dollars weren't decreasing, the capital intensity was declining significantly for all the reasons I mentioned. But a big driver of that is simply being able to drive higher revenue growth on a fixed set of passings."

We were going to invest more in service and we were going to invest more in every transaction by putting more equipment and gear into the home, and that's how we were going to make money, which is a little bit counterintuitive until you think about the fact by lowering the pricing on every single one of your product, you have the opportunity to sell more over time and get more revenue per household and get more efficient for all the reasons that we talked about. So we told people at the time that success would be defined by accelerating and not our customer relationship growth, better sell in to multiple products in the household, PSU growth as a result and then several quarters on you'd see a re-acceleration of the revenue growth, which would be stunted short term by putting in the high-value pricing and packaging. And then over time, you'd see EBITDA growth and reduction at capital intensity, all of which you've seen at Charter and it does provide the baseline model.

And so you could -- if one could comprise or build skinny bundles that work in the marketplace in a significant way, meaning customers adopted them, kept them and we're happy with them, you could still build packaged products that would make sense for consumers. So I don't think it has any direct impact on triple-play potential or any other bundled potential. That said, 96% of our customers are still expanded basic customers. So it's a -- the big package is still what most people take in our markets today. And if in fact programmers allow their content to be sold in skinny bundles, which I think would be very consumer-friendly, you could still build high-quality packages that would work in the marketplace in my opinion."

Almost all of our customer -- or the vast majority of our customers subscribe to us and over-the-top services. And we want our customers to be fully satisfied in their video experience and have that to be as seamless an experience as possible. And therefore, given the movement to on-demand programming and the volume -- the sheer volume of products available, you need to be able to search and find and discover products in a much more efficient way than people have historically stumbled on to television. And that's why we're building the UI. We're building -- and it's fully capable of doing cross-platform search. There are business issues around that, that we're working through, with parties, but it's what customers deserve. With regard to gross adds and the share where they're coming from, I'm not sure whether they're -- the economic or the macroeconomic situation has changed at all because growth rates in the country and for all MVPDs. We think that in our -- where we operate, our video share is about 50%. And so we think that we have a tremendous upside to grow our own business with the quality of video services that we can build and provide and with the service infrastructure we've built around that. I do think -- we talked about the macro issues previously and the pressures on video, most of which, I think, are economic, the costs have been high. It does look like costs have moderated a little bit on the margin, and that's partially because over-the-top is affecting the value of content in a good way from our perspective. And so I'm not -- we'll have to look at the macro trends, but in terms of what our growth opportunities are, our biggest growth opportunity is to take video share from existing providers, assuming that we had better products and services."

For some time now, we've been working to combine Charter Time Warner Cable and Bright House, while I'm very pleased with our progress towards closing and integration, I'm just as pleased with Charter's core operating performance. Our products, service, customer growth and financial results continue to improve as we deliver more value to our residential and business customers than ever before. Our operating and financial results show the potential growth trajectory that our new operating strategies will drive on a larger set of assets following the close of our transactions and the positive impact that we could have on those communities that will ultimately be served by Charter.
At the end of the first quarter, Charter had 6.8 million residential and SMB customers. Over the last 12 months, we've grown our total customer base by 6% with residential customer growth of 5% and small business customer growth of 18%. We continue to grow our video customer base in the first quarter. Total video customers grew by 15,000, including 10,000 residential video net adds and our all-digital video product enables HD and on-demand on every outlet. And we fully deployed our TBF for both mobile devices and media players for content delivery, both in and out of home. 
We recently launched our cloud-based EUI in St. Louis, in addition to Reno. It continues to scale well and is resonating with consumers. 
We also continue to grow our Internet business. Residential Internet customers grew by 9% over the last 12 months. During the first quarter, we added 141,000 Residential Internet customers. The strong demand that we're seeing for our Internet service is being driven by offering minimum 60 megabits speeds, quality service and consumer-friendly features, including unlimited data usage and no modem fees. 
Including voice, we added 186,000 PSUs in the first quarter, over 20% more than the 154,000 we added in the first quarter of 2015. 
We also continue to see improving commercial customer net additions with SMB PSU growth accelerating by 68% year-over-year in the first quarter. That customer growth improvement is being driven by the launch of new small business pricing and packaging in the first quarter of last year. 
We also launched new pricing and packaging for enterprise in the fourth quarter, including a deeper gigabit service offering that's driving a significant increase in sales. During the quarter, we grew our total revenue by 7.1% with even less reliance on rate increases. 
Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by over 10% year-over-year whether you include transition expenses or not. So EBITDA growth continues to exceed our revenue growth as it has for several quarters now as we take operating transactions out of the business through investing in our network, systems and people. 
We have a fully integrated operating strategy and business model, which is based on a clear centralized organizational structure, creating a superior product set package of highly competitive prices to sell more product. Unleashing the full capacity of our 2-way interactive network by going all-digital, insourcing service operations, people, cloud-based services and product platforms and continuous product development to stay ahead. As a result, the high level of growth that Charter can be sustainable for a long period of time. 
It's also an indication of what we believe we can do at Time Warner Cable and Bright House, that will require time and investments just as it did at Charter but I believe it can happen faster because of the relatively better starting condition of the assets we're acquiring. And we'll also benefit from transaction synergies to help offset the investments to achieve those operating synergies. I also believe our approach and track record here at Charter over the last several years will make the trends at new Charter easier for investors to understand over the next several years. 
So our customer growth and financial performance is very good as we had planned. Our sales are up and our residential churn is down. And in the first quarter, we saw 15% year-over-year reduction in billing and service calls as well as a 19% reduction in service truck roll volume. Our field service truck rolls are now 80% insources versus 50% in 2012 and it's increasing. And call center activity is now 90% insourced. In total, since the beginning of 2012, we've increased our workforce by over 7,000 people with the vast majority of the increase driven by insourcing. 
With our all-digital transition complete and secure 2-way boxes installed on every residential outlet, in April, we began to perform electronic disconnects instead of physical truck rolls. This change in practice also allows us to fully scale our self-install practices beyond what we did during all-digital. Electronic disconnects and self-installs will provide significant benefits to Charter systems in the coming years. It will also reduce operating cost and capital expenditures and raise customer satisfaction through greater control over the installation process and will also reduce the opportunity for self-service failure in a way that provide even better security.
Turning to the closing process with TWC and Bright House. On April 12, the administrative law judge, signed by the California PUC, reviewed our transactions recommended that our transactions be approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. We expect the PUC to vote on the judge's recommendation on May 12, all of our states have approved our transactions.
We're also pleased that the FCC Chairman has circulated an order approving our transactions and that the DOJ has filed a proposed judgment with the District Court under which our proposed transactions may precede. Assuming we receive FCC approval, we will expect to officially close our transactions within just a few days of receiving approval from the California PUC.
Next several months and quarters will be an exciting time for New Charter and after a lot of creative thought, we decided to call the new company, Charter. Our first priority is to get our people in the right roles and reporting structures with the right responsibilities. We've already announced Charter's organizational structure and leadership across the 3 organizations. 
Our corporate organization as well as marketing, sales and product development departments will be centralized over a period of 6 months following close. Our field operations group, which is the largest organization will be managed through 11 different regional areas. Each of those regions has been designed to represent a logical combination of designated marketing areas and these regions will be managed largely the same set of field employees with the 3 companies today. 
Following close, customer care will continue to be operated as a currently is in each of the 3 companies today. Over time, customer care will migrate to the Charter model of using virtualized you U.S.-based in-house call centers. This migration process is likely to take several years as it has here at Charter. 
A partial driver of the timing of our customer care transition is the pace of its IT and network operations integrations progress. Our goals with these integrations will be to minimize a service disruptions and to enable the business to deploy superior products and services.
Managing the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House will also be a key priority. At close, we will briefly paused any new digital rollouts at both companies and then restart them deploying fully enabled two-way set-top boxes everywhere and discontinuing DA deployments. Concurrent with all-digital, we'll introduce new product and pricing and packaging. We'll also launch our new pricing and packaging across those portions of TWC and BHN footprints that have already gone all-digital. We plan to complete all-digital and the launch of new pricing and packaging across all 36 million passings that TWC and Bright House by the end of 2018. 
In the historic Charter markets, we expect to make our cloud-based user available in most markets by the end of 2016. We're still working through our guide rollout plans for TWC and Bright House markets, that includes a coordinating guide rollouts with our market-by-market plans for all-digital and relaunch of new pricing and packaging. Ultimately, our goal is to offer our customers the significant guide to benefit as quickly as possible, if not at the cost of disruption to service operations of the customer. So we'll have more to report once we actually close and start running the businesses.
Our plans are in place and we're ready to go to work and we remain confident as ever about the benefits that our transaction will bring to our customers employees and our shareholders. I'd like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work and dedication to getting us where we are so far and to our financial stakeholders who continues to support us. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Chris to take you through the financials."

During the first quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 186,000 versus 154,000 last year. And in video, we added 10,000 residential customers versus a loss of 13,000 last year. In Residential Internet, we added 141,000 customers versus 125,000 last year and we grew residential voice customers by 35,000 versus 42,000 last year. 
Over the last year, our essential customer base has grown by 318,000, or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 1.4%, driven by a larger triple-play base and step-ups and modest rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet growth. 
As Slide 9 shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 6.5%. That compares to 6.7% last year as our faster customer growth offsets lower rate increases as designed. 
In commercial, we added 32,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year, that improvement follows the separation of our SMB and enterprise groups with new SMB pricing and packaging launched late last year. Total commercial revenue grew by approximately 12% and continues reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure we saw in residential when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in 2012.
Our advertising revenue was up about 9% year-over-year driven by a $5 million increase in political. 
In total, the first quarter revenue was up by 7.1% year-over-year and the same excluding advertising. 
Turning to first quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. Total operating expense grew by $85 million or 5.4% year-over-year, the transition OpEx accounting for $21 million of our total OpEx this quarter.
Programming expense grew by $37 million accounting for just under half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 5.5% increase in first quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our tiers and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers. Excluding the onetime expense benefit and the growth in our video customer base year-over-year, programming expense would have grown by 6%, flat, versus the prior year quarter.
Cost of service customers, which includes field operations, customer care, network operating costs declined slightly year-over-year, despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.9%, that ties directly to the operating metrics Tom highlighted and both consistent and improving relative to what we've seen for several quarters. 
Other costs grew by $34 million, or about 18% year-over-year, driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, including the insourcing of IT and software development resources and advertising and enterprise costs. Property taxes in previous CapEx and higher casualty claims due to more insourced employee base. Excluding a onetime nonrecurring expenses, this other expense category would have grown by 13% year-over-year. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA improved by over 10% year-over-year whether you include transition cost or not, and continue to exceed our revenue. As Tom mentioned, the continued growth of revenue capacity and operating improvement is in its early stage for Charter systems and has momentum. 
Moving to Slide 12. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $429 million or $53 million related to M&A transactions spend. That spending begin with the Comcast transaction and has provided us a head start to providing a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers beginning postclose. Excluding transition CapEx in both periods, our first quarter CapEx was up by just over $39 million, or 12%, driven primarily by our investments in product development and the end-year timing of the fleet purchases, which falls into the support capital line. For 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and the pending acquisitions, we expect our CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline at Charter year-over-year.
First quarter free cash flow was a negative $61 million and the year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher cash interest on our transaction-related debt and escrow. And from higher CapEx for the reasons I just outlined.
If you exclude the impact of our transaction, specifically, $21 million of our operating expense, $53 million of CapEx, $259 million of cash interest and escrow and $14 million of transaction costs and other expenses, our free cash flow, adjusted for the transaction spend, totaled approximately $280 million, that's up significantly versus last year on the same basis.
As of March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was 4.1x. The $21.8 billion of cash sitting in escrow for our transactions, plus term loan a commitments and combined liquidity at close, flee finances our transaction assuming TWC shareholders elect $100 cash option. At closing, we still expect to be levered at 4.5x or less on an LTM basis and assuming the first 12 months run rate synergies of approximately $500 million.
In February, we issued $1.7 billion of senior unsecured notes and in April, we issued an additional $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We intend to use the proceeds from these offerings to redeem Charter's currently callable outstanding higher price debt, although part of the proceeds from the February offer could be used to finance our transactions TWC shareholders were to elect to receive $115 per share in cash rather than $100.
Turning to the pending transactions. We expect the second quarter will be the first quarter for which we will report our results following close and I wanted to give you a brief preview on how we expect to report as mention a few things to better navigate our second quarter results. With an anticipated mid-quarter closing, our second quarter results will reflect a full quarter from legacy Charter, plus subpeers for TWC and Bright House, so year-over-year actual comparisons won't really be helpful but we will provide historical pro formas for the 3 companies under the historical management. We intend to present Charter's quarterly trending schedule with a pro forma data, along the lines of what do you received today, dating back to the beginning of 2014. Moving forward, we'll report similar customer, PSU and revenue data for Charter's 3 legacy entities for at least 5 quarters following close, both separately and, of course, under consolidated basis. This approach is going to allow you to track the development of each of the 3 legacy entities. 
We'll not show expenses or capital expenditures by legacy entity. It's not really practical given the shared nature of large key items like programming, overhead and significant centralized capital spend.
We'll also continue to report a transition expense and capital related to the integration and we'll provide updates in conference calls on certain items, including estimates for the synergies we've realia zed, so you can better isolated the organic growth of the business. We'll probably do that for about 2 years, beginning in the first full quarter of results. 
Our balance sheet and P&L will also be materially impacted by purchase price accounting and allocation. And part of that will be a significant fair market value a step-up of TWC and Bright House assets, reflecting the fair market value consideration we provide as of the closing dates. The step ups will primarily be in PNG, franchises, customer relationships and goodwill. I've heard none of the 3 companies assets will be step-up of our tax purposes. As a result of the difference between the stepped-up GAAP basis and the existing tax basis at TWC, there will be a significant increase to our deferred tax liability on our GAAP balance sheet. On a pro forma basis, it is already reflected in our S-4 and other filings, the GAAP basis step-up will also increase Charter's GAAP DNA charges above what the simple additional of historical DNA would be for the 3 legacy entities. 
Purchase price accounting will also likely result in the posting of an opening liability on the balance sheet to reflect an estimates of the outer market portion of TWC's distribution agreement with the Dodgers. They'll be no change of the TWC cash payments as a result of that accounting about the future P&L expense would be lower as a result.
We'll also modify the value at TWC's legacy do to it's a fair market value at closing. And the difference between the fair value at closing and the actual principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt, driving a difference between GAAP and cash interest expense. 
So those are some of the largest key items that will result from purchase accounting and there are a number of other key post closing items that are mentioned that will impact the consolidated financials. Our share count, which stands at approximately 112 million shares outstanding today will increase at close as we issues shares to TWC shareholders and to Liberty broadband. Given that Advance/Newhouse [indiscernible] anytime, it make sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as-exchange basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value and any Charter share-based metrics.
Also keep in mind that as part of the transaction, Charter will undergo what we refer to and explain more detail in our S-4 as the parent merger exchange. This transaction will essentially haircut the number of shares outstanding for the entire company for all shareholders, including Advance/Newhouse partnership unit by approximately 10%. 
The parent Merger exchange will be value neutral to all parties aggregate holdings in Charter but it will reduce the overall share counts of the company both on the shares outstanding basis and on an as-exchange basis, again, by about 10%.
In theory, new Charter's stock market price should reflect this reduction in shares with commensurate share price increase the New Charter stop against the trade on the NASDAQ. Slide 22 in the appendix of today's investor presentation should provide investors with a better understanding of Charter's share count and how the shares outstanding change for the parent merger exchange and the Advance/Newhouse unit on an as-exchange basis.
Moving on to some more post closing accounting and reporting housekeeping. At close, TWC employees who currently hold TWC stock awards will see no stock awards replace with New Charter stock awards which will mirror their current economics. The post closing vesting of these awards will increase stock compensation expense postclosing to reflect the updated fair value of these replacement stock awards as compared to their original brand value. We should also mention after closing substantially all of the $3 billion valuation allowance, which is posted against legacy Charter's deferred tax assets, is expected to be removed as the use of our NOLs will now be accelerated in Charter's consolidated tax return. 
The legacy Charter deferred tax asset account on the balance sheet today and net income in that quarter will both increased by approximately $3 billion as a onetime benefit. We'll also expense a quarterly charge of approximately $38 million in preferred coupon for Advance/Newhouse ownership of the preferred partnership units. That charge will be reported on separate line as noncontrolling interest expense.
We'll also have some transaction adviser expenses for both Charter and TWC, which are contingent closing already disclosed in the S-4 as well as commitments for our financing. And we expect below the line for structuring and termination expenses through the integration process that will post below the EBITDA line as well.
Finally, turning to our tax assets, as we indicated on our last call, we don't expect Charter to be a significant cash tax payer until 2018. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter. And when I refer to GAAP pretax income, we are excluding the impact of the pending purchase price accounting that we'll have on GAAP depreciation add more text expense going forward.
We do expect the transactions to trigger a change of ownership under Section 382 of the tax code. And while that change in ownership will again restrict the pace which NOLs will become available, we don't expect it to negatively impact the net present value of our tax assets at the last time as the transactions here will create a larger base of taxable income, ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus stand-alone Charter today. 
Operator, with that, we're ready for questions now."

No, that's not the right interpretation, although I'm glad that you as it because it should highlight for people. I was giving a commitment that we'll report that amount on a going backwards basis of how much is realized inside the quarter for 2 years. It could end up being longer depending on where we're actually at. I think when we said in the past is that we expect synergies to be over the course of 3 years to be fully baked into the actuals and there wasn't a change of I think I could be. So after 2 years, we've evaluate where we are, but give people clarity on how current reports the business in the upcoming 2 years at a minimum. On the active video JV that we have with Arris, it's a productive relationship that we have, both with the management team and ActiveVideo as well as Arris who runs 65%. We have a couple of board seat in that investment. We're treated as an independent third-party vendor inside of the relationship with ActiveVideo. So I guess, the benefit would be the ability to see what the pipeline of product that they have coming in the future and to have oversight in terms of how that's being developed elsewhere. But we saw an attractive product that we were using amongst other vendors in our Spectrum Guide platform and we thought it was an interesting equity investment, but also a strategic importance to Charter."

But that's really tied to the elimination of duplicative overhead programming and other transaction-related synergies of just putting the companies together, it's not a change in the operating strategies which is how you get additional profitability capacity over time.

We have been working on a pricing and packaging strategy that reduces activity all through the marketing process and the activation process of customers. It's designed to increase the life of subscriptions, so for the same dollars of revenue with longer customer life being less churn, same dollars of revenue, you have less cost per customer because you have less physical activity per dollar of revenue. And by maintaining our plant properly and by improving the quality of our craftsmanship by our employee base, which we've been hiring and training, we reduce service calls and that that further improves customer satisfaction, which improves subscriber life.

For some time now, we've been working to combine Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House. While I'm very pleased with our progress towards closing and integration, I'm just as pleased with Charter's core operating per",1470,"Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. For some time now, we've been working to combine Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House. While I'm very pleased with our progress towards closing and integration, I'm just as pleased with Charter's core operating performance. Our products, service, customer growth and financial results continue to improve as we deliver more value to our residential and business customers than ever before. Our operating and financial results show the potential growth trajectory that our new operating strategies will drive on a larger set of assets following the close of our transactions and the positive impact that we can have on those communities that will ultimately be served by Charter.
At the end of the first quarter, Charter had 6.8 million residential and SMB customers. Over the last 12 months, we've grown our total customer base by 6% with residential customer growth of 5% and small business customer growth of 18%. We continue to grow our video customer base in the first quarter. Total video customers grew by 15,000, including 10,000 residential video net adds and our all-digital video product enables HD and on-demand on every outlet. And we fully deployed our TBF for both mobile devices and media players for content delivery, both in and out of home. 
We recently launched our cloud-based EUI in St. Louis, in addition to Reno. It continues to scale well and is resonating with consumers. 
We also continue to grow our Internet business. Residential Internet customers grew by 9% over the last 12 months. During the first quarter, we added 141,000 Residential Internet customers. The strong demand that we're seeing for our Internet service is being driven by offering minimum 60 megabits speeds, quality service and consumer-friendly features, including unlimited data usage and no modem fees. 
Including voice, we added 186,000 PSUs in the first quarter, over 20% more than the 154,000 we added in the first quarter of 2015. 
We also continue to see improving commercial customer net additions, with SMB PSU growth accelerating by 68% year-over-year in the first quarter. That customer growth improvement is being driven by the launch of new small business pricing and packaging in the first quarter of last year. 
We also launched new pricing and packaging for enterprise in the fourth quarter, including a deeper gigabit service offering that's driving a significant increase in sales. During the quarter, we grew our total revenue by 7.1% with even less reliance on rate increases. 
Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by over 10% year-over-year whether you include transition expenses or not. So EBITDA growth continues to exceed our revenue growth as it has for several quarters now as we take operating transactions out of the business through investing in our network, systems and people. 
We have a fully integrated operating strategy and business model, which is based on a clear centralized organizational structure, creating a superior product set packaged at highly competitive prices to sell more product. Unleashing the full capacity of our 2-way interactive network by going all-digital, insourcing service operations, people, cloud-based services and product platforms and continuous product development to stay ahead. As a result, the higher level of growth that Charter can be sustainable for a long period of time. 
It's also an indication of what we believe we can do at Time Warner Cable and Bright House, that will require time and investment just as it did at Charter, but I believe it can happen faster because of the relatively better starting condition of the assets we're acquiring. And we'll also benefit from transaction synergies to help offset the investments to achieve those operating synergies. I also believe our approach and track record here at Charter over the last several years will make the trends at new Charter easier for investors to understand over the next several years. 
So our customer growth and financial performance is very good as we had planned. Our sales are up and our residential churn is down. And in the first quarter, we saw 15% year-over-year reduction in billing and service calls as well as a 19% reduction in service truck roll volume. Our field service truck rolls are now 80% insources versus 50% in 2012 and it's increasing. And call center activity is now 90% insourced. In total, since the beginning of 2012, we've increased our workforce by over 7,000 people, with the vast majority of the increase driven by insourcing. 
With our all-digital transition complete and secure 2-way boxes installed on every residential outlet, in April, we began to perform electronic disconnects instead of physical truck rolls. This change in practice also allows us to fully scale our self-install practices beyond what we did during all-digital. Electronic disconnects and self-installs will provide significant benefits to Charter systems in the coming years. It will also reduce operating cost and capital expenditures and raise customer satisfaction through greater control over the installation process and we'll also reduce the opportunity for self-service failure in a way that provide even better security.
Turning to the closing process with TWC and Bright House. On April 12, the administrative law judge, assigned by the California PUC to review our transactions recommended that our transactions be approved by the California Public Utility Commission. We expect the CPUC to vote on the judge's recommendation on May 12, all of our states have approved our transactions.
We're also pleased that the FCC Chairman has circulated an order approving our transactions and that the DOJ has filed a proposed judgment with the District Court under which our proposed transactions may precede. Assuming we receive FCC approval, we will expect to officially close our transactions within just a few days of receiving approval from the California PUC.
Next several months and quarters will be an exciting time for New Charter and after a lot of creative thought, we decided to call the new company, Charter. Our first priority is to get our people in the right roles and reporting structures with the right responsibilities. We've already announced Charter's organizational structure and leadership across the 3 organizations. 
Our corporate organization as well as marketing, sales and product development departments will be centralized over a period of 6 months following close. Our field operations group, which is the largest organization will be managed through 11 different regional areas. Each of those regions has been designed to represent a logical combination of designated marketing areas and these regions will be managed largely the same set of field employees that are with the 3 companies today. 
Following close, customer care will continue to be operated as it currently is in each of the 3 companies today. Over time, customer care will migrate to the Charter model of using virtualized U.S.-based, in-house call centers. This migration process is likely to take several years as it has here at Charter. 
A partial driver of the timing of our customer care transition is the pace at which our IT and network operations integrations progress. Our goals with these integrations will be to minimize service disruptions and to enable the business to deploy superior products and services.
Managing the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House will also be a key priority. At close, we will briefly pause any new digital rollouts at both companies and then restart them deploying fully enabled two-way set-top boxes everywhere and discontinuing D to A deployments. Concurrent with all-digital, we'll introduce new product and pricing and packaging. We'll also launch our new pricing and packaging across those portions of TWC and BHN footprints that have already gone all-digital. We plan to complete all-digital and the launch of new pricing and packaging across all 36 million passings that TWC and Bright House by the end of 2018. 
In the historic Charter markets, we expect to make our cloud-based user interface available in most markets by the end of 2016. We're still working through our guide rollout plans for TWC and Bright House markets, that includes a coordinating guide rollouts with our market-by-market plans for all-digital and relaunch of new pricing and packaging. Ultimately, our goal is to offer our customers the significant guide benefit as quickly as possible, if not at the cost of disruption to service operations of the customer. So I'll have more to report on once we actually close and start running the businesses.
Our plans are in place and we're ready to go to work, and we remain confident as ever about the benefits that our transaction will bring to our customers, employees and our shareholders. I'd like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work and dedication to getting us where we are so far and to our financial stakeholders who have continued to support us. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Chris to take you through the financials."

And in video, we added 10,000 residential customers versus a loss of 13,000 last year. In Residential Inter",2061,"Thanks, Tom. Starting with Slide 7 of today's presentation. During the first quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 186,000 versus 154,000 last year. And in video, we added 10,000 residential customers versus a loss of 13,000 last year. In Residential Internet, we added 141,000 customers versus 125,000 last year and we grew residential voice customers by 35,000 versus 42,000 last year. 
Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 318,000, or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 1.4%, driven by a larger triple-play base and step-ups and modest rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet growth. 
As Slide 9 shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 6.5%. That compares to 6.7% last year as our faster customer growth offsets lower rate increases as designed.
In commercial, we added 32,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year, that improvement follows the separation of our SMB and enterprise groups, with new SMB pricing and packaging launched late last year. Total commercial revenue grew by approximately 12% and continues to reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure we saw in residential, when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in 2012.
Our advertising revenue was up about 9% year-over-year driven by a $5 million increase in political. In total, the first quarter revenue was up by 7.1% year-over-year and the same when excluding advertising. 
Turning to first quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. Total operating expense grew by $85 million or 5.4% year-over-year, the transition OpEx accounting for $21 million of our total OpEx this quarter.
Programming expense grew by $37 million accounting for just under half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 5.5% increase in first quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our tiers and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers. Excluding the onetime expense benefit and the growth in our video customer base year-over-year, programming expense would have grown by 6% flat versus the prior year quarter.
Cost of service customers, which includes field operations, customer care, network operating cost declined slightly year-over-year, despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.9%, that ties directly to the operating metrics Tom highlighted and is both consistent and improving relative to what we've seen for several quarters. 
Other costs grew by $34 million, or about 18% year-over-year, driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, including the insourcing of IT and software development resources and advertising and enterprise cost. Property taxes on previous CapEx and the higher casualty claims due to a more insourced employee base. Excluding a onetime nonrecurring expense, this other expense category would have grown by 13% year-over-year. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by over 10% year-over-year, whether you include transition cost or not, and continued to exceed our revenue growth. As Tom mentioned, the continued growth of revenue per capacity and operating improvement is at an early stage for Charter systems and has momentum. 
Moving to Slide 12. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $429 million or $53 million related to M&A transaction spend. That spending began with the Comcast transactions and has provided us a head start to providing a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers beginning post-close. 
Excluding transition CapEx in both periods, our first quarter CapEx was up by just over $39 million, or 12%, driven primarily by our investments in product development and the end-year timing of the fleet purchases, which falls into the support capital line. For 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and the pending acquisitions, we expect our CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline at Charter year-over-year.
First quarter free cash flow was negative $61 million and the year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher cash interest on our transactions-related debt and escrow, and from higher CapEx for the reasons I just outlined.
If you exclude the impact of our transaction, specifically, $21 million of operating expense, $53 million of CapEx, $259 million of cash interest in escrow and $14 million of transaction costs and other expenses, our free cash flow adjusted for transaction spend, totaled approximately $280 million, that's up significantly versus last year on the same basis.
As of March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was 4.1x. The $21.8 billion of cash sitting in escrow for our transactions, plus Term Loan A commitments and our combined liquidity at close, fully finances our transactions assuming TWC shareholders elect the $100 cash option. At closing, we still expect to be levered at 4.5x or less on an LTM basis and assuming the first 12 months run rate synergies of approximately $500 million.
In February, we issued $1.7 billion of senior unsecured notes and in April, we issued an additional $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We intend to use the proceeds from these offerings to redeem Charter's currently callable outstanding higher price debt, although part of the proceeds from the February offer could be used to finance our transactions if some of the TWC shareholders were to elect to receive the $115 per share in cash rather than $100.
Turning to the pending transactions. We expect the second quarter will be the first quarter for which we will report our results following close, and I wanted to give you a brief preview on how we expect to report and to mention a few things to better navigate our second quarter results. 
With an anticipated mid-quarter closing, our second quarter results will reflect a full quarter from legacy Charter, plus stub periods for TWC and Bright House, so year-over-year actual comparisons won't really be helpful, but we will provide historical pro formas for the 3 companies under the historical management. We intend to present Charter's quarterly trending schedule with pro forma data, along the lines of what you received today, dating back to the beginning of 2014. 
Moving forward, we'll report similar customer, PSU and revenue data for Charter's 3 legacy entities for at least 5 quarters following close, both separately and, of course, under consolidated basis. This approach is going to allow you to track the development of each of the 3 legacy entities. 
We'll not show expenses or capital expenditures by legacy entity. It's not really practical, given the shared nature of large key items like programming, overhead and significant centralized capital spend.
We'll also continue to report transition expense and capital related to the integration and we'll provide updates in conference calls on certain items, including estimates for the synergies we've realized, so you can better isolate the organic growth of the business. We'll probably do that for about 2 years, beginning in the first full quarter of results. 
Our balance sheet and P&L will also be materially impacted by purchase price accounting and allocation. And part of that will be a significant fair market value step-up of TWC and Bright House assets, reflecting the fair market value of the consideration we provide as of the closing dates. The step-ups will primarily be in PNG, franchises, customer relationships and goodwill. I've heard none of the 3 companies' assets will be stepped-up for s   our tax purposes. As a result of the difference between the stepped-up GAAP basis and the existing tax basis at TWC, there will be a significant increase to our deferred tax liability on our GAAP balance sheet. On a pro forma basis, and as already reflected in our S-4 and other filings, the GAAP basis step-up will also increase Charter's GAAP DNA charges above what the simple addition of historical DNA would be for the 3 legacy entities. 
Purchase price accounting will also likely result in the posting of an opening liability on the balance sheet to reflect an estimate of the out-of-market portion of TWC's RSN distribution agreement with the Dodgers. There would be no change to the TWC cash payments as a result of that accounting, but future P&L expense would be lower as a result.
We'll also modify the value of TWC's legacy debt to it's a fair market value at closing. And the difference between the fair value at closing and the actual principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt, driving a difference between GAAP and cash interest expense. 
So those are some of the largest key items that will result from purchase accounting, but there are a number of other key post-closing items that are mentioned that will impact the consolidated financials. Our share count, which stands at approximately 112 million shares outstanding today will increase at close as we issue shares to TWC shareholders and to Liberty Broadband. Given that Advance/Newhouse partnership units are exchangeable at anytime, it makes sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as-exchange basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value and any Charter share-based metrics.
Also keep in mind that as part of the transactions, Charter will undergo what we refer to and explain in more detail in our S-4 as the parent merger exchange. This transaction will essentially haircut the number of shares outstanding for the entire company for all shareholders, including Advance/Newhouse partnership units by approximately 10%. 
The parent Merger exchange will be value-neutral to all parties aggregate holdings in Charter, but it will reduce the overall share count of the company both on a shares outstanding basis and on an as-exchange basis, again, by about 10%.
In theory, New Charter stock market price should reflect this reduction in shares with commensurate share price increase on the day New Charter stock begins to trade on the NASDAQ. Slide 22 in the appendix of today's investor presentation should provide investors with a better understanding of Charter's share count and how the shares outstanding change for the parent merger exchange and the Advance/Newhouse unit on an as-exchange basis.
Moving on to some more post-closing, accounting and reporting housekeeping. At close, TWC employees who currently hold TWC stock awards will see those stock awards replaced with New Charter stock awards, which will mirror their current economics. The post closing vesting of these awards will increase stock compensation expense post-closing to reflect the updated fair value of these replacement stock awards as compared to their original grant value. We should also mention that after closing substantially all of the $3 billion valuation allowance, which is posted against legacy Charter's deferred tax assets, is expected to be removed as the use of our NOLs will now be accelerated in Charter's consolidated tax return. 
The legacy Charter deferred tax asset account on the balance sheet today and net income in that quarter were both increased by approximately $3 billion as a onetime benefit. We'll also expense a quarterly charge of approximately $38 million in preferred coupon for Advance/Newhouse's ownership of preferred partnership units. That charge will be reported on a separate line as noncontrolling interest expense.
We'll also have some transaction adviser expenses for both Charter and TWC, which are contingent and payable closing, already disclosed in the S-4 as well as the commitment and placement fees for our financing. And we expect below the line restructuring and termination expenses through the integration process that will post below the EBITDA line as well.
Finally, turning to our tax assets, as we indicated on our last call, we don't expect Charter to be a significant cash tax payer until 2018. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter. And when I refer to GAAP pretax income, we are excluding the impact of the pending purchase price accounting that we'll have on GAAP depreciation and amortization expense going forward.
We do expect the transactions to trigger a change of ownership under Section 382 of the tax code. And while that change in ownership will again restrict the pace at which NOLs will become available, I don't expect it to negatively impact the net present value of our tax assets similar to last time, as the transactions here will create a larger base of taxable income, ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus standalone Charter today. 
Operator, with that, we're ready for questions now."

I was giving a commitment that we'll report that amount on a going backwards basis of how much is realized inside the quarter for 2 years. It could end up being longer depending on where we're actually at. I think what we said in the past is that we expect synergies could be over the course of 3 years to be fully baked into the actuals and there wasn't a change of where I think I could be. So after 2 years, we'll evaluate where we are, but I wanted to give people some clarity about how we were going to report the business in the upcoming 2 years at a minimum. On the ActiveVideo JV that we have with Arris, it's a productive relationship that we have, both with the management team and ActiveVideo as well as Arris who runs 65%. We have a couple of board seats on that investment. We're treated as an independent third-party vendor inside the relationship with ActiveVideo. So I guess, the benefit would be the ability to see what the pipeline of product that they have coming in the future and to have oversight in terms of how that's being developed elsewhere. But we saw an attractive product that we were using amongst other vendors in our Spectrum Guide platform and we thought it was an interesting equity investment, but also a strategic importance to Charter."

So the transaction synergies, we're not giving an update on our thoughts around that other than we think that it was -- other than to say that we always thought it was conservative. We still do. But that's really tied to the elimination of duplicate overhead programming and other transaction-related synergies of just putting the companies together, it's not a change in the operating strategies, which is how you get additional profitability per capacity over time. So one can argue and say, well, the synergies are obviously, much, much higher than the $800 million, and I would agree with that.

We have been working on a pricing and packaging strategy that reduces activity all through the marketing process and the activation process of customers. It's designed to increase the life of subscriptions, so for the same dollars of revenue with longer customer life meaning less churn, same dollars of revenue, you have less cost per customer because you have less physical activity per dollar of revenue. And by maintaining our plant properly and by improving the quality of our craftsmanship by our employee base, which we've been hiring and training, we reduce service calls and that further improves customer satisfaction, which improves subscriber life.

They've been going to market over the past year, 1.5 years, with a pretty similar triple-play, but they still have a very different a box or equipment pricing model and that's one of the areas that we're going to have work through new pricing and packaging to put that into the Charter format so that you can have longer-term growth with lower amount of equipment rental and in some cases, no equipment rental in the case of modem fees and so that thus make a difference and it's pretty similar to Time Warner Cable and Bright House.

For some time now, we've been working to combine Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House. While I'm very pleased with our progress towards closing and integration, I'm just as pleased with Charter's core operating per",1469,"Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. For some time now, we've been working to combine Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House. While I'm very pleased with our progress towards closing and integration, I'm just as pleased with Charter's core operating performance. Our products, service, customer growth and financial results continue to improve as we deliver more value to our residential and business customers than ever before. Our operating and financial results show the potential growth trajectory that our new operating strategies will drive on a larger set of assets following the close of our transactions and the positive impact that we can have on those communities that will ultimately be served by Charter.
At the end of the first quarter, Charter had 6.8 million residential and SMB customers. Over the last 12 months, we've grown our total customer base by 6% with residential customer growth of 5% and small business customer growth of 18%. We continue to grow our video customer base in the first quarter. Total video customers grew by 15,000, including 10,000 residential video net adds and our all-digital video product enables HD and on-demand on every outlet. And we fully deployed our TV app for both mobile devices and media players for content delivery, both in and out of home. 
We recently launched our cloud-based EUI in St. Louis, in addition to Reno. It continues to scale well and is resonating with consumers. 
We also continue to grow our Internet business. Residential Internet customers grew by 9% over the last 12 months. During the first quarter, we added 141,000 Residential Internet customers. The strong demand that we're seeing for our Internet service is being driven by offering minimum 60 megabits speeds, quality service and consumer-friendly features, including unlimited data usage and no modem fees. 
Including voice, we added 186,000 PSUs in the first quarter, over 20% more than the 154,000 we added in the first quarter of 2015. 
We also continue to see improving commercial customer net additions, with SMB PSU growth accelerating by 68% year-over-year in the first quarter. That customer growth improvement is being driven by the launch of new small business pricing and packaging in the first quarter of last year. 
We also launched new pricing and packaging for enterprise in the fourth quarter, including a deeper gigabit service offering that's driving a significant increase in sales. During the quarter, we grew our total revenue by 7.1% with even less reliance on rate increases. 
Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by over 10% year-over-year whether you include transition expenses or not. So EBITDA growth continues to exceed our revenue growth as it has for several quarters now as we take operating transactions out of the business through investing in our network, systems and people. 
We have a fully integrated operating strategy and business model, which is based on a clear centralized organizational structure, creating a superior product set packaged at highly competitive prices to sell more product. Unleashing the full capacity of our 2-way interactive network by going all-digital, insourcing service operations, people, cloud-based services and product platforms and continuous product development to stay ahead. As a result, the higher level of growth at Charter can be sustainable for a long period of time. 
It's also an indication of what we believe we can do at Time Warner Cable and Bright House. That will require time and investment just as it did at Charter, but I believe it can happen faster because of the relatively better starting condition of the assets we're acquiring. And we'll also benefit from transaction synergies to help offset the investments to achieve those operating synergies. I also believe our approach and track record here at Charter over the last several years will make the trends at new Charter easier for investors to understand over the next several years. 
So our customer growth and financial performance is very good, as we had planned. Our sales are up and our residential churn is down. And in the first quarter, we saw 15% year-over-year reduction in billing and service calls as well as a 19% reduction in service truck roll volume. Our field service truck rolls are now 80% insources versus 50% in 2012 and it's increasing. And call center activity is now 90% insourced. In total, since the beginning of 2012, we've increased our workforce by over 7,000 people, with the vast majority of the increase driven by insourcing. 
With our all-digital transition complete and secure 2-way boxes installed on every residential outlet, in April, we began to perform electronic disconnects instead of physical truck rolls. This change in practice also allows us to fully scale our self-install practices beyond what we did during all-digital. Electronic disconnects and self-installs will provide significant benefits to Charter systems in the coming years. It will also reduce operating cost and capital expenditures and raise customer satisfaction through greater control over the installation process and will also reduce the opportunity for self-service failure in a way that provide even better security.
Turning to the closing process with TWC and Bright House. On April 12, the administrative law judge, assigned by the California PUC to review our transactions recommended that our transactions be approved by the California Public Utility Commission. We expect the CPUC to vote on the judge's recommendation on May 12, all other states have approved our transactions.
We're also pleased that the FCC Chairman has circulated an order approving our transactions and that the DOJ has filed a proposed judgment with the District Court under which our proposed transactions may precede. Assuming we receive FCC approval, we would expect to officially close our transactions within just a few days of receiving approval from the California PUC.
Next several months and quarters will be an exciting time for New Charter and after a lot of creative thought, we decided to call the new company, Charter. Our first priority is to get our people in the right roles and reporting structures with the right responsibilities. We've already announced Charter's organizational structure and leadership across the 3 organizations. 
Our corporate organization as well as marketing, sales and product development departments will be centralized over a period of 6 months following close. Our field operations group, which is the largest organization will be managed through 11 different regional areas. Each of those regions has been designed to represent a logical combination of designated marketing areas and these regions will be managed with largely the same set of field employees that are with the 3 companies today. 
Following close, customer care will continue to be operated as it currently is at each of the 3 companies today. Over time, customer care will migrate to the Charter model of using virtualized U.S.-based, in-house call centers. This migration process is likely to take several years as it has here at Charter. 
A partial driver of the timing of our customer care transition is the pace at which our IT and network operations integrations progress. Our goals with these integrations will be to minimize service disruptions and to enable the business to deploy superior products and services.
Managing the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House will also be a key priority. At close, we will briefly pause any new digital rollouts at both companies and then restart them deploying fully enabled two-way set-top boxes everywhere and discontinuing D to A deployments. Concurrent with all-digital, we'll introduce new product and pricing and packaging. We'll also launch our new pricing and packaging across those portions of TWC and BHN footprints that have already gone all-digital. We plan to complete all-digital and the launch of new pricing and packaging across all 36 million passings at TWC and Bright House by the end of 2018. 
In historic Charter markets, we expect to make our cloud-based user interface available in most markets by the end of 2016. We're still working through our guide rollout plans for TWC and Bright House markets, that includes coordinating guide rollouts with our market-by-market plans for all-digital and relaunch of new pricing and packaging. Ultimately, our goal is to offer our customers the significant guide benefit as quickly as possible, if not at the cost of disruption to service operations of the customer. So I'll have more to report on once we actually close and start running the businesses.
Our plans are in place and we're ready to go to work, and we remain confident as ever about the benefits that our transaction will bring to our customers, employees and our shareholders. I'd like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work and dedication to getting us where we are so far and to our financial stakeholders who have continued to support us. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Chris to take you through the financials."

Starting with Slide 7 of today's presentation. During the first quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 186,000 versus 154,000 last year. And in video, we added 10,000 residential customers versus a loss of 13,000 last year. In Residential Inter",2059,"Thanks, Tom. Starting with Slide 7 of today's presentation. During the first quarter, we grew residential PSUs by 186,000 versus 154,000 last year. And in video, we added 10,000 residential customers versus a loss of 13,000 last year. In Residential Internet, we added 141,000 customers versus 125,000 last year and we grew residential voice customers by 35,000 versus 42,000 last year. 
Over the last year, our residential customer base has grown by 318,000, or by 5%. And over the same period, residential ARPU was up by 1.4%, driven by a larger triple-play base and step-ups and modest rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet growth. 
As Slide 9 shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year residential revenue growth of 6.5%. That compares to 6.7% last year as our faster customer growth offsets lower rate increases as designed.
In commercial, we added 32,000 SMB PSUs versus 19,000 in the prior year, that improvement follows the separation of our SMB and enterprise groups, with new SMB pricing and packaging launched late last year. Total commercial revenue grew by approximately 12% and continues to reflect the same short-term ARPU pressure we saw in residential, when we initially launched our new pricing and packaging in 2012.
Our advertising revenue was up about 9% year-over-year driven by a $5 million increase in political. In total, the first quarter revenue was up by 7.1% year-over-year and the same when excluding advertising. 
Turning to first quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. Total operating expense grew by $85 million or 5.4% year-over-year, the transition OpEx accounting for $21 million of our total OpEx this quarter.
Programming expense grew by $37 million accounting for just under half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense. The 5.5% increase in first quarter programming was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in our video customer base over the last year, higher penetration of our tiers and the launch of new channels, including the Dodgers. Excluding the onetime expense benefit and the growth in our video customer base year-over-year, programming expense would have grown by 6% flat versus the prior year quarter.
Cost of service customers, which includes field operations, customer care, network operating cost declined slightly year-over-year, despite residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.9%, that ties directly to the operating metrics Tom highlighted and is both consistent and improving relative to what we've seen for several quarters. 
Other costs grew by $34 million, or about 18% year-over-year, driven by some additional corporate and administrative labor expense, including the insourcing of IT and software development resources and advertising and enterprise cost. Property taxes on previous CapEx and the higher casualty claims due to a more insourced employee base. Excluding a onetime nonrecurring expense, this other expense category would have grown by 13% year-over-year. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by over 10% year-over-year, whether you include transition cost or not, and continued to exceed our revenue growth. As Tom mentioned, the continued growth of revenue per passing and [ph] operating improvement is at an early stage for Charter systems and has momentum. 
Moving to Slide 12. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $429 million with $53 million related to M&A transaction spend. That spending began with the Comcast transactions and has provided us a head start to providing a uniform product and service package to TWC and Bright House customers beginning post-close. 
Excluding transition CapEx in both periods, our first quarter CapEx was up by just over $39 million, or 12%, driven primarily by our investments in product development and the end-year timing of the fleet purchases, which falls into the support capital line. For 2016, excluding the impact of transition CapEx and the pending acquisitions, we expect our CapEx as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline at Charter year-over-year.
First quarter free cash flow was negative $61 million and the year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher cash interest on our transactions-related debt and escrow, and from higher CapEx for the reasons I just outlined.
If you exclude the impact of our transaction, specifically, $21 million of operating expense, $53 million of CapEx, $259 million of cash interest in escrow and $14 million of transaction costs and other expenses, our free cash flow adjusted for transaction spend, totaled approximately $280 million, that's up significantly versus last year on the same basis.
As of March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was 4.1x. The $21.8 billion of cash sitting in escrow for our transactions, plus Term Loan A commitments and our combined liquidity at close, fully finances our transactions assuming TWC shareholders elect the $100 cash option. At closing, we still expect to be levered at 4.5x or less on an LTM basis and assuming the first 12 month run rate synergies of approximately $500 million.
In February, we issued $1.7 billion of senior unsecured notes and in April, we issued an additional $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We intend to use the proceeds from these offerings to redeem Charter's currently callable outstanding higher price debt, although part of the proceeds from the February offer could be used to finance our transactions if some of the TWC shareholders were to elect to receive $115 per share in cash rather than $100.
Turning to the pending transactions. We expect the second quarter will be the first quarter for which we will report our results following close, and I wanted to give you a brief preview on how we expect to report and to mention a few things to better navigate our second quarter results. 
With an anticipated mid-quarter closing, our second quarter results will reflect a full quarter from legacy Charter, plus stub periods for TWC and Bright House, so year-over-year actual comparisons won't really be helpful, but we will provide historical pro formas for the 3 companies under their historical management. We intend to present Charter's quarterly trending schedule with pro forma data, along the lines of what you received today, dating back to the beginning of 2014. 
Moving forward, we'll report similar customer, PSU and revenue data for Charter's 3 legacy entities for at least 5 quarters following close, both separately and, of course, under consolidated basis. This approach is going to allow you to track the development of each of the 3 legacy entities. 
We'll not show expenses or capital expenditures by legacy entity. It's not really practical, given the shared nature of large key items like programming, overhead and significant centralized capital spend.
We'll also continue to report transition expense and capital related to the integration and we'll provide updates in conference calls on certain items, including estimates for the synergies we've realized, so you can better isolate the organic growth of the business. We'll probably do that for about 2 years, beginning in the first full quarter of results. 
Our balance sheet and P&L will also be materially impacted by purchase price accounting and allocation. And part of that will be a significant fair market value step-up of TWC and Bright House assets, reflecting the fair market value of the consideration we provide as of the closing dates. The step-ups will primarily be in PP&E, franchises, customer relationships and goodwill. However none of the 3 companies' assets will be stepped-up for tax purposes. As a result of the difference between the stepped-up GAAP basis and the existing tax basis at TWC, there will be a significant increase to our deferred tax liability on our GAAP balance sheet. On a pro forma basis, and as already reflected in our S-4 and other filings, the GAAP basis step-up will also increase Charter's GAAP DNA charges above what the simple addition of historical DNA would be for the 3 legacy entities. 
Purchase price accounting will also likely result in the posting of an opening liability on the balance sheet to reflect an estimate of the out-of-market portion of TWC's RSN distribution agreement with the Dodgers. There will be no change to the TWC cash payments as a result of that accounting, but future P&L expense would be lower as a result.
We'll also modify the value of TWC's legacy debt to its fair market value at closing. And the difference between the fair value at closing and the actual principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt, driving a difference between GAAP and cash interest expense. 
So those are some of the largest key items that will result from purchase accounting, but there are a number of other key post-closing items that I'll mention that will impact the consolidated financials. Our share count, which stands at approximately 112 million shares outstanding today will increase at close as we issue shares to TWC shareholders and to Liberty Broadband. Given that Advance/Newhouse partnership units are exchangeable at anytime, it makes sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as-exchanged basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value and any Charter share-based metrics.
Also keep in mind that as part of the transactions, Charter will undergo what we refer to and explain in more detail in our S-4 as the parent merger exchange. This transaction will essentially haircut the number of shares outstanding for the entire company for all shareholders, including Advance/Newhouse partnership units by approximately 10%. 
The parent merger exchange will be value-neutral to all party's aggregate holdings in Charter, but it will reduce the overall share count of the company both on a shares outstanding basis and on an as-exchanged basis, again, by about 10%.
In theory, New Charter stock market price should reflect this reduction in shares with commensurate share price increase on the day New Charter stock begins to trade on the NASDAQ. Slide 22 in the appendix of today's investor presentation should provide investors with a better understanding of Charter's share count and how the shares outstanding change for the parent merger exchange and the Advance/Newhouse unit on an as-exchanged basis.
Moving on to some more post-closing, accounting and reporting housekeeping. At close, TWC employees who currently hold TWC stock awards will see those stock awards replaced with New Charter stock awards, which will mirror their current economics. The post closing vesting of these awards will increase stock compensation expense post-closing to reflect the updated fair value of these replacement stock awards as compared to their original grant value. We should also mention that after closing substantially all of the $3 billion valuation allowance, which is posted against legacy Charter's deferred tax assets, is expected to be removed as the use of our NOLs will now be accelerated in Charter's consolidated tax return. 
The legacy Charter deferred tax asset account on the balance sheet today and net income in that quarter were both increased by approximately $3 billion as a onetime benefit. We'll also expense a quarterly charge of approximately $38 million in preferred coupon for Advance/Newhouse's ownership of preferred partnership units. That charge will be reported on a separate line as noncontrolling interest expense.
We'll also have some transaction adviser expenses for both Charter and TWC, which are contingent and payable at closing, already disclosed in the S-4 as well as the commitment and placement fees for our financing. And we expect below the line restructuring and termination expenses through the integration process that will post below the EBITDA line as well.
Finally, turning to our tax assets, as we indicated on our last call, we don't expect Charter to be a significant cash tax payer until 2018. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter. And when I refer to GAAP pretax income, we are excluding the impact of the pending purchase price accounting that we'll have on GAAP depreciation and amortization expense going forward.
We do expect the transactions to trigger a change of ownership under Section 382 of the tax code. And while that change in ownership will again restrict the pace at which our NOLs will become available, I don't expect it to negatively impact the net present value of our tax assets similar to last time, as the transactions here will create a larger base of taxable income, ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus standalone Charter today.

I was giving a commitment that we'll report that amount on a going backwards basis of how much is realized inside the quarter for 2 years. It could end up being longer depending on where we're actually at. I think what we've said in the past is that we expect synergies could be over the course of 3 years to be fully baked into the actuals and there wasn't a change of where I think I could be. So after 2 years, we'll evaluate where we are, but I wanted to give people some clarity about how we were going to report the business in the upcoming 2 years at a minimum. On the ActiveVideo JV that we have with Arris, it's a productive relationship that we have, both with the management team and ActiveVideo as well as Arris who owns 65%. We have a couple of board seats on that investment. We're treated as an independent third-party vendor inside the relationship with ActiveVideo. So I guess, the benefit would be the ability to see what the pipeline of product that they have coming in the future and to have oversight in terms of how that's being developed elsewhere. But we saw an attractive product that we were using amongst other vendors in our Spectrum Guide platform and we thought it was an interesting equity investment, but also of strategic importance to Charter."

So the transaction synergies, we're not giving an update on our thoughts around that other than we think that it was -- other than to say that we always thought it was conservative. We still do. But that's really tied to the elimination of duplicate overhead programming and other transaction-related synergies of just putting the companies together, it's not a change in the operating strategies, which is how you get additional profitability per passing over time. So one can argue and say, well, the synergies are obviously, much, much higher than the $800 million, and I would agree with that.

We have been working on a pricing and packaging strategy that reduces activity all through the marketing process and the activation process of customers. It's designed to increase the life of subscriptions; so for the same dollars of revenue with longer customer life; meaning less churn -- same dollars of revenue, you have less cost per customer because you have less physical activity per dollar of revenue. And by maintaining our plant properly and by improving the quality of our craftsmanship by our employee base, which we've been hiring and training, we reduce service calls and that further improves customer satisfaction, which improves subscriber life.

The biggest one is just the amount of single, double and triple-play, which I think, we and TWC both disclose so you can work through the numbers there. They've been going to market over the past year, 1.5 years, with a pretty similar triple-play, but they still have a very different a box or equipment pricing model and that's one of the areas that we're going to have work through with new pricing and packaging to put that into the Charter format so that you can have longer-term growth with lower amount of equipment rental and in some cases, no equipment rental, in the case of modem: Fees. And so that thus make a difference and it's pretty similar at Time Warner Cable and Bright House. So there are structural differences in the ARPU and our goal would be to make sure that as we go through new pricing and packaging, that we actually don't hurt revenue along the way, but continue to grow it, both through subscriber volume and customer relationship volume as well as additional PSUs per household."

Well, the DOJ's consent decree is actually public. And they made comments in their release stating that there wasn't anything in our particular practices that was a concern of theirs, but it was more things they discovered in some of the Time Warner agreements. So our go-to-market strategy and our programming relationships are designed to encourage the sale of our existing products and the development of over-the-top products. Our broadband package and the capabilities of our broadband service are realized when customers use it. And they use it when they subscribe to over-the-top services. Video is the most bandwidth-intensive product there is. So we have a superior network, which we've invested to make superior, we've cleared it to create more Spectrum available for broadband, we've taken broadband speeds up and capabilities up. And the way that our drive into the marketplace is accelerated is by peoples perceiving the value of our broadband and the way they perceive that value is through over-the-top. So we can hold all those concepts in our head at the same time and go-to-market, and we do. We do think that the market is evolving and the price value of products are evolving. And we look to take advantage of that where we can using our scale and using our strategy with programmers and our relationships with programmers to be as efficient as possible."

19609,374153314,1030913,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. On May 18, we closed our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint giving us the local and national scale to innovate and grow faster",1050,"Thanks, Stefan. On May 18, we closed our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint giving us the local and national scale to innovate and grow faster. Our high-capacity network now reaches nearly 49 million homes and businesses and we have over 25 million residential and business customers in attractive markets. Our ability to use mass media effectively has increased from approximately 50% of passings at legacy Charter to the mid-90% range today. This gives us better local sales, marketing and branding capabilities, service delivery and field operations, efficiencies and a greater ability to reach and serve medium- and long-term -- excuse me, medium and large commercial customers. 
The new scale will accelerate video and advance advertising product development and deepen our wireless service offerings over time. There are also meaningful one-time transaction synergies which will prove higher than previously outlined. Nevertheless, the execution of Charter's high-growth customer-focused operating strategy across a larger service footprint remains the largest contributor to shareholder value in our plans. 
Since the close, we found what we thought we would and we put in place a single centralized operating and financial control structure. We're standardizing our business practices and processes, including the IT service infrastructure, which will be completed over the next 2-plus years, as well as our products, pricing and packaging across all of our regions over the next year. And finally, we'll continue to develop and launch new products and services, which position Charter for long-term growth. 
At closing, all of our employees were mapped to their respective business units and executives based on our operating model. Today, the bulk of our 90,000-plus employees remain in the field, inside our operating regions and call centers. 
We've already begun insourcing efforts for the new company. The process of insourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people, train them and equip them with trucks, tools and test equipment and house them in new and expanded facilities. That process has already started as we are building Charter's first Spanish-language call center in the Texas with approximately 600 seats. Ultimately, with a more local workforce, we'll perform higher quality transactions with customers, which we expect will improve customer satisfaction, reduce transactions and costs and extend average customer lines, thereby growing our customer base and cash flow efficiently. 
In the fall, we began to rebrand Time Warner Cable and Bright House and launch our Spectrum pricing and packaging in a number of key markets totaling over 40% of our acquired passings with the remainder in and the first half of 2017. On the small and medium business side, we'll launch full-spectrum small business product pricing and packaging in TWC and Bright House markets in early and mid-2017. 
In 2017, the all-digital project that Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets will use the Charter all-digital strategy, which uses fully functioning 2-way set-top boxes with Video On Demand and advanced guide functionality on every TV outlet. We expect the project to be completed by 2018. We will also extend our practice of performing electronic connections instead of physical truck rolls as we go all-digital, allowing us to fully scale our self-installation and self-service practices. 
Our plan is to have Spectrum Guide available in most legacy Charter markets by the end of this year. We will launch Spectrum Guide in TWC's larger markets by the middle of 2017 and other TWC and Bright House markets following through the year and likely continuing 2018 as we complete the all-digital project. 
Now that we're closed, we're running a WiFi network in public spaces throughout the country as well as on a widely distributed indoor terrestrial wireless network, which combined with MVNO opportunities and other wireless blocks, should allow us to create products and services with a high value proposition. Overtime, we'll have more to discuss on this subject. 
Chris will cover the second quarter results in more detail in a moment. But the overview is that, legacy Charter continue to perform very well in the quarter with better subscriber growth than the prior year. And on a stand-alone basis through closing, legacy Charter continued to show double-digit and improving EBITDA growth. Bright House also improved its customer performance year-over-year. While Bright House benefited from frontiers acquisition of certain FiOS properties, it should be noted that because most of its footprint is in Florida, it is subject to greater second quarter seasonality than both Charter and Time Warner Cable. 
Legacy Time Warner Cable is in better shape than just a couple of years ago with growth in customer relationships. During the second quarter last year, Time Warner had a very aggressive voice promotion making voice ned add comparisons with this third quarter negative. However, our second quarter pro forma results have to be seen in context because they reflect the continuation of previous operating strategies much of which are different from our plan. 
Through different metrics and stages of development, we can see that TWC and more recently, Bright House, have both become reliant on rate increases and retention offers, each of which has various short- and long-term effects, including encouraging customers to initiate more transactions. We've addressed these types of issues at legacy Charter and we'll do so at TWC and Bright House during the Spectrum and packaging migration. 
Generally though, we're very pleased with how TWC and Bright House managed the assets through closing. Our pro forma total customer relationships increased by 173,000 during the second quarter compared to 54,000 last year and our year-over-year pro forma revenue growth of 6.6% and pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% in Q2 demonstrates the health of our business. We will make the necessary investments in using the same approach we used at Charter to put the new assets on the right long-term growth strategy. The big difference today is that we have an established management team with experience running our operating plan. And TWC and Bright House are in better condition than legacy Charter was 4 years ago. And we have meaningful transaction synergies, which will help offset short-term FX and investments we need to make to create long run operating momentum in the marketplace. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chris."

I'll largely focus on pro forma results as comparison prior to actuals aren't helpful given the size of the transactions. Before going there though, I think it makes sense to just set the baseline for company by walking back through the basic building blocks. 
On Slide 8, you should see a summary sources and uses statement for the transactions. On the left-hand side of the slide, under Sources, you can see that the amount of debt that we issued for our transactions totaled approximately $23.8 billion, composed of $21.8 billion for the TWC transaction and $2 billion for the Bright House transaction. We also assumed approximately $22.5 billion principal value of TWC investment-grade debt already in place. And we issued approximately $33 billion in Charter stock to legacy TWC shareholders valued at the closing date, about $10.2 billion to Advance/Newhouse in the form of preferred and common partnership units also valued at the closing date and $5 billion in stock to Liberty Broadband and Liberty interactive in exchange for cash valued at the signing of the deals, all totaling about $96 billion in sources and uses for transactions. 
And other than the impact of a higher Charter share price at closing, the sources and uses were essentially as we outlined at signing. 
From the beginning, we carefully structured our transactions of TWC and Bright House in order to achieve the number of operating, tax and financing objectives by providing pari passu bank loans security to investment-grade bondholders we now have access to virtually all pockets of the debt markets, including long-dated, low-cost financing without separate financing silos. The debt we issued to finance our transactions was placed in the investment-grade market, the term loan market and in the high-yield market. And as Slide 9 indicates, our total debt outstanding now stands at just over $60 billion compared to our June 30 market cap of approximately $71 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 5.5%, 87%, of which is fixed with an average maturity of 11.5 years and close to 90% due after 2019. 
Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, which revalued assumed TWC debt to share market value on the balance sheet, our total net debt to last 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.4x. It was 4.2x pro forma for year 1 run rate synergy estimates. Our target leverage range remains at 4 to 4.5x and we'll target the lower end of that range. We've also committed to remain at 3.5x or below at the first inning level or CCO and maintain eligibility for inclusion in the investment-grade index. 
Given our EBITDA growth profile and positive cash flow, we expect to delever rapidly, providing us with excess capacity relative to our leverage targets. We could use that excess capacity in a number of ways, but in order of priority, we will invest in our business, including areas to provide faster and more sustainable growth; pursue accretive M&A when available and ready; return capital to service in the form of share repurchases; and if we had no better use of cash for prudent to reduce our target leverage, we'll pay debt. 
Turning to our ownership structure. As Slide 10 shows, as of June 30, public shareholders held 68% of Charter. Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive together have an economic ownership stake in Charter of approximately 19%. On an as-converted and as-exchange basis of its partnership units, Advance/Newhouse held an economic state in Charter of approximately 13% and had a governance through its corresponding share at the corporate level. 
We currently have 13 board members composed of 8 unaffiliated board members, including Tom, our Chairman; 3 Liberty-related board members; and 2 Advance/Newhouse affiliated board members. 
On the right-hand side of 10, Slide 10, you'll see that, at closing, Charter had approximately 270 million shares outstanding, however, including the impact of the Advance/Newhouse fully converting and exchanging its common and preferred partnership units, Charter's outstanding shares totaled 311 million. Those partnership units are exchangeable at anytime, so it makes sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as-converted and as-exchanged basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value and share-based metrics. Some outlets continue to only look at the outstanding shares, which drives large differences in reported market capitalization.
Turning to the presentation of our financials on Slide 11. This slide lists some of the key transaction-related accounting items, some of which are onetime in nature. Starting with revenue at the top of the slide, our pro forma results eliminate a number of revenue items, including within legacy TWC revenue, the management fee from Bright House that previously existed; and in consolidation, affiliate fees for the Dodgers and Lakers [indiscernible] that TWC received from Charter and Bright House. Additionally, certain items like late fees, which were previously classified as contract expense of TWC and Bright House have been reclassified into revenue at each legacy entity. 
Turning to operating expenses. We've made the same revenue-related reclasses and mapped TWC and Bright House expenses into our operating model. We've also conformed accounting policies across the 3 companies with the largest difference between the level of capitalization of Bright House, as expected. For legacy TWC, we also moved both gains from sale of fixed assets and noncash share-based compensation below adjusted EBITDA. And under purchase price accounting, we've posted a liability on our balance sheet to reflect an estimate of the outer market portion of TWC's RSN distribution agreement with the Dodgers. While there's no change to the cash payments, the P&L expense associated with the rights fee is already lower in Q2. That expense is included in the regulatory connectivity and produce content line on our P&L. 
Below the adjusted EBITDA line, there were also a number of items to note. For purchase price accounting, we stepped up the value of TWC and Bright House assets on our balance sheet to fair market value, including PP&E and customer relationships. As a result, the depreciation and amortization charges are and will be higher than the simple addition of historical G&A. At closing, we also replaced TWC stock awards with Charter stock awards. The post closing vesting of these awards increased the stock compensation by reflecting the fair value of these replacement stock awards at closing instead of their original grant value. We also booked a number of merger and restructuring expenses in the other operating expense line, including onetime contingencies that closed for transaction advisory, including legal, M&A advisory at both TWC and Charter and financing fees. And employee severance expenses were roughly $300 million, nearly half of which came from the accelerated vesting of stock at the now stepped-up purchase price value. And the rationalization of 3 corporate groups will likely take a year and so we expect to continue to see severance in the other operating expenses line for several quarters.
Post closing, we announced a new retirement program across the company, which is designed to be competitive in the marketplace and give employees more control over their retirement funds to a higher defined contribution match. The Bright House defined benefit plan had already been frozen by Advance/Newhouse just prior to close and remains with Advance/Newhouse. However, as part of the new retirement program at Charter, we recorded a onetime curtailment gain when we announced in June that we'll freezer the TWC benefit plan -- defined benefit plan at the end of August. For those who are interested, this means using the ABL instead of the PBL when measuring the net liability. 
Purchase price accounting also resulted in a step-up of the value of acquired TWC debt to its fair market value at its closing date. The premium between the fair value of closing and the principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt driving GAAP interest expense well below cash interest expense. Our run rate annualize cash interest expense is $3.3 billion whereas the Q2 pro forma P&L interest expense would suggest to $2.9 billion annual run rate.
We refinanced an existing Charter debt in the quarter, driving charges [indiscernible] extinguishment of debt client. The loss of financial instruments line reflects a onetime termination expense for TWC's interest rate swaps and a change in valuation of legacy TWC British pound debt and related currency swaps. 
Turning to tax expense. Nearly all of the $3.3 billion valuation allowance against legacy Charter's deferred tax assets was renewed given the greater visibility and certainty around the use of legacy Charter's NOLs on our consolidated tax return, that drives for onetime tax benefit of nearly $3.2 billion in the quarter. 
We're also now expensing a quarterly charge of approximately $338 million in preferred coupon for Advance/Newhouse's preferred partnership units. That charge is being reported on a separate line as noncontrolling interest expense, along with backing out that portion of consolidated net income attributable to Advance/Newhouse's partnership units.
Finally, as you review our trending schedules, keep in mind that all customer and passing stated that you see are based on legacy company definitions. In a few quarter's time, we'll recast the customer data and the trending schedules using the same set of common definitions. When we do that, the goal will be to recast all historical data as well. And until then, certain data like net adds and ARPU, they remain relevant for legacy entity trends but they're less helpful when comparing one entity to another. 
So moving on to Q2. Although second quarter results really just reflects the sum of 3 different operating strategies, I wanted to provide some high-level commentary on our second quarter customer and financial results on a pro forma basis. Total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, 4.8% at TWC, 6.3% at Charter and 4.1% at Bright House. During the second quarter, in which Bright House seasonals amplify the normal second quarter cable seasonality, we grew residential PSUs by 167,000 versus 201,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, in particular due to a low-price voice offering in TWC markets in Q2 of last year. 
In residential video, over the last year, TWC was essentially flat on subscribers, Charter grew by 1% video and Bright House lost 3.6%. Quarterly video net losses improved year-over-year at both Bright House and at legacy Charter. While TWC's video net loss was 28,000 were less than last year primarily driven by an increase in turn. In total for Q2, we lost 152,000 residential video customers, of which about half came from normal video, normal Florida seasonal downgrades. That loss is an improvement to a loss of 170,000 total video customers in Q2 pro forma last year. 
In Residential Internet, we added a total of 236,000 customers in the quarter versus 157,000 last year. And our total Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.5% over the past year.
In voice, we grew customers by 83,000 versus 214,000 last year, really driven by the difference in offers in the marketplace that TWC and the higher amount of single play Internet sell-in at Bright House. 
Over the last year, total pro forma of residential customers grew by 1.1 million customers or by 4.8%. In the same period residential ARPU was up by about 1%. 
And as Slide 14 shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 5.6%. Excluding pay-per-view revenue, which included the Mayweather-Pacquiao event in Q2 of 2015 for all 3 companies, consolidated residential revenue grew by 6.3% and consolidated residential ARPU by 1.7%. 
Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 13.4%. At legacy Charter, we introduced a new pricing and packaging at both SMB and enterprise last year, and we're seeing the significant increase in sales and net adds we expected. With intend to make similar changes to legacy TWC and Bright House SMB and enterprise by next year. 
Finally, advertising was up 3.9% of political revenue growth accounting for about half of the $15 million growth year-over-year. In total, second quarter pro forma revenue was up by 6.6% year-over-year or 7.2%, excluding pay-per-view. 
Looking at total revenue growth at each of our legacy companies, including the effect of less boxing pay-per-view, TWC revenue grew by 7.2%. Although excluding the recognition revenue associated with settlements of a contractual dispute, revenue grew by 6.8%. Legacy Charter grew by 6.7% or 7% when excluding a onetime charge for customer credits in the quarter. And Bright House revenue grew by 3.3% or 3.0%, when excluding the benefit from the same and settled dispute at TWC.
Turning to fourth quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 15. We've generally mapped all TWC and Bright House operating expenses to legacy Charter's expense categories, although there were likely some expense remapping in subsequent quarters. On a pro forma basis, total operating expenses grew by $326 million or 5.3% year-over-year, in line with total residential and SMB customer growth of 5.1% with transition expense accounting for $25 million of total OpEx this quarter. 
Programming increased 7.5% year-on-year, driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by lower pay-per-view costs. Looking at programming this quarter, really is not that representative as we had a big quarter closing that drove recurring benefits in the Q2 subperiod but we also had a number of onetime nonrecurring charges at legacy Charter, including some fees, which were contingent on closing. As A Conforming accounting policy, we've also reclassed add by obligations to add revenue instead of expense to programming on the TWC's audit ledger. Net-net, I expect our programming line item and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by the end of this year. 
Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produce content expense, these direct costs were virtually flat year-over-year and benefit from the purchase accounting adjustments made to the Dodgers contract that I mentioned earlier. Cost of service customers grew by 2.1% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which really reflects the significantly lower service transactions at legacy Charter. 
And other expenses grew by 8.5%, driven by higher corporate, administrative labor cost, again, on a pro forma basis, including preclosing bonus accrual true-ups, higher IT resources at legacy TWC, advertising sales cost and enterprises sales and labor costs, partly offset by overhead reductions, which only started in June. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash share-based compensation grew by 9%. Excluding transition cost, adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.2%. There were clearly a lot of moving pieces this quarter, but from an accounting treatment perspective, as well as nonrecurring items, but excluding that noise, the pro forma growth rate was probably more in the 7% to 8% range. And as we make the changes Tom laid out, there'll be a lot of activity impacting the financials there different subscriber until we have a consistent product and service across our entire footprint.
Bigger picture is legacy Charter EBITDA growth for April and May, without any synergy benefit, was well into double-digit growth, reflecting the benefits of our operating model and what we intend to do with some larger set of assets long term. 
During the mid-quarter closing of our transaction, there's little to talk about with respect to realized operating cost synergies in our Q2 results. We do, however, expect synergies to materialize in the second half of this year and will highlight estimates of what's in the quarter going forward. We've already identified run rate annualized transaction-related operating expense synergies of over $600 million by the first anniversary of close. And we expect our initial synergy outline of $800 million per year by year 3 will be exceeded.
At Charter, we define transaction synergies as those which result purely from the combination of the companies. They do not reflect operating synergies, which come from operating decisions and investments that increase revenue and lower service transaction cost. 
Turning to Slide 16 where we shared both pro forma and actual net income for the second quarter. Our actual second quarter income statement reflects legacy Charter's results of to May 18, plus the results of the 3 legacy entities from May 18 to June 30. It also includes onetime expenses that are directly tied to the closing of the transactions. Conversely, the pro forma P&L assumes the 3 legacy entities have been one company and excludes onetime expenses and benefits that are directly tied to closing of the transactions. The background I provided on purchase accounting earlier and the detailed schedule on Slide 16 should help people understand the P&L down to net income on both the natural basis and on a pro forma basis. 
On our actual P&L, the biggest driver of net income is clearly the onetime benefit of the devaluation allowance release of $3.3 billion. With TWC and Bright House income, the timing and visibility of utilizing our NOLs on a consolidated tax return is no longer uncertain from an accounting perspective. The noncontrolling interest expense line will be a recurring charge on our income statement as long as Advance/Newhouse holds an interest in the partnership. 
Turning to Slide 17. Pro forma capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, including $111 million of transition capital expenditures. Excluding transition CapEx, our second quarter CapEx was up by $137 million or 7.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by the TWC Max all-digital initiative but looks to be some pull forward spend on CMTS and network routers that TWC preclosed in the infrastructure line, investments in product development at both Charter and TWC which also falls scalable infrastructure as well as previous leasehold improvement and real estate investment at TWC, including data center, warehousing and initiatives, which were in support capital. 
In Q2, excluding transition capital, TWC spent capital of approximately 21% and Charter 18% and Bright House 15% of revenue, respectively. Going forward, will reduce the spend on IT, product development and other areas which were by definition duplicative. We should see a short-term benefit from the regrouping on the remaining all-digital project, as Tom outlined.
Slide 18 shows the actual free cash flow we generated in the second quarter and only reflects legacy Charter's results through May 17, plus the results of the 3 legacy entities from May 18 to June 30. 
Finally, turning to our tax assets on Slide 19. At of the closing of our transactions and as expected, we had a change in ownership as per Section 382 of the IRS code, which re-restricted the availability of our NOLs. We believe the net present value of our tax assets was not impaired. The transactions create a larger base of taxable income ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus their utilization pace at legacy Charter. 
Today, we're providing a primary updated NOL availability schedule, which you can see at the bottom of the left -- bottom left-hand side of this slide. At the chart shows, we expect the vast majority of our $11.5 billion of our NOLs will be available for use by the end of 2018. As of now, we don't expect to be a material cash income taxed until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income, excluding the impact of higher depreciation and amortization from purchase price accounting, should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom."

But it does require you to retrain your workforce and to set up processes to provide the products that you want to sell. So we need to make sure that we have an advanced video product in every market where we launch pricing and packaging and our data speeds can be taken up to where they need to be. And it's logistically complex, but not that disruptive to the consumer. What is disruptive to the consumer though is continued all-digital rollouts that requires hardware going into consumer homes. So about 40% of Time Warner assets are not all-digital that currently and 50% of Bright House are not all-digital. So those transactions are disruptive, more disruptive, but necessary in order to get you in a place where you have a superior product set relative to all your competitors. If you look at the history of Charter and its growth rate and it's trending schedules as you'd inquired about, there are good proxy for what we expect to happen going forward in these new assets. The difference in these assets is that physically they're in better shape, so there's probably less capital required in them. But from a consumer perspective and from driving revenue and driving consumer stats, the Charter experience is a good proxy. With regard to your question on the guide, yes, there's some issues around the guide in rolling it out in the new assets. And they have to do with provisioning system. So you have 3 different companies that talk to their hardware modems, voice devices, as well as TV set-top boxes and creates a billing environment and the control environment around all of that hardware in the field as well as the billing environment that goes over of top. All of those are things are separate functions that have to be integrated and require an IT infrastructure over top of all of the existing legacies structures to unify what products can go where. In the guide is to some extent how to wait for that physical infrastructure to get put in place. So we think we can do that as we roll out the all-digital strategy, and we don't think it's anything like that. But it does it takes time and it's complicated."

One of that was also coming from downgrades from a point where you have promotional pricing roll off. That's a function of not having the highest quality product that we could offer in place and the best price you could offer and making it competitive in the marketplace and not having a consistent way of rolling the pricing up at promotion, which means essentially that the product doesn't stick. So in terms of going forward, the more the base that you can get on pricing and packaging, the more sticky that base becomes, not only in the face of competition, but also in the context of step-up in price. But you're still exposed along the way to the legacy base that hasn't migrated to new pricing and packaging has to what happens to them at roll offs, what you will allow them off to what that retention offers have in place and how quickly you can either proactively reactively migrated that base into the new pricing and packaging. Fairly complex. No different that what was the done at legacy Charter in 2012 to 2014 time period. So we'll just manage through it the same way that we did then."

If you look at those 7 million, they only -- a substantial portion are satellite customers. And that has to do with analog nature of the video product that the cable companies sell. And by going all-digital and using your 2-way interactive platform, you can build a better video product than your competitors, in my opinion, which is why I think Charter is growing its video business year-over-year. It's a slow process. The interia is real in the marketplace. But it's a -- yes, I think Charter has turned the video business positively. And I think the same is possible in Time Warner and Bright House. But it requires the proper investment in a video product, which means you need a 2-way product with an excellent user interface and all the functionality and features that you get from an intranet type like service with lime fully-featured content. So I think there's still have lots of upside selling traditional MVPD products that cable service to customers of broadband only. That said, there is an income issue with television. It's very expensive to buy the whole package. It's hard to sell smaller packages that resonate in a market and are sticky and are satisfied consumers. And various marketing tactics have been tried to skinny down the product. The problem is skinny-ing it down to the right place with the right package and satisfying people who are financially challenged and we'll continue to explore relationships with content companies to do that. But I also think you can make a fully-featured service more attractive as a more worth of what it does cause. And we can use that to drive into the marketplace."

But based on what I've already said, I think you can deduce a few things going through the 3 categories that you listed. Programming, we only had half a quarter in essence of Charter being in a closed status and in addition to that, you had a number of onetime legacy Charter some of contingent fees that are going to paid to program, so by definition, it means that result improves. Going against that over time is that if you're a rich video product into the marketplace and you're selling more as Tom was talking about, that's not rate base growth, that's programming, that's volume-based that your company buy at higher revenue and less term. So we look at the transaction piece of that as rate versus volume. The second piece that you highlighted was cost to serve where the cost-to-serve is really benefiting from the significant operating synergies that exist at legacy Charter as a result of having a simpler product in the marketplace for customers knowing that we step-up rate that is a fair rate and not continuing to keep on calling in to do a deal that reduces your call volume, reduces your churn and the insource labor also being a key function as well. Going the other way, so that's the legacy Charter, which is really helping the results. We're going to continuing to -- we're going to continue to insource TWC and Bright House create some of the same pressures that we saw at Charter and cost to serve line at the beginning as we insource labor force that needs to be trained up and you have paralleled outsourced in place while you're doing that so it's going to be dynamic as we go. For the other category, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this includes corporate advertising and enterprise and the particularly from a corporate perspective, lot of the headcount reductions that didn't really occur or begin to occur until June and those will be continuing on for some time. So there should be some improvements in that line item on a go-forward basis. And then, our goal here is even it cost us a little bit more by putting richer product in place on programming or whether it causes more upfront insourcing in place for cost to serve and things like IT and whatnot is to generate operating leverage at the back end by being able to scale it up front and reduces transactions over time and make more of the revenue flow through to EBITDA."

But I think the thing that is clear is that one of the big drivers for spend in the first half of the year on a pro forma basis, again, managing -- it wasn't as monitor managing the combined CapEx, we're just reporting what on it today on a pro forma basis, but there was obviously the significant amount of all-digital activity that's continuing at TWC and that will be more put on hold as we put in the Charter all-digital strategy beginning at the beginning of next year. There was also what I believe is pull forward of good capital, significant pull forward of capital around CMTS and routers in some type of activity that should slow down a little bit as well. But the danger in providing CapEx guidance or even expectations is frankly, as we see the opportunity to go make an investment that's going to put it the company in a position to grow faster, then we're going to do that inside of a particular quarter or inside of a particular last 12 months or fiscal year. And our view on the trends of CapEx is that capital intensity will go down significantly once we get through the all-digital program. But from a timing perspective, we see opportunities grow faster by investing quicker, even though the total gross dollars invested may not be any different, we'll pull it forward as we need to and we don't want to be to slowing down the growth trajectory of the company to meet more this, in our view, an artificial target. So now, we will be providing an outlook for this year. But I think if it's look at the way we look at capital in the past at Charter, it's meant to be efficient and to drive faster growth."

On May 18, we closed our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint, giving us the local and national scale to innovate",1054,":  
          Thanks, Stefan. On May 18, we closed our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint, giving us the local and national scale to innovate and grow faster. Our high-capacity network now reaches nearly 49 million homes and businesses and we have over 25 million residential and business customers in attractive markets. Our ability to use mass media effectively has increased from approximately 50% of passings at legacy Charter to the mid-90% range today. This gives us better local sales, marketing and branding capabilities, service delivery and field operations, efficiencies and a greater ability to reach and serve medium- and long-term -- excuse me, medium and large commercial customers. 
The new scale will accelerate video and advanced advertising product development and deepen our wireless service offerings over time. There are also meaningful one-time transaction synergies which will prove higher than previously outlined. Nevertheless, the execution of Charter's high-growth customer-focused operating strategy across a larger service footprint remains the largest contributor to shareholder value in our plans. 
Since the close, we found what we thought we would and we put in place a single centralized operating and financial control structure. We're standardizing our business practices and processes, including the IT service infrastructure, which will be completed over the next 2-plus years, as well as our products, pricing and packaging across all of our regions over the next year. And finally, we'll continue to develop and launch new products and services, which position Charter for long-term growth. 
At closing, all of our employees were mapped to their respective business units and executives based on our operating model. Today, the bulk of our 90,000-plus employees remain in the field, inside our operating regions and call centers. 
We've already begun insourcing efforts for the new company. The process of insourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people, train them and equip them with trucks, tools and test equipment and house them in new and expanded facilities. That process has already started as we are building Charter's first Spanish-language call center in McAllen, Texas with approximately 600 seats. Ultimately, with a more local workforce, we'll perform higher quality transactions with customers, which we expect will improve customer satisfaction, reduce transactions and costs and extend average customer lives, thereby growing our customer base and cash flow efficiently. 
In the fall, we'll begin to rebrand Time Warner Cable and Bright House and launch our Spectrum pricing and packaging in a number of key markets totaling over 40% of our acquired passings with the remainder in the first half of 2017. On the small and medium business side, we'll launch full-spectrum small business product pricing and packaging in TWC and Bright House markets in early and mid-2017. 
In 2017, the all-digital project at Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets will use the Charter all-digital strategy, which uses fully functioning 2-way set-top boxes with Video On Demand and advanced guide functionality on every TV outlet. We expect the project to be completed by 2018. We will also extend our practice of performing electronic connections instead of physical truck rolls as we go all-digital, allowing us to fully scale our self-installation and self-service practices. 
Our plan is to have Spectrum Guide available in most legacy Charter markets by the end of this year. We will launch Spectrum Guide in TWC's larger markets by the middle of 2017 and other TWC and Bright House markets following through the year and likely continuing through 2018 as we complete the all-digital project. 
Now that we're closed, we're running a WiFi network in public spaces throughout the country as well as on a widely distributed indoor terrestrial wireless network, which combined with MVNO opportunities and other wireless building blocks, should allow us to create products and services with a high value proposition. Over time, we'll have more to discuss on this subject. 
Chris will cover the second quarter results in more detail in a moment. But the overview is that legacy Charter continued to perform very well in the quarter, with better subscriber growth than the prior year. And on a stand-alone basis through closing, legacy Charter continued to show double-digit and improving EBITDA growth. Bright House also improved its customer performance year-over-year. While Bright House has benefited from Frontier's acquisition of certain FiOS properties, it should be noted that because most of its footprint is in Florida, it is subject to greater second quarter seasonality than both Charter and Time Warner Cable. 
Legacy Time Warner Cable is in better shape than just a couple of years ago with growth in customer relationships. During the second quarter last year, Time Warner had a very aggressive voice promotion, making voice net add comparisons with this third quarter negative. However, our second quarter pro forma results have to be seen in context because they reflect the continuation of previous operating strategies, much of which are different from our plan. 
Through different metrics and stages of development, we can see that TWC and more recently, Bright House, have both become reliant on rate increases and retention offers, each of which has various short- and long-term effects, including encouraging customers to initiate more transactions. We've addressed these types of issues at legacy Charter and will do so at TWC and Bright House during the Spectrum pricing and packaging migration. 
Generally though, we're very pleased with how TWC and Bright House managed the assets through closing. Our pro forma total customer relationships increased by 173,000 during the second quarter compared to 54,000 last year and our year-over-year pro forma revenue growth of 6.6% and pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% in Q2 demonstrates the health of our business. We will make the necessary investments in using the same approach we used at Charter to put the new assets on the right long-term growth strategy. The big difference today is that we have an established management team with experience running our operating plan. And TWC and Bright House are in better condition than legacy Charter was 4 years ago. And we have meaningful transaction synergies, which will help offset short-term effects and investments we need to make to create long run operating momentum in the marketplace. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chris."

          Thanks, Tom. I'll largely focus on pro forma results as comparisons to prior-year actuals aren't helpful given the size of the transactions. Before going there though, I think it makes sense to just set the baseline for new company by walking back through the basic building blocks. 
On Slide 8, you should see a summary sources and uses statement for the transactions. On the left-hand side of the slide, under Sources, you can see that the amount of debt that we issued for our transactions totaled approximately $23.8 billion, composed of $21.8 billion for the TWC transaction and $2 billion for the Bright House transaction. We also assumed approximately $22.5 billion principal value of TWC investment-grade debt already in place. And we issued approximately $33 billion in Charter stock to legacy TWC shareholders valued at the closing date, about $10.2 billion to Advance/Newhouse in the form of preferred and common partnership units also valued at the closing date and $5 billion in stock to Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive in exchange for cash valued at the signing of the deals, all totaling about $96 billion in sources and uses for transactions. 
And other than the impact of a higher Charter share price at closing, the sources and uses were essentially as we outlined at signing. 
From the beginning, we carefully structured our transactions of TWC and Bright House in order to achieve a number of operating, tax and financing objectives by providing pari passu bank loans security to investment-grade bondholders we now have access to virtually all pockets of the debt markets, including long-dated, low-cost financing without separate financing silos. The debt we issued to finance our transactions was placed in the investment-grade market, the term loan market and in the high-yield market. And as Slide 9 indicates, our total debt outstanding now stands at just over $60 billion compared to our June 30 market cap of approximately $71 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 5.5%, 87% of which is fixed with an average maturity of 11.5 years and close to 90% due after 2019. 
Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, which revalued assumed TWC debt to share market value on the balance sheet, our total net debt to last 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.4x. It was 4.2x pro forma for year 1 run rate synergy estimates. Our target leverage range remains at 4 to 4.5x and we'll target the lower end of that range. We've also committed to remain at 3.5x or below at the first inning level or at CCO and maintain eligibility for inclusion in the investment-grade index. 
Given our EBITDA growth profile and positive cash flow, we expect to delever rapidly, providing us with excess capacity relative to our leverage targets. We could use that excess capacity in a number of ways, but in order of priority, we will invest in our business, including areas that provide faster and more sustainable growth; pursue accretive M&A when available and ready; return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases; and if we had no better use of cash for prudent to reduce our target leverage, we'll pay debt. 
Turning to our ownership structure. As Slide 10 shows, as of June 30, public shareholders held 68% of Charter. Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive together have an economic ownership stake in Charter of approximately 19%. On an as-converted and as-exchange basis of its partnership units, Advance/Newhouse held an economic stake in Charter of approximately 13% and had a governance through its corresponding B share at the corporate level. 
We currently have 13 board members composed of 8 unaffiliated board members, including Tom, our Chairman; 3 Liberty-related board members; and 2 Advance/Newhouse affiliated board members. 
On the right-hand side of 10, Slide 10, you'll see that, at closing, Charter had approximately 270 million shares outstanding.  However, including the impact of the Advance/Newhouse fully converting and exchanging its common and preferred partnership units, Charter's outstanding shares totaled 311 million. Those partnership units are exchangeable at any time, so it makes sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as-converted and as-exchanged basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value and most share-based metrics. Some outlets continue to only look at the outstanding shares, which drives large differences in reported market capitalization.
Turning to the presentation of our financials on Slide 11. The slide lists some of the key transaction-related accounting items, some of which are onetime in nature. Starting with revenue at the top of the slide, our pro forma results eliminate a number of revenue items, including within legacy TWC revenue, the management fee from Bright House that previously existed; and in consolidation, affiliate fees for the Dodgers and Lakers RSNs that TWC received from Charter and Bright House. Additionally, certain items like late fees, which were previously classified as contra-expense at TWC and Bright House have been reclassified into revenue at each legacy entity. 
Turning to operating expenses. We've made the same revenue-related reclasses and mapped TWC and Bright House expenses into our operating model. We've also conformed accounting policies across the 3 companies with the largest difference between the level of capitalization of Bright House, as expected. For legacy TWC, we also moved both gains from sale of fixed assets and noncash share-based compensation below adjusted EBITDA. And under purchase price accounting, we've posted a liability on our balance sheet to reflect an estimate of the out of market portion of TWC's RSN distribution agreement with the Dodgers. While there's no change to the cash payments, the P&L expense associated with the rights fee was already lower in Q2. That expense is included in the regulatory connectivity and produced content line on our P&L. 
Below the adjusted EBITDA line, there were also a number of items to note. For purchase price accounting, we stepped up the value of TWC and Bright House assets on our balance sheet to fair market value, including PP&E and customer relationships. As a result, the depreciation and amortization charges are and will be higher than the simple addition of historical DNA. At closing, we also replaced TWC employee stock awards with Charter stock awards. The post closing vesting of these awards increased the stock compensation by reflecting the fair value of these replacement stock awards at closing instead of their original grant value. We also booked a number of merger and restructuring expenses in the other operating expense line, including onetime contingencies at close for transaction advisory, including legal, M&A advisory at both TWC and Charter and financing fees. And employee severance expenses of roughly $300 million, nearly half of which came from the accelerated vesting of stock at the now stepped-up purchase price value. And the rationalization of 3 corporate groups will likely take a year and so we expect to continue to see severance in the other operating expenses line for several quarters.
Post closing, we announced a new retirement program across the company, which is designed to be competitive in the marketplace and give employees more control over their retirement funds through a higher defined contribution match. The Bright House defined benefit plan had already been frozen by Advance/Newhouse at just prior to close and remains with Advance/Newhouse. However, as part of the new retirement program at Charter, we recorded a onetime curtailment gain when we announced in June that we'll freeze the TWC benefit plan -- defined benefit plan at the end of August. For those who are interested, this means using the ABO instead of the PBO when measuring the net liability. 
Purchase price accounting also resulted in a step-up of the value of acquired TWC debt to its fair market value as its closing date. The premium between the fair value of closing and the principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt, driving GAAP interest expense well below cash interest expense. Our run rate annualized cash interest expense is $3.3 billion, whereas the Q2 pro forma P&L interest expense would suggest a $2.9 billion annual run rate.
We refinanced an existing Charter debt in the quarter, driving charges through the lost on extinguishment of debt line. The loss of financial instruments line reflects a onetime termination expense for TWC's interest rate swaps and a change in valuation of legacy TWC British pound debt and related currency swaps. 
Turning to tax expense. Nearly all of the $3.3 billion valuation allowance against legacy Charter's deferred tax assets was removed, given the greater visibility and certainty around the use of legacy Charter's NOLs on our consolidated tax return.  That drove a onetime tax benefit of nearly $3.2 billion in the quarter. 
We're also now expensing a quarterly charge of approximately $338 million in preferred coupon for Advance/Newhouse's preferred partnership units. That charge is being reported on a separate line as noncontrolling interest expense, along with backing out that portion of consolidated net income attributable to Advance/Newhouse's common partnership units.
Finally, as you review our trending schedules, keep in mind that all customer and passings data that you see are based on legacy company definitions. In a few quarters' time, we'll recast the customer data and the trending schedules using the same set of common definitions. When we do that, the goal will be to recast all historical data as well. And until then, certain data like net adds and ARPU, they remain relevant for legacy entity trends but they're less helpful when comparing one entity to another. 
So moving on to Q2. Although second quarter results really just reflect the sum of 3 different operating strategies, I wanted to provide some high-level commentary on our second quarter customer and financial results on a pro forma basis. Total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, 4.8% at TWC, 6.3% at Charter and 4.1% at Bright House. During the second quarter, in which Bright House Florida seasonals amplify the normal second quarter cable seasonality, we grew residential PSUs by 167,000 versus 201,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, in particular due to a low-price voice offering in TWC markets in Q2 of last year. 
In residential video, over the last year, TWC was essentially flat on subscribers, Charter grew by 1% video and Bright House lost 3.6%. Quarterly video net losses improved year-over-year at both Bright House and at legacy Charter. While TWC's video net loss was 28,000 worse than last year primarily driven by an increase in churn. In total for Q2, we lost 152,000 residential video customers, of which about half came from normal video, normal Florida seasonal downgrades. That loss is an improvement to a loss of 170,000 total video customers in Q2 pro forma last year. 
In Residential Internet, we added a total of 236,000 customers in the quarter versus 157,000 last year. And our total Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.5% over the past year.
In voice, we grew customers by 83,000 versus 214,000 last year, really driven by the difference in offers in the marketplace at TWC and the higher amount of single play Internet sell-in at Bright House. 
Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million customers or by 4.8%. In the same period, residential ARPU was up by about 1%. 
And as Slide 14 shows, our customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 5.6%. Excluding pay-per-view revenue, which included the Mayweather-Pacquiao event in Q2 of 2015 for all 3 companies, consolidated residential revenue grew by 6.3% and consolidated residential ARPU by 1.7%. 
Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 13.4%. At legacy Charter, we introduced a new pricing and packaging at both SMB and enterprise last year, and we're seeing the significant increase in sales and net adds we expected. With intend to make similar changes to legacy TWC and Bright House SMB and enterprise by next year. 
Finally, advertising was up 3.9%, with political revenue growth accounting for about half of the $15 million growth year-over-year. In total, second quarter pro forma revenue was up by 6.6% year-over-year or 7.2%, excluding pay-per-view. 
Looking at total revenue growth at each of our legacy companies, including the effect of less boxing pay-per-view, TWC revenue grew by 7.2%. Although excluding the recognition revenue associated with settlements of a contractual dispute, revenue grew by 6.8%. Legacy Charter grew by 6.7% or 7% when excluding a onetime charge for customer credits in the quarter. And Bright House revenue grew by 3.3% or 3.0%, when excluding the benefit from the same settled dispute at TWC.
Turning to fourth quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 15. We've generally mapped all TWC and Bright House operating expenses to legacy Charter's expense categories, although there will likely some expense remapping in subsequent quarters. On a pro forma basis, total operating expenses grew by $326 million or 5.3% year-over-year, in line with total residential and SMB customer growth of 5.1%, with transition expense accounting for $25 million of our total OpEx this quarter. 
Programming increased 7.5% year-on-year, driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by lower pay-per-view costs. Looking at programming this quarter, really is not that representative as we had a big quarter closing that drove recurring benefits in the Q2 subperiod, but we also had a number of onetime nonrecurring charges at legacy Charter, including some fees, which were contingent on closing. As a conforming accounting policy, we've also reclassed ad buy obligations to add revenue instead of contra expense to programming on the TWC side of the ledger. Net-net, I expect our programming line item and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by the end of this year. 
Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were virtually flat year-over-year and benefit from the purchase accounting adjustments made to the Dodgers contract that I mentioned earlier. Cost to service customers grew by 2.1% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which really reflects the significantly lower service transactions at legacy Charter. 
And other expenses grew by 8.5%, driven by higher corporate administrative labor cost, again, on a pro forma basis, including preclosing bonus accrual true-ups, higher IT resources at legacy TWC, advertising sales cost and enterprises sales and labor costs, partly offset by overhead reductions, which only started in June. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash share-based compensation grew by 9%. Excluding transition cost, adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.2%. There were clearly a lot of moving pieces this quarter, but from an accounting treatment perspective, as well as nonrecurring items.  But excluding that noise, the pro forma growth rate was probably more in the 7% to 8% range. And as we make the changes Tom laid out, there'll be a lot of activity impacting the financials through different subscriber vintages until we have a consistent product and service across our entire footprint.
Bigger picture is legacy Charter EBITDA growth for April and May, without any synergy benefit, was well into double-digit growth, reflecting the benefits of our operating model and what we intend to do with the larger set of assets long term. 
During the mid-quarter closing of our transaction, there's little to talk about with respect to realized operating cost synergies in our Q2 results. We do, however, expect synergies to materialize in the second half of this year and will highlight estimates of what's in the quarter going forward. We've already concretely identified run rate annualized transaction-related operating expense synergies of over $600 million by the first anniversary of close. And we expect our initial synergy outline of $800 million per year by year 3 will be exceeded.
At Charter, we define transaction synergies as those which result purely from the combination of the companies. They do not reflect operating synergies, which come from operating decisions and investments that increase revenue and lower service transaction costs. 
Turning to Slide 16 where we share both pro forma and actual net income for the second quarter. Our actual second quarter income statement reflects legacy Charter's results up to May 18, plus the results of the 3 legacy entities from May 18 through June 30. It also includes onetime expenses that are directly tied to the closing of the transactions. Conversely, the pro forma P&L assumes the 3 legacy entities have been one company and excludes onetime expenses and benefits that are directly tied to closing of the transactions. The background I provided on purchase accounting earlier and the detailed schedule on Slide 16 should help people understand the P&L down to net income on both a natural basis and on a pro forma basis. 
On our actual P&L, the biggest driver of net income is clearly the onetime benefit of the valuation allowance release of $3.3 billion. With TWC and Bright House income, the timing and visibility of utilizing our NOLs on a consolidated tax return is no longer uncertain from an accounting perspective. The noncontrolling interest expense line will be a recurring charge on our income statement as long as Advance/Newhouse holds an interest in the partnership. 
Turning to Slide 17. Pro forma capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, including $111 million of transition capital expenditures. Excluding transition CapEx, our second quarter CapEx was up by $137 million or 7.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by the TWC Max all-digital initiative, but looks to be some pull forward spend on CMTS and network routers at TWC preclose in the scalable infrastructure line, investments in product development at both Charter and TWC, which also falls in scalable infrastructure, as well as previous leasehold improvement and real estate investments at TWC, including data center, warehousing and head end initiatives, which were booked in support capital. 
In Q2, excluding transition capital, TWC spent capital of approximately 21%, Charter 18% and Bright House 15% of revenue, respectively. Going forward, obviously we'll reduce the spend on IT, product development and other areas which were, by definition, duplicative. And we should see a short-term benefit from the regrouping on the remaining all-digital projects, as Tom outlined.
Slide 18 shows the actual free cash flow we generated in the second quarter and only reflects legacy Charter's results through May 17, plus the results of the 3 legacy entities from May 18 to June 30. 
Finally, turning to our tax assets on Slide 19. At of the closing of our transactions and as expected, we had a change in ownership as per Section 382 of the IRS code, which re-restricted the availability of our NOLs. We believe the net present value of our tax assets was not impaired. The transactions create a larger base of taxable income, ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus their utilization pace at legacy Charter. 
Today, we're providing a preliminary updated NOL availability schedule, which you can see at the bottom of the left -- bottom left-hand side of this slide. At the chart shows, we expect the vast majority of our $11.5 billion of our NOLs will be available for use by the end of 2018. As of now, we don't expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income, excluding the impact of higher depreciation and amortization from purchase price accounting, should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom."

Since our closing on May 18, we've been working to integrate 3 companies. And while integrating 3 large companies comes with issues and execution risks, we're picking our way through those issues and so far, we haven't seen anything that precludes us from being successful. Our track record at Charter over the last several years shows our operating model produces excellent economic value and we'll make the right investments as quickly as possible to apply our operating practices on the new assets. 
With our newfound scale comes additional opportunities unavailable to legacy Charter, including cost savings and purchasing opportunities, product development opportunities, commercial services opportunities, wireless service opportunities and more, and we're ready to exploit those opportunities in order to drive greater growth and value into our business. 
Operator, we're ready for questions."

And if you just take the Charter growth strategy and apply it to a much bigger set of assets and you do the same thing on those assets, get the same kind of growth rates, you create a lot of value.  But the other part of scale that comes out of this is that the footprint, the coverage of the DMA and our ability to take use of mass advertising as well as a sell advertising in DMA is improved by the efficiency of our coverage of local markets, meaning in historic terms, we're better clustered. So we have our ownership of assets by particular DMA more concentrated than we did at Charter. That gives you 2 things. It gives you the opportunity to be a better seller of services and products and it gives you the opportunity to be a better seller of advertising and targeted advertising and local products sold at -- on all the various platforms, the TV, the Internet and voice platforms, wireless platforms. And it also gives you, from a commercial sales perspective, a more likely footprint to serve medium-sized businesses and all the facilities those businesses pad or use within your footprint. So if you have a multi-site business, your ability to serve multi-sites with better footprint is improved and so the commercial marketplace is also improved.

          Right. Look, the pricing and packaging is mostly done incrementally. But it does require you to retrain your workforce and to set up processes to provide the products that you want to sell. So we need to make sure that we have an advanced video product in every market where we launch pricing and packaging and our data speeds can be taken up to where they need to be. So and it's logistically complex, but not that disruptive to the consumer. What is disruptive to the consumer though is continued all-digital rollout.  That requires hardware going into consumer homes. So about 40% of Time Warner assets are not all-digital currently and 50% of Bright House are not all-digital. So those transactions are disruptive, more disruptive, but necessary in order to get you in a place where you have a superior product set relative to all your competitors. If you look at the history of Charter and its growth rate and its trending schedules, as you'd inquire about, they're a good proxy for what we expect to happen going forward in these new assets. The difference in these assets is that physically, they're in better shape, so there's probably less capital required in them. But from a consumer perspective and driving revenue and driving consumer stats, the Charter experience is a good proxy. With regard to your question on the guide, yes, there are some issues around the guide in rolling it out in the new assets. And they have to do with provisioning systems. So you have 3 different companies that talk to their hardware modems, voice devices, as well as TV set-top boxes and create the billing environment and the control environment around all of that hardware in the field as well as the billing environment that goes over top of that. All of those are things are separate functions that have to be integrated and require an IT infrastructure over top of all of the existing legacies structures to unify what products can go where. And the guide, to some extent, has to wait for that physical infrastructure to get put in place. So we think we can do that as we roll out the all-digital strategy, and we don't think it's gating or anything like that. But it takes time and it's complicated."

There was a higher amount of churn at legacy TWC in Q2. A lot of that was also coming from downgrades at that point where you have promotional pricing roll off. That's a function of not having the highest quality product that you could offer in place at the best price you could offer and making it competitive in the marketplace and not having a consistent way of rolling the pricing up at promotion, which means essentially that the product doesn't stick. So in terms of going forward, the more of the base that you can get on pricing and packaging, the more sticky that base becomes, not only in the face of competition, but also in the context of step-up in price. But you're still exposed along the way [ph] to the legacy base that hasn't migrated to new pricing and packaging has to what happens to them at roll offs, what you allow them to roll off to, what retention offers you have in place and how quickly you can either proactively or reactively migrate that base into the new pricing and packaging.

Any color would be helpful if you had any."

          Well, Ben, I think the biggest opportunity continues to be selling against satellite. If you look at those 7 million data only subs, a substantial portion of them are satellite customers. And that has to do with the analog nature of the video product that the cable companies sell. And by going all-digital and using your 2-way interactive platform, you can build a better video product than your competitors, in my opinion, which is why I think Charter is growing its video business year-over-year. It's a slow process. The inertia is real in the marketplace. But it's -- I think Charter has turned the video business positively. And I think the same is possible in Time Warner and Bright House. But it requires the proper investment in a video product, which means you need a 2-way product with an excellent user interface and all the functionality and features that you get from an Internet type like service with live, fully-featured content. So I think there's still lots of upside selling traditional MVPD products at cable service to customers who have broadband only. That said, there is an income issue with television. It's very expensive to buy the whole package. It's hard to sell smaller packages that resonate in the market and are sticky and are satisfied consumers. And various marketing tactics have been tried to skinny down the product. The problem is skinny-ing it down to the right place with the right package and satisfying people who are financially challenged.  And we'll continue to explore relationships with content companies to do that. But I also think that you can make a fully-featured service more attractive and more worth what it does cost. And we can use that to drive into the marketplace."

          On the expense side, Ben, I don't want to get into the mode of providing guidance. But based on what I've already said, I think you can deduce a few things going through the 3 categories that you listed. Programming, we only had half a quarter in essence of Charter being in a closed status, and in addition to that, we had a number of onetime bad guys at legacy Charter, some of which was contingencies that are going to paid on closing to programmers. So by definition, that means that, that result improves. Going against that grain over time is that if you're putting a rich video product into the marketplace and you're selling more expanded, as Tom was talking about, that's not rate based growth, that's programming, that's volume-based, that the company buy at higher revenue and less churn. So we look at the transaction piece of that as rate versus volume. The second piece that you highlighted was cost to serve where the cost-to-serve is really benefiting from the significant operating synergies that exist at legacy Charter as a result of having a simpler product in the marketplace for customers knowing that we step-up rate, that is a fair rate and not continuing to keep on calling in to do a deal reduces your call volume, reduces your churn and the insourced labor also being a key function as well. And going the other way, so that's the legacy Charter, which is really helping the results. We're going to be continuing to -- we're going to continue to insource at TWC and Bright House. It's going to create some of the same pressures that we saw at Charter in the cost to serve line at the beginning, as we insource a labor force that needs to be trained up and you have parallel outsourced in place while you're doing that.  So it's going to be dynamic as we go. And for the other category, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this includes corporate advertising, enterprise and particularly from a corporate perspective, lot of the headcount reductions didn't really occur or begin to occur until June and those will be continuing on for some time. So there should be some improvements in that line item on a go-forward basis. And then, look, our goal here is even it cost us a little bit more by putting richer product in place on programming or whether it costs us more upfront to put insourcing in place for cost to serve and things like IT and whatnot is to generate operating leverage at the back end by being able to scale it up front and reduce transactions over time and make more of the revenue flow through to EBITDA."

          So we're not going to be providing CapEx guidance. But I think the thing that is clear is that one of the big drivers for spend in the first half of the year on a pro forma basis, again, managing -- it wasn't us managing the combined CapEx, we're just reporting on it today on a pro forma basis, but there was obviously the significant amount of all-digital activity that's continuing at TWC and that'll be more put on hold as we put in the Charter all-digital strategy beginning at the beginning of next year. There was also some, what I believe is pull forward of good capital, significant pull forward of capital around CMTS and routers and some of that type of activity that should slow down a little bit as well. But the danger in providing CapEx guidance or even expectations is, frankly, as we see the opportunity to go make an investment that's going to put the company in a position to grow faster, then we're going to do that inside of a particular quarter or inside of a particular last 12 months or fiscal year. And our view on the trends of CapEx is that capital intensity will go down significantly once we get through the all-digital program. But from a timing perspective, we see opportunities grow faster by investing quicker, even though the total gross dollars invested may not be any different, we'll pull it forward as we need to and we don't want to be beholden to slowing down the growth trajectory of the company to meet what is, in our view, kind of an artificial target. So now, we won't be providing an outlook for this year. But I think if you take a look at the way that we've managed capital in the past at Charter, it's meant to be efficient and to drive faster growth."

19609,374153314,1032087,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. On May 18, we closed our transaction with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint, giving us the local and national scale to innovate and grow faster",1053,"Thanks, Stefan. On May 18, we closed our transaction with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint, giving us the local and national scale to innovate and grow faster. Our high-capacity network now reaches nearly 49 million homes and businesses, and we have over 25 million residential and business customers in attractive markets. Our ability to use mass media effectively has increased from approximately 50% of passings at legacy Charter to the mid-90% range today. This gives us better local sales, marketing and branding capabilities, service delivery and field operations, efficiencies and a greater ability to reach and serve medium- and long-term -- excuse me, medium and large commercial customers. 
The new scale will accelerate video and advanced advertising product development and deepen our wireless service offerings over time. There are also meaningful onetime transaction synergies which will prove higher than previously outlined. Nevertheless, the execution of Charter's high-growth customer-focused operating strategy across a larger service footprint remains the largest contributor to shareholder value in our plans. 
Since the close, we found what we thought we would and we put in place a single centralized operating and financial control structure. We're standardizing our business practices and processes, including the IT service infrastructure, which will be completed over the next 2-plus years as well as our products, pricing and packaging across all of our regions over the next year. And finally, we'll continue to develop and launch new products and services, which position Charter for long-term growth. 
At closing, all of our employees were mapped to their respective business units and executives based on our operating model. Today, the bulk of our 90,000-plus employees remain in the field inside our operating regions and call centers. 
We've already begun insourcing efforts for the new company. The process of insourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people, train them and equip them with trucks, tools and test equipment, and house them in new and expanded facilities. That process has already started as we are building Charter's first Spanish-language call center in McAllen, Texas, with approximately 600 seats. Ultimately, with a more local workforce, we'll perform higher-quality transactions with customers, which we expect will improve customer satisfaction, reduce transactions and costs, and extend average customer lives, thereby growing our customer base and cash flow efficiently. 
In the fall, we'll begin to rebrand Time Warner Cable and Bright House and launch our Spectrum pricing and packaging in a number of key markets totaling over 40% of our acquired passings with the remainder in the first half of 2017. On the small and medium business side, we'll launch the full-spectrum small business product pricing and packaging in TWC and Bright House markets in early and mid-2017. 
In 2017, the all-digital project at Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets will use the Charter all-digital strategy, which uses fully functioning 2-way set-top boxes with Video On Demand and advanced guide functionality on every TV outlet. We expect the project to be completed by 2018. We will also extend our practice of performing electronic connections instead of physical truck rolls as we go all digital, allowing us to fully scale our self-installation and self-service practices. 
Our plan is to have Spectrum Guide available in most legacy Charter markets by the end of this year. We will launch Spectrum Guide in TWC's larger markets by the middle of 2017 and other TWC and Bright House markets following through the year and likely continuing through 2018 as we complete the all-digital project. 
Now that we're closed, we're running a WiFi network in public spaces throughout the country as well as on a widely distributed indoor terrestrial wireless network, which combined with MVNO opportunities and other wireless building blocks, should allow us to create products and services with a high value proposition. Over time, we'll have more to discuss on this subject. 
Chris will cover the second quarter results in more detail in a moment. But the overview is that legacy Charter continued to perform very well in the quarter with better subscriber growth than the prior year. And on a stand-alone basis through closing, legacy Charter continued to show double-digit and improving EBITDA growth. 
Bright House also improved its customer performance year-over-year. While Bright House has benefited from Frontier's acquisition of certain FiOS properties, it should be noted that because most of its footprint is in Florida, it is subject to greater second quarter seasonality than both Charter and Time Warner Cable. 
Legacy Time Warner Cable is in better shape than just a couple of years ago with growth in customer relationships. During the second quarter last year, Time Warner had a very aggressive voice promotion, making voice net add comparisons with this third quarter negative. However, our second quarter pro forma results have to be seen in context because they reflect the continuation of previous operating strategies, much of which are different from our plan. 
Through different metrics and stages of development, we can see that TWC and, more recently, Bright House, have both become reliant on rate increases and retention offers, each of which has various short- and long-term effects, including encouraging customers to initiate more transactions. We've addressed these types of issues at legacy Charter and will do so at TWC and Bright House during the Spectrum pricing and packaging migration. 
Generally though, we're very pleased with how TWC and Bright House manage the assets through closing. Our pro forma total customer relationships increased by 173,000 during the second quarter compared to 54,000 last year, and our year-over-year pro forma revenue growth of 6.6% and pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% in Q2 demonstrates the health of our business. 
We will make the necessary investments using the same approach we used at Charter to put the new assets on the right long-term growth strategy. The big difference today is that we have an established management team with experience running our operating plan. And TWC and Bright House are in better condition than legacy Charter was 4 years ago. And we have meaningful transaction synergies, which will help offset short-term effects in investments we need to make to create long-run operating momentum in the marketplace. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chris."

I'll largely focus on pro forma results as comparisons to prior-year actuals aren't helpful given the size of the transactions. Before going there though, I think it makes sense to set the baseline for the new company by walking back through the basic building blocks. 
On Slide 8, you should see a summary sources and uses statement for the transactions. On the left-hand side of the slide, under Sources, you can see that the amount of debt that we issued for our transactions totaled approximately $23.8 billion, composed of $21.8 billion for the TWC transaction and $2 billion for the Bright House transaction. We also assumed approximately $22.5 billion principal value of TWC investment-grade debt already in place. And we issued approximately $33 billion in Charter stock to legacy TWC shareholders valued at the closing date, about $10.2 billion to Advance/Newhouse in the form of preferred and common partnership units also valued at the closing date, and $5 billion in stock to Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive in exchange for cash valued at the signing of the deals, all totaling about $96 billion in sources and uses for our transactions. And other than the impact of a higher Charter share price at closing, the sources and uses were essentially as we outlined at signing. 
From the beginning, we carefully structured our transactions with TWC and Bright House in order to achieve a number of operating, tax and financing objectives. By providing pari passu bank loan security to investment-grade bondholders, we now have access to virtually all pockets of the debt markets, including long-dated, low-cost financing without separate financing silos. The debt we issued to finance our transactions was placed in the investment-grade market, the term loan market and in the high-yield market. And as Slide 9 indicates, our total debt outstanding now stands at just over $60 billion compared to our June 30 market cap of approximately $71 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 5.5%, 87% of which is fixed with an average maturity of 11.5 years and close to 90% due after 2019. 
Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, which revalued assumed TWC debt to fair market value on the balance sheet, our total net debt to last 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.4x. It was 4.2x pro forma for year 1 run rate synergy estimates. Our target leverage range remains at 4 to 4.5x, and we'll target the lower end of that range. We've also committed to remain at 3.5x or below at the first-inning level or at CCO and maintain eligibility for inclusion in the investment-grade index. 
Given our EBITDA growth profile and positive cash flow, we expect to delever rapidly, providing us with excess capacity relative to our leverage targets. We could use that excess capacity in a number of ways, but in order of priority, we'll invest in our business, including areas that provide faster and more sustainable growth; pursue accretive M&A when available and ready; return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases; and if we had no better use of cash or determine it prudent to reduce our target leverage, we'll pay down debt. 
Turning to our ownership structure. Slide 10 shows, as of June 30, public shareholders held 68% of Charter. Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive together have an economic ownership stake in Charter of approximately 19%. On an as-converted and as-exchange basis of its partnership units, Advance/Newhouse held an economic stake in Charter of approximately 13% and had governance through its corresponding B share at the corporate level. 
We currently have 13 board members composed of 8 unaffiliated board members, including Tom, our Chairman; 3 Liberty-related board members; and 2 Advance/Newhouse affiliated board members. 
On the right-hand side of 10, Slide 10, you'll see that, at closing, Charter had approximately 270 million shares outstanding. However, including the impact of the Advance/Newhouse fully converting and exchanging its common and preferred partnership units, Charter's outstanding shares totaled 311 million. Those partnership units are exchangeable at any time, so it makes sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as-converted and as-exchanged basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value in most share-based metrics. Some outlets continue to only look at the outstanding shares, which drives large differences in reported market capitalization.
Turning to the presentation of our financials on Slide 11. This slide lists some of the key transaction-related accounting items, some of which are onetime in nature. Starting with revenue at the top of the slide, our pro forma results eliminate a number of revenue items, including within legacy TWC revenue, the management fee from Bright House that previously existed; and in consolidation, affiliate fees for the Dodgers and Lakers RSNs that TWC received from Charter and Bright House. Additionally, certain items like late fees, which were previously classified as contra-expense at TWC and Bright House, have been reclassified into revenue at each legacy entity. 
Turning to operating expenses. We've made the same revenue-related reclasses and mapped TWC and Bright House expenses into our operating model. We've also conformed accounting policies across the 3 companies with the largest difference being the level of capitalization at Bright House, as expected. For legacy TWC, we also moved both gains from sale of fixed assets and noncash share-based compensation below adjusted EBITDA. And under purchase price accounting, we've posted a liability on our balance sheet to reflect an estimate of the out-of-market portion of TWC's RSN distribution agreement with the Dodgers. 
While there's no change to the cash payments, the P&L expense associated with the rights fee was already lower in Q2. That expense is included in the regulatory connectivity and produced content line on our P&L. 
Below the adjusted EBITDA line, there were also a number of items to note. For purchase price accounting, we stepped up the value of TWC and Bright House assets on our balance sheet to fair market value, including PP&E and customer relationships. As a result, the depreciation and amortization charges are and will be higher than the simple addition of historical D&A. 
At closing, we also replaced TWC employee stock awards with Charter stock awards. The postclosing vesting of these awards increased the stock compensation by reflecting the fair value of these replacement stock awards at closing instead of their original grant value. We also booked a number of merger and restructuring expenses in the other operating expense line, including onetime contingencies at close for transaction advisory, including legal, M&A advisory at both TWC and Charter and financing fees; and employee severance expenses of roughly $300 million, nearly half of which came from the accelerated vesting of stock at the now stepped-up purchase price value. And the rationalization of 3 corporate groups will likely take a year, and so we expect to continue to see severance in the other operating expenses line for several quarters.
Postclosing, we announced a new retirement program across the company, which is designed to be competitive in the marketplace and give employees more control over their retirement funds through a higher-defined contribution match. The Bright House defined benefit plan had already been frozen by Advance/Newhouse at just prior to close and remains with Advance/Newhouse. However, as part of the new retirement program at Charter, we recorded a onetime curtailment gain when we announced in June that we'll freeze the TWC benefit plan -- defined benefit plan at the end of August. For those who are interested, this means using the ABO instead of the PBO when measuring the net liability. 
Purchase price accounting also resulted in a step-up in the value of acquired TWC debt to its fair market value as its closing date. The premium between the fair value of closing and the principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt, driving GAAP interest expense well below cash interest expense. Our run rate annualized cash interest expense is $3.3 billion, whereas, the Q2 pro forma P&L interest expense would suggest a $2.9 billion annual run rate.
We refinanced an existing Charter debt in the quarter, driving charges in the lost on extinguishment of debt line. The loss of financial instruments lines reflects a onetime termination expense for TWC's interest rate swaps and a change in valuation of legacy TWC British pound debt and related currency swaps. 
Turning to tax expense. Nearly all of the $3.3 billion valuation allowance against legacy Charter's deferred tax assets was removed given the greater visibility and certainty around the use of legacy Charter's NOLs on our consolidated tax return. That drove a onetime tax benefit of nearly $3.2 billion in the quarter. 
We're also now expensing a quarterly charge of approximately $338 million in preferred coupon for Advance/Newhouse's preferred partnership units. That charge is being reported on a separate line as noncontrolling interest expense along with backing out that portion of consolidated net income attributable to Advance/Newhouse's common partnership units.
Finally, as you review our trending schedules, keep in mind that all customer and passings data that you see are based on legacy company definitions. In a few quarters' time, we'll recast the customer data and the trending schedules using the same set of common definitions. When we do that, the goal will be to recast all historical data as well. And until then, certain data like net adds and ARPU, they remain relevant for legacy entity trends, but they're less helpful when comparing one entity to another. 
So moving on to Q2. Although second quarter results really just reflect the sum of 3 different operating strategies, I wanted to provide some high-level commentary on our second quarter customer and financial results on a pro forma basis. Total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, 4.8% at TWC, 6.3% at Charter and 4.1% at Bright House. During the second quarter, in which Bright House Florida seasonals amplify the normal second quarter cable seasonality, we grew residential PSUs by 167,000 versus 201,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, in particular due to a low-price voice offering in TWC markets in Q2 of last year. 
In residential video, over the last year, TWC was essentially flat on subscribers, Charter grew by 1% video and Bright House lost 3.6%. Quarterly video net losses improved year-over-year at both Bright House and at legacy Charter while TWC's video net loss was 28,000 worse than last year primarily driven by an increase in churn. In total for Q2, we lost 152,000 residential video customers, of which about half came from normal video, normal Florida seasonal downgrades. That loss is an improvement to a loss of 170,000 total video customers in Q2 pro forma last year. 
In Residential Internet, we added a total of 236,000 customers in the quarter versus 157,000 last year. And our total Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.5% over the past year.
In voice, we grew customers by 83,000 versus 214,000 last year, really driven by the difference in offers in the marketplace at TWC and the higher amount of single-play Internet sell-in at Bright House. 
Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million customers or by 4.8%. In the same period, residential ARPU was up by about 1%. 
And as Slide 14 shows, our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 5.6%. Excluding pay-per-view revenue, which included the Mayweather-Pacquiao event in Q2 of 2015 for all 3 companies, consolidated residential revenue grew by 6.3% and consolidated residential ARPU by 1.7%. 
Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 13.4%. At legacy Charter, we introduced new pricing and packaging at both SMB and enterprise last year, and we're seeing the significant increase in sales and net adds we expected. We intend to make similar changes to legacy TWC and Bright House SMB and enterprise by next year. 
Finally, advertising was up 3.9% with political revenue growth accounting for about half of the $15 million growth year-over-year. In total, second quarter pro forma revenue was up by 6.6% year-over-year or 7.2%, excluding pay-per-view. 
Looking at total revenue growth at each of our legacy companies, including the effect of less boxing pay-per-view, TWC revenue grew by 7.2%. Although excluding the recognition of revenue associated with settlements of a contractual dispute, revenue grew by 6.8%. Legacy Charter grew by 6.7% or 7% when excluding a onetime charge for customer credits in the quarter. And Bright House revenue grew by 3.3% or 3.0% when excluding the benefit from the same settled dispute at TWC.
Turning to fourth quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 15. We've generally mapped all TWC and Bright House operating expenses to legacy Charter's expense categories, although there will likely be some expense remapping in subsequent quarters. On a pro forma basis, total operating expenses grew by $326 million or 5.3% year-over-year in line with total residential and SMB customer growth of 5.1% with transition expense accounting for $25 million of our total OpEx this quarter. 
Programming increased 7.5% year-on-year driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by lower pay-per-view cost. Looking at programming this quarter really is not that representative as we had a big quarter closing that drove recurring benefits in the Q2 subperiod, but we also had a number of onetime nonrecurring charges at legacy Charter, including some fees which were contingent on closing. As a conforming accounting policy, we've also reclassed ad buy obligations to add revenue instead of contra expense to programming on the TWC side of the ledger. Net-net, I expect our programming line item and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by the end of this year. 
Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were virtually flat year-over-year and benefit from the purchased accounting adjustment made to the Dodgers contract that I mentioned earlier. Costs to service customers grew by 2.1% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which really reflects the significantly lower service transactions at legacy Charter. 
And other expenses grew by 8.5% driven by higher corporate administrative labor cost, again, on a pro forma basis, including preclosing bonus accrual true-ups, higher IT resources at legacy TWC, advertising sales cost and enterprises sales and labor costs, partly offset by overhead reductions, which only started in June. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash share-based compensation, grew by 9%. Excluding transition cost, adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.2%. There were clearly a lot of moving pieces this quarter, but from an accounting treatment perspective as well as nonrecurring items -- but excluding that noise, the pro forma growth rate was probably more in the 7% to 8% range. And as we make the changes Tom laid out, there'll be a lot of activity impacting the financials through different subscriber vintages until we have a consistent product and service across our entire footprint.
Bigger picture is legacy Charter EBITDA growth for April and May, without any synergy benefit, was well into double-digit growth, reflecting the benefits of our operating model and what we intend to do with a larger set of assets long term. 
Due to the mid-quarter closing of our transaction, there's little to talk about with respect to realized operating cost synergies in our Q2 results. We do, however, expect synergies to materialize in the second half of this year and will highlight estimates of what's in the quarter going forward. We've already concretely identified run rate annualized transaction-related operating expense synergies of over $600 million by the first anniversary of close. And we expect our initial synergy outline of $800 million per year by year 3 will be exceeded.
At Charter, we define transaction synergies as those which result purely from the combination of the companies. They do not reflect operating synergies, which come from operating decisions and investments that increase revenue and lower service transaction costs. 
Turning to Slide 16 where we share both pro forma and actual net income for the second quarter. Our actual second quarter income statement reflects legacy Charter's results up to May 18, plus the results of the 3 legacy entities from May 18 through June 30. It also includes onetime expenses that are directly tied to the closing of the transactions. 
Conversely, the pro forma P&L assumes the 3 legacy entities have been one company and excludes onetime expenses and benefits that are directly tied to closing of the transactions. The background I provided on purchase accounting earlier and the detailed schedule on Slide 16 should help people understand the P&L down to net income on both a natural basis and on a pro forma basis. 
On our actual P&L, the biggest driver of net income is clearly the onetime benefit of the valuation allowance release of $3.3 billion. With TWC and Bright House income, the timing and visibility of utilizing our NOLs on a consolidated tax return is no longer uncertain from an accounting perspective. The noncontrolling interest expense line will be a recurring charge on our income statement as long as Advance/Newhouse holds an interest in the partnership. 
Turning to Slide 17. Pro forma capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, including $111 million of transition capital expenditures. Excluding transition CapEx, our second quarter CapEx was up by $137 million or 7.5% year-over-year driven primarily by the TWC Maxx all-digital initiative but looks to be some pull forward spend on CMTS and network routers at TWC preclose in the scalable infrastructure line, investments in product development at both Charter and TWC, which also falls in scalable infrastructure, as well as previous leasehold improvement and real estate investments at TWC, including data center, warehousing and head end initiatives, which were booked in support capital. 
In Q2, excluding transition capital, TWC spent capital of approximately 21%, Charter 18% and Bright House 15% of revenue, respectively. Going forward, obviously we'll reduce the spend on IT, product development and other areas which were, by definition, duplicative. And we should see a short-term benefit from the regrouping on the remaining all-digital projects, as Tom outlined.
Slide 18 shows the actual free cash flow we generated in the second quarter and only reflects legacy Charter's results through May 17, plus the results of the 3 legacy entities from May 18 to June 30. 
Finally, turning to our tax assets on Slide 19. At the closing of our transactions and as expected, we had a change in ownership as per Section 382 of the IRS code, which re-restricted the availability of our NOLs. We believe the net present value of our tax assets was not impaired. The transactions create a larger base of taxable income, ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus their utilization pace at legacy Charter. 
Today, we're providing a preliminary updated NOL availability schedule, which you can see at the bottom of the left -- bottom left-hand side of this slide. As the chart shows, we expect the vast majority of our $11.5 billion of our NOLs will be available for use by the end of 2018. As of now, we don't expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income, excluding the impact of higher depreciation and amortization from purchase price accounting, should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom."

And if you just take the Charter growth strategy and apply it to a much bigger set of assets and you do the same thing on those assets, get the same kind of growth rates, you create a lot of value. But the other part of scale that comes out of this is that the footprint, the coverage of the DMA and our ability to use mass advertising as well as sell advertising in DMA is improved by the efficiency of our coverage of local markets, meaning in historic terms, we're better clustered. So we have our ownership of assets by particular DMA more concentrated than we did at Charter. That gives you 2 things. It gives you the opportunity to be a better seller of services and products, and it gives you the opportunity to be a better seller of advertising and targeted advertising in local products sold at -- on all the various platforms: the TV, the Internet and voice platforms, wireless platforms. And it also gives you, from a commercial sales perspective, a more likely footprint to serve medium-sized businesses and all the facilities those businesses path or use within your footprint.

So we need to make sure that we have an advanced video product in every market where we launch pricing and packaging, that our data speeds can be taken up to where they need to be. So -- and it's logistically complex but not that disruptive to the consumer. What is disruptive to the consumer, though, is continued all-digital rollouts. That requires hardware going into consumer homes. So about 40% of Time Warner assets are not all-digital currently, and 50% of Bright House are not all-digital. So those transactions are disruptive -- more disruptive but necessary in order to get you in a place where you have a superior product set relative to all your competitors. If you look at the history of Charter and its growth rate and its trending schedules, as you'd inquire about, they're a good proxy for what we expect to happen going forward in these new assets. The difference in these assets is that, physically, they're in better shape, so there's probably less capital required in them. But from a consumer perspective and driving revenue and driving consumer stats, the Charter experience is a good proxy. With regard to your question on the guide, yes, there are some issues around the guide in rolling it out in the new assets, and they have to do with provisioning systems. So you have 3 different companies that talk to their hardware modems, voice devices as well as TV set-top boxes and create the billing environment and the control environment around all of that hardware in the field as well as the billing environment that goes over top of that. All those are things are separate functions that have to be integrated and require an IT infrastructure over top of all of the existing legacy's structures to unify what products can go where. And the guide, to some extent, has to wait for that physical infrastructure to get put in place. So we think we can do that as we roll out the all-digital strategy, and we don't think it's gating or anything like that. But it takes time, and it's complicated."

What you're getting at is actually really complex because of all the different transactions that are involved, but I'll try to simplify it a little bit. There was a higher amount of churn at legacy TWC in Q2. A lot of that was also coming from downgrades at that point where you have promotional pricing rolloff. That's a function of not having the highest-quality product that you could offer in place at the best price you could offer and making it competitive in the marketplace and not having a consistent way of rolling the pricing up at promotion, which means essentially that the product doesn't stick. So in terms of going forward, the more of the base that you can get on pricing and packaging, the more sticky that base becomes, not only in the face of competition but also in the context of step-up in price. But you're still exposed along the wave of the legacy base that hasn't migrated to new pricing and packaging as to what happens to them at rolloffs, what you allow them to roll off to, what retention offers you have in place, and how quickly you can either proactively or reactively migrate that base into the new pricing and packaging. It's fairly complex, no different that what was done at legacy Charter in the 2012 to 2014 time period. So we'll just manage through it the same way that we did then."

How are you thinking about marketing video to them maybe in a way that hasn't been done before either at scale or in the industry? Anything at this point that you're thinking about from a product offering or technology perspective to sort of get at that opportunity? And Chris, if you go back to the expense growth in the quarter, I think you gave us pro forma growth for programming, cost to serve and other of like 7.5%, 2% and 8.5% but there's a lot, as you point out, a lot of moving pieces there. Is there a way to think about either clean versions of those 3 numbers or even directionally whether the sort of real underlying trend is higher or lower than these metrics you gave in the release just as we think about sort of the natural cost growth trend of the business through the rest of this year. Any color would be helpful if you had any."

If you look at those 7 million data-only subs, a substantial portion of them are satellite customers. And that has to do with the analog nature of the video product that the cable companies sell. And by going all-digital and using your 2-way interactive platform, you can build a better video product than your competitors, in my opinion, which is why I think Charter is growing its video business year-over-year. It's a slow process. The inertia is real in the marketplace. But it's -- I think Charter has turned the video business positively. And I think the same is possible in Time Warner and Bright House. But it requires the proper investment in a video product, which means you need a 2-way product with an excellent user interface and all the functionality and features that you get from an Internet type like service with live fully-featured content. So I think there's still lots of upside selling traditional MVPD products at cable service to customers who have broadband only. That said, there is an income issue with television. It's very expensive to buy the whole package. It's hard to sell smaller packages that resonate in the market and are sticky and satisfy consumers. And various marketing tactics have been tried to skinny down the product. The problem is skinny-ing it down to the right place with the right package and satisfying people who are financially challenged. And we'll continue to explore relationships with content companies to do that. But I also think that you can make a fully featured service more attractive and more worth what it does cost. And we can use that to drive into the marketplace."

Programming, we only had half a quarter, in essence",468,"On the expense side, Ben, I don't want to get into the mode of providing guidance, but based on what I've already said, I think you can deduce a few things going through the 3 categories that you listed. Programming, we only had half a quarter, in essence, of Charter being in a closed status, and in addition to that, your had a number of onetime bad guys at legacy Charter, some of which was contingencies that are going to be paid on closing to programmers. So by definition, that means that, that result improves. Going against that grain over time is that if you're putting a rich video product into the marketplace and you're selling more expanded, as Tom was talking about, that's not rate-based growth. That's programming. That's volume-based that's accompanied by higher revenue and less churn. So we look at the transaction piece of that as rate versus volume. The second piece that you highlighted was cost to serve where the cost to serve is really benefiting from the significant operating synergies that exist at legacy Charter as a result of having a simpler product in the marketplace for customers knowing that when you step up rate, that is a fair rate and not keep continuing to keep on calling in to do a deal reduces your call volume, reduces your churn, and the insourced labor also being a key function as well. And going the other way, so that's at legacy Charter, which is really helping the results. We're going to be continuing to -- we're going to continue to insource at TWC and Bright House. It's going to create some of the same pressures that we saw at Charter in the cost to serve line at the beginning as we insource a labor force that needs to be trained up and you have parallel outsource resource in place while you're doing that. So it's going to be dynamic as we go. And for the other category, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this includes corporate advertising, enterprise and from -- particularly from a corporate perspective, a lot of the headcount reductions didn't really occur or begin to occur until June, and those will be continuing on for some time. So there should be some improvements in that line item on a go-forward basis. And then, look, our goal here is even if it cost us a little bit more by putting a richer product in place on programming or whether it costs us more upfront to put insourcing in place for cost to serve and things like IT and whatnot is to generate operating leverage at the back end by being able to scale it up front and reduce transactions over time and make more of the revenue flow through to EBITDA."

There was also some, what I believe is pull forward of good capital -- significant pull forward of capital around CMTS and routers and some of that type of activity that should slow down a little bit as well. But the danger in providing CapEx guidance or even expectations is, frankly, as we see the opportunity to go make an investment that's going to put the company in a position to grow faster, then we're going to do that inside of a particular quarter or inside of a particular last 12 months or fiscal year. And our view on the trends of CapEx is that capital intensity will go down significantly once we get through the all-digital program. But from a timing perspective, we see opportunities grow faster by investing quicker, even though the total gross dollars invested may not be any different, we'll pull it forward as we need to, and we don't want to be beholden to slowing down the growth trajectory of the company to meet what is, in our view, kind of an artificial target. So no, we won't be providing an outlook for this year. But I think if you take a look at the way that we've managed capital in the past at Charter, it's meant to be efficient and to drive faster growth."

On May 18, we closed our transaction with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint, giving us the local and national scale to innovate and grow faster",1053,"Thanks, Stefan. On May 18, we closed our transaction with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, creating a new company with a bigger and a significantly more concentrated footprint, giving us the local and national scale to innovate and grow faster. Our high-capacity network now reaches nearly 49 million homes and businesses, and we have over 25 million residential and business customers in attractive markets. Our ability to use mass media effectively has increased from approximately 50% of passings at legacy Charter to the mid-90% range today. This gives us better local sales, marketing and branding capabilities, service delivery and field operations, efficiencies and a greater ability to reach and serve medium- and long-term -- excuse me, medium and large commercial customers. 
The new scale will accelerate video and advanced advertising product development and deepen our wireless service offerings over time. There are also meaningful onetime transaction synergies which will prove higher than previously outlined. Nevertheless, the execution of Charter's high-growth customer-focused operating strategy across a larger service footprint remains the largest contributor to shareholder value in our plans. 
Since the close, we found what we thought we would and we put in place a single centralized operating and financial control structure. We're standardizing our business practices and processes, including the IT service infrastructure, which will be completed over the next 2-plus years as well as our products, pricing and packaging across all of our regions over the next year. And finally, we'll continue to develop and launch new products and services, which position Charter for long-term growth. 
At closing, all of our employees were mapped to their respective business units and executives based on our operating model. Today, the bulk of our 90,000-plus employees remain in the field inside our operating regions and call centers. 
We've already begun insourcing efforts for the new company. The process of insourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people, train them and equip them with trucks, tools and test equipment, and house them in new and expanded facilities. That process has already started as we are building Charter's first Spanish-language call center in McAllen, Texas, with approximately 600 seats. Ultimately, with a more local workforce, we'll perform higher-quality transactions with customers, which we expect will improve customer satisfaction, reduce transactions and costs, and extend average customer lives, thereby growing our customer base and cash flow efficiently. 
In the fall, we'll begin to rebrand Time Warner Cable and Bright House and launch our Spectrum pricing and packaging in a number of key markets totaling over 40% of our acquired passings with the remainder in the first half of 2017. On the small and medium business side, we'll launch the full-spectrum small business product pricing and packaging in TWC and Bright House markets in early and mid-2017. 
In 2017, the all-digital project at Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets will use the Charter all-digital strategy, which uses fully functioning 2-way set-top boxes with Video On Demand and advanced guide functionality on every TV outlet. We expect the project to be completed by 2018. We will also extend our practice of performing electronic connections instead of physical truck rolls as we go all digital, allowing us to fully scale our self-installation and self-service practices. 
Our plan is to have Spectrum Guide available in most legacy Charter markets by the end of this year. We will launch Spectrum Guide in TWC's larger markets by the middle of 2017 and other TWC and Bright House markets following through the year and likely continuing through 2018 as we complete the all-digital project. 
Now that we're closed, we're running a WiFi network in public spaces throughout the country as well as on a widely distributed indoor terrestrial wireless network, which combined with MVNO opportunities and other wireless building blocks, should allow us to create products and services with a high value proposition. Over time, we'll have more to discuss on this subject. 
Chris will cover the second quarter results in more detail in a moment. But the overview is that legacy Charter continued to perform very well in the quarter with better subscriber growth than the prior year. And on a stand-alone basis through closing, legacy Charter continued to show double-digit and improving EBITDA growth. 
Bright House also improved its customer performance year-over-year. While Bright House has benefited from Frontier's acquisition of certain FiOS properties, it should be noted that because most of its footprint is in Florida, it is subject to greater second quarter seasonality than both Charter and Time Warner Cable. 
Legacy Time Warner Cable is in better shape than just a couple of years ago with growth in customer relationships. During the second quarter last year, Time Warner had a very aggressive voice promotion, making voice net add comparisons with this third quarter negative. However, our second quarter pro forma results have to be seen in context because they reflect the continuation of previous operating strategies, much of which are different from our plan. 
Through different metrics and stages of development, we can see that TWC and, more recently, Bright House, have both become reliant on rate increases and retention offers, each of which has various short- and long-term effects, including encouraging customers to initiate more transactions. We've addressed these types of issues at legacy Charter and will do so at TWC and Bright House during the Spectrum pricing and packaging migration. 
Generally though, we're very pleased with how TWC and Bright House manage the assets through closing. Our pro forma total customer relationships increased by 173,000 during the second quarter compared to 54,000 last year, and our year-over-year pro forma revenue growth of 6.6% and pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% in Q2 demonstrates the health of our business. 
We will make the necessary investments using the same approach we used at Charter to put the new assets on the right long-term growth strategy. The big difference today is that we have an established management team with experience running our operating plan. And TWC and Bright House are in better condition than legacy Charter was 4 years ago. And we have meaningful transaction synergies, which will help offset short-term effects in investments we need to make to create long-run operating momentum in the marketplace. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chris."

I'll largely focus on pro forma results as comparisons to prior year actuals aren't helpful given the size of the transactions. Before going there though, I think it makes sense to set the baseline for the new company by walking back through the basic building blocks. 
On Slide 8, you should see a summary sources and uses statement for the transactions. On the left-hand side of the slide, under Sources, you can see that the amount of debt that we issued for our transactions totaled approximately $23.8 billion, composed of $21.8 billion for the TWC transaction and $2 billion for the Bright House transaction. We also assumed approximately $22.5 billion principal value of TWC investment-grade debt already in place. And we issued approximately $33 billion in Charter stock to legacy TWC shareholders valued at the closing date, about $10.2 billion to Advance/Newhouse in the form of preferred and common partnership units also valued at the closing date, and $5 billion in stock to Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive in exchange for cash valued at the signing of the deals, all totaling about $96 billion in sources and uses for our transactions. And other than the impact of a higher Charter share price at closing, the sources and uses were essentially as we outlined at signing. 
From the beginning, we carefully structured our transactions with TWC and Bright House in order to achieve a number of operating, tax and financing objectives. By providing pari passu bank loan security to investment-grade bondholders, we now have access to virtually all pockets of the debt markets, including long-dated, low-cost financing without separate financing silos. The debt we issued to finance our transactions was placed in the investment-grade market, the term loan market and in the high-yield market. And as Slide 9 indicates, our total debt outstanding now stands at just over $60 billion compared to our June 30 market cap of approximately $71 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 5.5%, 87% of which is fixed with an average maturity of 11.5 years and close to 90% due after 2019. 
Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, which revalued assumed TWC debt to fair market value on the balance sheet, our total net debt to last 12-month pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.4x. It was 4.2x pro forma for year 1 run rate synergy estimates. Our target leverage range remains at 4 to 4.5x, and we'll target the lower end of that range. We've also committed to remain at 3.5x or below at the first-inning level or at CCO and maintain eligibility for inclusion in the investment-grade index. 
Given our EBITDA growth profile and positive cash flow, we expect to delever rapidly, providing us with excess capacity relative to our leverage targets. We could use that excess capacity in a number of ways, but in order of priority, we'll invest in our business, including areas that provide faster and more sustainable growth; pursue accretive M&A when available and ready; return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases; and if we had no better use of cash or determine it prudent to reduce our target leverage, we'll pay down debt. 
Turning to our ownership structure. Slide 10 shows, as of June 30, public shareholders held 68% of Charter. Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive together have an economic ownership stake in Charter of approximately 19%. On an as-converted and as-exchange basis of its partnership units, Advance/Newhouse held an economic stake in Charter of approximately 13% and had governance through its corresponding B share at the corporate level. 
We currently have 13 board members composed of 8 unaffiliated board members, including Tom, our Chairman; 3 Liberty-related board members; and 2 Advance/Newhouse affiliated board members. 
On the right-hand side of 10, Slide 10, you'll see that, at closing, Charter had approximately 270 million shares outstanding. However, including the impact of the Advance/Newhouse fully converting and exchanging its common and preferred partnership units, Charter's outstanding shares totaled 311 million. Those partnership units are exchangeable at any time, so it makes sense for investors to include those partnership units on an as-converted and as-exchanged basis when evaluating Charter's total equity value in most share-based metrics. Some outlets continue to only look at the outstanding shares, which drives large differences in reported market capitalization.
Turning to the presentation of our financials on Slide 11. This slide lists some of the key transaction-related accounting items, some of which are onetime in nature. Starting with revenue at the top of the slide, our pro forma results eliminate a number of revenue items, including within legacy TWC revenue, the management fee from Bright House that previously existed; and in consolidation, affiliate fees for the Dodgers and Lakers RSNs that TWC received from Charter and Bright House. Additionally, certain items like late fees, which were previously classified as contra-expense at TWC and Bright House, have been reclassified into revenue at each legacy entity. 
Turning to operating expenses. We've made the same revenue-related reclasses and mapped TWC and Bright House expenses into our operating model. We've also conformed accounting policies across the 3 companies with the largest difference being the level of capitalization at Bright House, as expected. For legacy TWC, we also moved both gains from sale of fixed assets and noncash share-based compensation below adjusted EBITDA. And under purchase price accounting, we've posted a liability on our balance sheet to reflect an estimate of the out-of-market portion of TWC's RSN distribution agreement with the Dodgers. 
While there's no change to the cash payments, the P&L expense associated with the rights fee was already lower in Q2. That expense is included in the regulatory connectivity and produced content line on our P&L. 
Below the adjusted EBITDA line, there were also a number of items to note. For purchase price accounting, we stepped up the value of TWC and Bright House assets on our balance sheet to fair market value, including PP&E and customer relationships. As a result, the depreciation and amortization charges are and will be higher than the simple addition of historical D&A. 
At closing, we also replaced TWC employee stock awards with Charter stock awards. The postclosing vesting of these awards increased the stock compensation by reflecting the fair value of these replacement stock awards at closing instead of their original grant value. We also booked a number of merger and restructuring expenses in the other operating expense line, including onetime contingencies at close for transaction advisory, including legal, M&A advisory at both TWC and Charter and financing fees; and employee severance expenses of roughly $300 million, nearly half of which came from the accelerated vesting of stock at the now stepped-up purchase price value. And the rationalization of 3 corporate groups will likely take a year, and so we expect to continue to see severance in the other operating expenses line for several quarters.
Postclosing, we announced a new retirement program across the company, which is designed to be competitive in the marketplace and give employees more control over their retirement funds through a higher-defined contribution match. The Bright House defined benefit plan had already been frozen by Advance/Newhouse at just prior to close and remains with Advance/Newhouse. However, as part of the new retirement program at Charter, we recorded a onetime curtailment gain when we announced in June that we'll freeze the TWC benefit plan -- defined benefit plan at the end of August. For those who are interested, this means using the ABO instead of the PBO when measuring the net liability. 
Purchase price accounting also resulted in a step-up in the value of acquired TWC debt to its fair market value as its closing date. The premium between the fair value of closing and the principal amount will amortize over the remaining term of each tranche of debt, driving GAAP interest expense well below cash interest expense. Our run rate annualized cash interest expense is $3.3 billion, whereas, the Q2 pro forma P&L interest expense would suggest a $2.9 billion annual run rate.
We refinanced an existing Charter debt in the quarter, driving charges in the loss on extinguishment of debt line. The loss of financial instruments lines reflects a onetime termination expense for TWC's interest rate swaps and a change in valuation of legacy TWC British pound debt and related currency swaps. 
Turning to tax expense. Nearly all of the $3.3 billion valuation allowance against legacy Charter's deferred tax assets was removed given the greater visibility and certainty around the use of legacy Charter's NOLs on our consolidated tax return. That drove a onetime tax benefit of nearly $3.2 billion in the quarter. 
We're also now expensing a quarterly charge of approximately $338 million in preferred coupon for Advance/Newhouse's preferred partnership units. That charge is being reported on a separate line as noncontrolling interest expense along with backing out that portion of consolidated net income attributable to Advance/Newhouse's common partnership units.
Finally, as you review our trending schedules, keep in mind that all customer and passings data that you see are based on legacy company definitions. In a few quarters' time, we'll recast the customer data and the trending schedules using the same set of common definitions. When we do that, the goal will be to recast all historical data as well. And until then, certain data like net adds and ARPU, they remain relevant for legacy entity trends, but they're less helpful when comparing one entity to another. 
So moving on to Q2. Although second quarter results really just reflect the sum of 3 different operating strategies, I wanted to provide some high-level commentary on our second quarter customer and financial results on a pro forma basis. Total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, 4.8% at TWC, 6.3% at Charter and 4.1% at Bright House. During the second quarter, in which Bright House Florida seasonals amplify the normal second quarter cable seasonality, we grew residential PSUs by 167,000 versus 201,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, in particular due to a low-price voice offering in TWC markets in Q2 of last year. 
In residential video, over the last year, TWC was essentially flat on subscribers, Charter grew by 1% video and Bright House lost 3.6%. Quarterly video net losses improved year-over-year at both Bright House and at legacy Charter while TWC's video net loss was 28,000 worse than last year primarily driven by an increase in churn. In total for Q2, we lost 152,000 residential video customers, of which about half came from normal video, normal Florida seasonal downgrades. That loss is an improvement to a loss of 170,000 total video customers in Q2 pro forma last year. 
In Residential Internet, we added a total of 236,000 customers in the quarter versus 157,000 last year. And our total Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.5% over the past year.
In voice, we grew customers by 83,000 versus 214,000 last year, really driven by the difference in offers in the marketplace at TWC and the higher amount of single-play Internet sell-in at Bright House. 
Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million customers or by 4.8%. In the same period, residential ARPU was up by about 1%. 
And as Slide 14 shows, our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 5.6%. Excluding pay-per-view revenue, which included the Mayweather-Pacquiao event in Q2 of 2015 for all 3 companies, consolidated residential revenue grew by 6.3% and consolidated residential ARPU by 1.7%. 
Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 13.4%. At legacy Charter, we introduced new pricing and packaging at both SMB and enterprise last year, and we're seeing the significant increase in sales and net adds we expected. We intend to make similar changes to legacy TWC and Bright House SMB and enterprise by next year. 
Finally, advertising was up 3.9% with political revenue growth accounting for about half of the $15 million growth year-over-year. In total, second quarter pro forma revenue was up by 6.6% year-over-year or 7.2%, excluding pay-per-view. 
Looking at total revenue growth at each of our legacy companies, including the effect of less boxing pay-per-view, TWC revenue grew by 7.2%. Although excluding the recognition of revenue associated with settlements of a contractual dispute, revenue grew by 6.8%. Legacy Charter grew by 6.7% or 7% when excluding a onetime charge for customer credits in the quarter. And Bright House revenue grew by 3.3% or 3.0% when excluding the benefit from the same settled dispute at TWC.
Turning to fourth quarter operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 15. We've generally mapped all TWC and Bright House operating expenses to legacy Charter's expense categories, although there will likely be some expense remapping in subsequent quarters. On a pro forma basis, total operating expenses grew by $326 million or 5.3% year-over-year in line with total residential and SMB customer growth of 5.1% with transition expense accounting for $25 million of our total OpEx this quarter. 
Programming increased 7.5% year-on-year driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by lower pay-per-view cost. Looking at programming this quarter really is not that representative as we had a big quarter closing that drove recurring benefits in the Q2 subperiod, but we also had a number of onetime nonrecurring charges at legacy Charter, including some fees which were contingent on closing. As a conforming accounting policy, we've also reclassed ad buy obligations to add revenue instead of contra expense to programming on the TWC side of the ledger. Net-net, I expect our programming line item and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by the end of this year. 
Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were virtually flat year-over-year and benefit from the purchased accounting adjustment made to the Dodgers contract that I mentioned earlier. Costs to service customers grew by 2.1% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which really reflects the significantly lower service transactions at legacy Charter. 
And other expenses grew by 8.5% driven by higher corporate administrative labor cost, again, on a pro forma basis, including preclosing bonus accrual true-ups, higher IT resources at legacy TWC, advertising sales cost and enterprises sales and labor costs, partly offset by overhead reductions, which only started in June. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash share-based compensation, grew by 9%. Excluding transition cost, adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.2%. There were clearly a lot of moving pieces this quarter, but from an accounting treatment perspective as well as nonrecurring items -- but excluding that noise, the pro forma growth rate was probably more in the 7% to 8% range. And as we make the changes Tom laid out, there'll be a lot of activity impacting the financials through different subscriber vintages until we have a consistent product and service across our entire footprint.
Bigger picture is legacy Charter EBITDA growth for April and May, without any synergy benefit, was well into double-digit growth, reflecting the benefits of our operating model and what we intend to do with a larger set of assets long term. 
Due to the mid-quarter closing of our transaction, there's little to talk about with respect to realized operating cost synergies in our Q2 results. We do, however, expect synergies to materialize in the second half of this year and will highlight estimates of what's in the quarter going forward. We've already concretely identified run rate annualized transaction-related operating expense synergies of over $600 million by the first anniversary of close. And we expect our initial synergy outline of $800 million per year by year 3 will be exceeded.
At Charter, we define transaction synergies as those which result purely from the combination of the companies. They do not reflect operating synergies, which come from operating decisions and investments that increase revenue and lower service transaction costs. 
Turning to Slide 16 where we share both pro forma and actual net income for the second quarter. Our actual second quarter income statement reflects legacy Charter's results up to May 18, plus the results of the 3 legacy entities from May 18 through June 30. It also includes onetime expenses that are directly tied to the closing of the transactions. 
Conversely, the pro forma P&L assumes the 3 legacy entities have been one company and excludes onetime expenses and benefits that are directly tied to closing of the transactions. The background I provided on purchase accounting earlier and the detailed schedule on Slide 16 should help people understand the P&L down to net income on both a natural basis and on a pro forma basis. 
On our actual P&L, the biggest driver of net income is clearly the onetime benefit of the valuation allowance release of $3.3 billion. With TWC and Bright House income, the timing and visibility of utilizing our NOLs on a consolidated tax return is no longer uncertain from an accounting perspective. The noncontrolling interest expense line will be a recurring charge on our income statement as long as Advance/Newhouse holds an interest in the partnership. 
Turning to Slide 17. Pro forma capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, including $111 million of transition capital expenditures. Excluding transition CapEx, our second quarter CapEx was up by $137 million or 7.5% year-over-year driven primarily by the TWC Maxx all-digital initiative but looks to be some pull forward spend on CMTS and network routers at TWC preclose in the scalable infrastructure line, investments in product development at both Charter and TWC, which also falls in scalable infrastructure, as well as previous leasehold improvement and real estate investments at TWC, including data center, warehousing and head end initiatives, which were booked in support capital. 
In Q2, excluding transition capital, TWC spent capital of approximately 21%, Charter 18% and Bright House 15% of revenue, respectively. Going forward, obviously we'll reduce the spend on IT, product development and other areas which were, by definition, duplicative. And we should see a short-term benefit from the regrouping on the remaining all-digital projects, as Tom outlined.
Slide 18 shows the actual free cash flow we generated in the second quarter and only reflects legacy Charter's results through May 17, plus the results of the 3 legacy entities from May 18 to June 30. 
Finally, turning to our tax assets on Slide 19. At the closing of our transactions and as expected, we had a change in ownership as per Section 382 of the IRS code, which re-restricted the availability of our NOLs. We believe the net present value of our tax assets was not impaired. The transactions create a larger base of taxable income, ultimately accelerating the utilization of our NOLs versus their utilization pace at legacy Charter. 
Today, we're providing a preliminary updated NOL availability schedule, which you can see at the bottom of the left -- bottom left-hand side of this slide. As the chart shows, we expect the vast majority of our $11.5 billion of our NOLs will be available for use by the end of 2018. As of now, we don't expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019. And even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income, excluding the impact of higher depreciation and amortization from purchase price accounting, should be below statutory rates for several years thereafter. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom."

And if you just take the Charter growth strategy and apply it to a much bigger set of assets and you do the same thing on those assets, get the same kind of growth rates, you create a lot of value. But the other part of scale that comes out of this is that the footprint, the coverage of the DMA and our ability to use mass advertising as well as sell advertising in DMA is improved by the efficiency of our coverage of local markets, meaning in historic terms, we're better clustered. So we have our ownership of assets by particular DMA more concentrated than we did at Charter. That gives you 2 things. It gives you the opportunity to be a better seller of services and products, and it gives you the opportunity to be a better seller of advertising and targeted advertising in local products sold at -- on all the various platforms: the TV, the Internet and voice platforms, wireless platforms. And it also gives you, from a commercial sales perspective, a more likely footprint to serve medium-sized businesses and all the facilities those businesses path or use within your footprint.

So we need to make sure that we have an advanced video product in every market where we launch pricing and packaging, that our data speeds can be taken up to where they need to be. So -- and it's logistically complex but not that disruptive to the consumer. What is disruptive to the consumer, though, is continued all-digital rollouts. That requires hardware going into consumer homes. So about 40% of Time Warner assets are not all-digital currently, and 50% of Bright House are not all-digital. So those transactions are disruptive -- more disruptive but necessary in order to get you in a place where you have a superior product set relative to all your competitors. If you look at the history of Charter and its growth rate and its trending schedules, as you'd inquire about, they're a good proxy for what we expect to happen going forward in these new assets. The difference in these assets is that, physically, they're in better shape, so there's probably less capital required in them. But from a consumer perspective and driving revenue and driving consumer stats, the Charter experience is a good proxy. With regard to your question on the guide, yes, there are some issues around the guide in rolling it out in the new assets, and they have to do with provisioning systems. So you have 3 different companies that talk to their hardware modems, voice devices as well as TV set-top boxes and create the billing environment and the control environment around all of that hardware in the field as well as the billing environment that goes over top of that. All those are things are separate functions that have to be integrated and require an IT infrastructure over top of all of the existing legacy's structures to unify what products can go where. And the guide, to some extent, has to wait for that physical infrastructure to get put in place. So we think we can do that as we roll out the all-digital strategy, and we don't think it's gating or anything like that. But it takes time, and it's complicated."

What you're getting at is actually really complex because of all the different transactions that are involved, but I'll try to simplify it a little bit. There was a higher amount of churn at legacy TWC in Q2. A lot of that was also coming from downgrades at that point where you have promotional pricing rolloff. That's a function of not having the highest-quality product that you could offer in place at the best price you could offer and making it competitive in the marketplace and not having a consistent way of rolling the pricing up at promotion, which means essentially that the product doesn't stick. So in terms of going forward, the more of the base that you can get on pricing and packaging, the more sticky that base becomes, not only in the face of competition but also in the context of step-up in price. But you're still exposed along the wave of the legacy base that hasn't migrated to new pricing and packaging as to what happens to them at rolloffs, what you allow them to roll off to, what retention offers you have in place, and how quickly you can either proactively or reactively migrate that base into the new pricing and packaging. It's fairly complex, no different that what was done at legacy Charter in the 2012 to 2014 time period. So we'll just manage through it the same way that we did then."

Is there a way to think about either clean versions of those 3 numbers or even directionally whether the sort of real underlying trend is higher or lower than these metrics you gave in the release just as we think about sort of the natural cost growth trend of the business through the rest of this year. Any color would be helpful if you had any."

If you look at those 7 million data-only subs, a substantial portion of them are satellite customers. And that has to do with the analog nature of the video product that the cable companies sell. And by going all-digital and using your 2-way interactive platform, you can build a better video product than your competitors, in my opinion, which is why I think Charter is growing its video business year-over-year. It's a slow process. The inertia is real in the marketplace. But it's -- I think Charter has turned the video business positively. And I think the same is possible in Time Warner and Bright House. But it requires the proper investment in a video product, which means you need a 2-way product with an excellent user interface and all the functionality and features that you get from an Internet type like service with live fully-featured content. So I think there's still lots of upside selling traditional MVPD products at cable service to customers who have broadband only. That said, there is an income issue with television. It's very expensive to buy the whole package. It's hard to sell smaller packages that resonate in the market and are sticky and satisfy consumers. And various marketing tactics have been tried to skinny down the product. The problem is skinny-ing it down to the right place with the right package and satisfying people who are financially challenged. And we'll continue to explore relationships with content companies to do that. But I also think that you can make a fully featured service more attractive and more worth what it does cost. And we can use that to drive into the marketplace."

Programming, we only had half a quarter, in essence, of Charter being in a closed status, and in addition to that, your had a number of onetime bad guys at legacy Charter, some of which was contingencies that are going to be paid on closing to programmers. So by definition, that means that, that result improves. Going against that grain over time is that if you're putting a rich video product into the marketplace and you're selling more expanded, as Tom was talking about, that's not rate-based growth. That's programming. That's volume-based that's accompanied by higher revenue and less churn. So we look at the transaction piece of that as rate versus volume. The second piece that you highlighted was cost to serve where the cost to serve is really benefiting from the significant operating synergies that exist at legacy Charter as a result of having a simpler product in the marketplace for customers knowing that when you step up rate, that is a fair rate and not keep continuing to keep on calling in to do a deal reduces your call volume, reduces your churn, and the insourced labor also being a key function as well. And going the other way, so that's at legacy Charter, which is really helping the results. We're going to be continuing to -- we're going to continue to insource at TWC and Bright House. It's going to create some of the same pressures that we saw at Charter in the cost to serve line at the beginning as we insource a labor force that needs to be trained up and you have parallel outsource resource in place while you're doing that. So it's going to be dynamic as we go. And for the other category, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this includes corporate advertising, enterprise and from -- particularly from a corporate perspective, a lot of the headcount reductions didn't really occur or begin to occur until June, and those will be continuing on for some time. So there should be some improvements in that line item on a go-forward basis. And then, look, our goal here is even if it cost us a little bit more by putting a richer product in place on programming or whether it costs us more upfront to put insourcing in place for cost to serve and things like IT and whatnot is to generate operating leverage at the back end by being able to scale it up front and reduce transactions over time and make more of the revenue flow through to EBITDA."

There was also some, what I believe is pull forward of good capital -- significant pull forward of capital around CMTS and routers and some of that type of activity that should slow down a little bit as well. But the danger in providing CapEx guidance or even expectations is, frankly, as we see the opportunity to go make an investment that's going to put the company in a position to grow faster, then we're going to do that inside of a particular quarter or inside of a particular last 12 months or fiscal year. And our view on the trends of CapEx is that capital intensity will go down significantly once we get through the all-digital program. But from a timing perspective, we see opportunities grow faster by investing quicker, even though the total gross dollars invested may not be any different, we'll pull it forward as we need to, and we don't want to be beholden to slowing down the growth trajectory of the company to meet what is, in our view, kind of an artificial target. So no, we won't be providing an outlook for this year. But I think if you take a look at the way that we've managed capital in the past at Charter, it's meant to be efficient and to drive faster growth."

Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrate. In l",902,"Thank you, Stefan.
Since the closing of our transaction in May, we've been focused on quickly integrating our new assets. Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrate. In late September, we began deploying our marketing strategy in the Time Warner Cable footprint, including Texas and California. That process includes launching new service -- [ph] new pricing and packaging and the rebranding of our services as Spectrum. As a result, we're already seeing better sales in those markets.
As expected, these launches in September had a little effect on Q3 results. However, later this month, we will roll out Spectrum in our New York City and Florida markets. By year end, we will have branded over 50% of our service area as Spectrum. We expect to be through [ph] all Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets by the spring of next year with customers and financial growth benefits following over time like they have at pre-deal [ph] Charter.
On the small and medium business side, we will launch full Spectrum SMB product and pricing and packaging in Time Warner Cable and Bright House passings in mid-2017. Similar to residential, we will offer SMB products that are better than what the telcos offer at lower prices, driving customer growth in the same way we have at pre-deal Charter since launching SMB pricing and packaging in the early 2015. We're just beginning to modify business practices, policies and processes, which take time, and our goal is to avoid service disruptions. 
Insourcing 20,000 employees will require upfront investments to train, house and equip our own personnel. There'll be a period of time when the productivity of those workers will be relatively low, preventing us from immediately reducing our outsourced workforce. Over time, however, the productivity of our insourced employee base will grow and transactions will decline, allowing us to change our insourced service mix faster. So we will invest more in each customer transaction, driving higher-quality work. That higher-quality work drives transactions out of the business, lowering transaction cost per dollar [ph] of revenue and per customer relationship. The operating and financial results of our strategy have been demonstrated at pre-deal Charter, and we expect the same types of results for the new company. We'll also complete the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House over the next 2 years.
Aside from the [ph] integration, we remain focused on product and network development. Over the next 5 years or so, with relatively small infrastructure investments, our network will be able to deliver symmetrical multi-gigabit speeds with high-compute and low-latency capabilities to all 50 million homes and businesses in our footprint.
In addition to residential and SMB offerings, we will serve the enterprise marketplace with increasingly sophisticated and advanced products. The opportunity is meaningful, and our addressable footprint is approximately $20 billion of annual enterprise spend, and today, we're capturing less than 10% of that spend.
There's also a large opportunity for us in the advanced advertising space. Our 2-way interactive plant allows for highly efficient household addressability, and we're testing new platforms, which will allow advertisers to better target, measure and reach consumers at the household level.
Finally, mobility remains an area of significant opportunity for Charter and the cable industry more broadly. We are already a significant wireless provider through our in- and out-of-home WiFi footprint, and we intend to activate our MVNO agreement with Verizon. In the near term, our goals with mobility are to drive more customer growth and extend customer life by offering an attractively priced product bundle.
Over the long term, our goals will broaden. We believe there will be opportunities for us to develop new services as higher frequency Spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, becomes available. Ultimately, our goals are consistent for any new businesses that we develop, to grow our overall business more quickly and to track [ph] more shareholder value.
Before I turn the call over to Chris Winfrey who will cover the quarter in more detail, I wanted to highlight that we had a very strong quarter of financial results. We grew revenue by over 7% year-over-year and EBIT growth of over 14%, in part driven by transaction synergies, which are quickly benefiting our P&L, but also driven by the continued strength of our core operations at legacy Charter.
Third quarter customer results were more inconsistent with good performance at legacy Charter and Bright House with higher churn and downgrades from the Time Warner Cable markets, as we expected, given the way Time Warner Cable had marketed promotional pricing. Until our Spectrum pricing and packaging is launched across the newly acquired service areas, we continue to expect higher levels of churn and downgrades where Time Warner Cable is the operator.
Pre-deal Charter results continue to reflect the multiyear effect of our operating plans, including 6.2% residential and SMB customer growth over the last 12 months, with 9.7% Internet customer growth, 70,000 video net additions and 7.2% revenue growth without relying on rate increases. At the same time, service transactions and churn in those areas continue to come down.
So our growth plan is working, and our integration remains on or ahead of schedule. Nothing we have seen internally or externally has changed our optimism regarding our long-term business opportunities and growth prospects. 
Chris, I'll turn the call to you."

On our last quarter's call, I spent a lot of time discussing the effect of purchase accounting on the financials and the presentation of pro forma results. So I won't go through all that again, but last quarter's presentation and transfer regarding accounting items remain helpful to the investors.
As Tom had mentioned, [indiscernible] refer to the third quarter 2016 actual results versus prior year pro forma results as comparisons to third quarter 2015 actual service is [ph] helpful. 
The customer and passings data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on legacy company definitions. And in a full -- few quarters' time, we'll recast customer data and the trending schedules using the same common definitions. Until then, certain data like penetration and ARPU
remain relative for legacy entity trends, but they're less helpful in comparing one entity to another.
Turning to customers and PSUs. During the third quarter, total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, including 4.5% at legacy TWC, 6.2% at legacy Charter and 5.9% at legacy Bright House.
As Slide 8 shows, we grew residential PSUs by 336,000 versus 605,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was primarily driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, partly due to a low-price voice offer in TWC markets in prior year quarters, which is now resulting in higher voice downgrades and relationship churn.
Over [ph] last year, TWC residential video customers declined by about 0.5%. Pre-deal Charter grew its residential video customer base by 1.2%, and Bright House lost about 2.6% of its residential video customers. Quarterly video customer performance improved year-over-year at pre-deal Charter and at Bright House, while TWC video net loss was 54,000 worse than last year, primarily driven by an increase in video downgrade activity, given legacy pricing and packaging issues.
So in total, we lost 47,000 residential video customers in the quarter, primarily from the net losses at TWC.
In residential Internet, we added a total of 350,000 customers versus 369,000 last year. Our total residential Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.2% over the past year.
In voice, we grew customers by 33,000 versus 256,000 last year, largely driven by higher churn at TWC for the reasons I already mentioned.
Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million or by 4.8%. And over the same period, residential revenue per customer was up by about 1.8%, nearly all of which was driven by TWC rate increases early in the year and step-ups, which impacted unit growth.
Slide 9 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 6.7%.
Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 12.1%, a bit slower than last quarter, driven by lower sales charter [ph] growth and one-time benefited [ph] nano site last year.
Finally, advertising was up 12.1% and absent [ph] political advertising, revenue grew roughly 2%.
In total, third quarter pro forma revenue for the company was up 7.4% year-over-year.
Looking at total revenue growth by each of our legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 7.7%, with nearly half of residential growth still coming from rate; [ph] pre-deal Charter grew by 7.2% driven predominantly by continued customer growth; and Bright House revenue grew by 6.6% with the Florida markets continuing [ph] to do well.
Within operating expense in both current and historical periods, we've reclassified a number of operating expense items between lines. [ph] And as I mentioned last quarter, we do expect some ongoing remapping [ph] expenses as we move the expense categories to the correct business unit in our operating structure. Total operating expenses grew by $234 million or 3.8% year-over-year, with the transition expense accounting for $32 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Programming increased 8.2% year-over-year, driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by transaction synergies. I expect our programming line and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by Q4 or at least by Q1.
Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were down about 3% year-over-year, in part due to the purchase accounting adjustment made to the Dodgers contract that I discussed last quarter. The Dodgers [ph] costs are only expensed during the regular [indiscernible] both in the past and today.
Costs to service to customers declined by about 2% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which reflects lower service transactions at legacy Charter, the lack of all-digital activity at TWC this quarter versus last year's third quarter and some benefit through [ph] less physical disconnects in all digital markets.
And other expenses grew by 7.9% driven by higher corporate administrative labor costs, including advertising sales costs, enterprise sales and higher year-over-year IT spend at legacy TWC. Expense was partly offset by overhead reductions.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash share-based compensation, grew by 14.5%, and excluding transition costs, adjusted EBITDA grew by 15.1%. That growth includes continued growth in TWC [ph] Charter, excluding synergies at a level well above revenue growth. And absent transaction synergies and merger accounting effects and labor for all-digital strategy TWC [ph] in 2015, consolidated Charter adjusted EBITDA was probably growing just about -- just above the total revenue growth rate.
We've identified nearly $90 million of hard [ph] transaction synergies realized within the third quarter, which had a positive impact on the financial statements and was growing through the quarter. These various small projects have naturally come under review. There are additional benefits outside of the $90 million inside the quarter to the income statement, some of which could drive sustainably lower spend on discretionary initiatives, which will be harder to track definitively, and some of which may just be a temporary pause.[ph]
Going the opposite direction, some overhead groups continue to be double staffed [ph] as we prepare to transition systems and processes starting in Q4 and for many areas like going [ph] provisioning, IT and engineering, that will persist into 2017. So net-net, these puts and takes will continue for a while. But there are roughly $350 million of annualized hard [ph] transaction synergies already in the Q3 numbers, and we've completely identified $700 million in runway [ph] transaction synergies, which should be achieved at the first anniversary of the closing.
[indiscernible] qualities, these estimates continues to improve over time, and we continue to expect to significantly exceed the $800 million target after 3 years.
Legacy Charter, without any synergy benefit, continues to be a good proxy for how we expect subscribers and financials to develop once our Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed. Over the next few quarters, our operating results will reflect reversing certain product and packaging strategies, in particular, TWC, which, in our view, are not sustainable given high promotional roll-offs and the [ph] rate increases, high customer equipment fees, including modem [ph] fees, all coupled with complex and stacked [ph] offers. Our goal is to transition to the new pricing and packaging in a revenue-accretive manner, but the revenue growth rate [ph] will probably be lower in the sales [ph] Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed, relationship growth accelerates and the systematic approach to roll-offs and retention are in place.
In addition, we expect to spend more OpEx for service operations in [ph] capital for all-digital through 2018, similar to legacy Charter. But what will be different in the legacy Charter experience is that we will have transaction synergies in growth with legacy Charter operations for the financial [ph] incremental spending. And there's more for [indiscernible] at Bright House base that's already been digitized and we have lower unit cost on boxes.
Turning to net income on Slide 11. We generated $189 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus $2 million on a pro forma basis last year with the growth driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a gain on financial instruments from currency movements on our pound debt and related hedging. That's partially offset by transaction-related expense, including severance expense and higher depreciation and amortization driven by purchase price accounting stuff ups. 
Turning to Slide 12, capital expenditures totaled $1.75 billion including $109 million of transition spend. Excluding transition CapEx, our third quarter CapEx was down by $36 million year-over-year, about 2% driven by 1 all-digital spending at TWC, primarily on CPE which did not recur in the third quarter this year; two, part of your support capital spending at TWC, including real estate investments and network facilities, both of which were offset by investments in product development, which fall in the scalable infrastructure. 
Looking ahead, we expect our annual capital spending to rise once we restart all-digital in 2017. 
Slide 13 shows we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter versus $208 million of actual, not pro forma, free cash flow in the third quarter last year. That growth was largely driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and the close of our transactions. And although we don't provide pro forma free cash flow for the third quarter of 2015, on a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA less CapEx grew by 28% in the third quarter versus the prior year. 
We finished the third quarter with $60.2 billion in principal amount of debt. Run rate annualized cash interest expense was $3.3 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense would suggest a $2.9 billion annual run rate. The P&L difference, cash stems from the revaluation of required TWC debt on our GAAP balance sheet is part of purchase accounting. 
As of the end of the third quarter, total net debt to the last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x. Our long-term target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5x, and we continue to target the lower end of that range. We're deleveraging rapidly, and we continue -- and we can use that excess capacity in a number of ways. The priorities remain investment in the business, accretive M&A when available, returning capital to shareholders in the form share repurchases. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million in Charter shares for $281 million at an average price of about $267 per share. Share repurchase activity will continue to depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital, and we'll be opportunistic, similar to what we did in 2011, where we provided liquidity in size and fair priced institutional sellers. Our goal is to retain full strategic flexibility and not become trapped by formulary capital allocation guidance on buybacks. 
Finally, turning to our capital structure on Slide 15. We estimate that the total value of those assets is an excess of $6 billion and is comprised of our excess basis, marginal wells and a valuable tax-sharing agreement with Advance/Newhouse. We don't currently expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019, and even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income, excluding the impact of higher G&A from purchase accounting, should be below statutory rates for 7 years thereafter.

This quarter, we are confirming that it's $700 million at the end of year 1 run rate, and that we're going to significantly exceed the $800 million original target for the run rate at the end of 3 year. So that's what really matters, and that's what different from Charter is going to help us fund a lot of the investments that we're doing and despite different net growth curve financially for the new company.

Previously, Charter was less of a percentage of the DMA in most markets that we operated in. And as a result of that, we have marketing and efficiencies. We couldn't use mass media in a lot of cases. And the same effect actually impedes enterprise growth, because of the regional nature of a lot of enterprises and the multi-site  facilities that larger enterprises have and the inability to serve those consistently when you have a spindly footprint. And so the improvement in the footprint actually improves the opportunity that the enterprise market presents to us as well as the fact that -- I mean, the big news is, we have great technologies, we have the ability to put those technologies everywhere we operate, and we're really underpenetrated.

So that focus to the marketplace and even then, it's only half of the acquired footprint that we've taken through Spectrum pricing and packaging, so I think we'll be getting ahead of ourselves. I think it's fair to start looking at business and taking product conservatively once Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed across all the markets, and that's the right time to start thinking through. Already, we've been special pricing manufacturing, we are seeing uplift in sales that's material and what we would expect what we saw at Charter. As it relates to these different initiatives I described on the OpEx side, the curve can look a lot like Charter, offsetting that is going to be the fact that we have transaction synergies here, which we did not have in any previous experience, which will buffer that. And in addition to that, you have legacy Charter, which is still large portion of the footprint that's growing at a very fast pace, not just from customer relationships and -- but because of service transactions are coming down or EBITDA growth last time that we can really look at it on a completely standalone basis far outstrip the revenue growth. I mentioned that was without taking so I'm going to say it again and everybody's focused on how much ARPU can you get, but this isn't an ARPU-driven strategy.

But pricing and packaging will be fully rolled out by [indiscernible] and the question then is how fast does that flow through the business in a corrective way.

With regard to how that it's integrated, no, I think 5G type technologies are millimeterwave technologies or small cell high-frequency, high-capacity, low latency wireless networks are products that we will develop. They may or may not be connected to an MVNO relationship or mobility relationship. I think that there are opportunities to create wireless drops in certain cases. So direct wireless connections that require -- that mimic a physical connection to connect malls and other things through the enterprise base and buildings that are not contiguous or a big parking lots, or in some cases, low-density areas that might make some sense. And so the technology platform of these small high-capacity cells can work in a myriad of ways, both as a line extension devices as well as in-home devices that don't necessarily require mobility off property, in office devices that don't require mobility off property, so they don't have to be necessarily developed as a mobile service.

Interestingly, the rate of customers that take full packages from us is increasing. So we're growing our video business and the ratio, the mix of full-service product, the people would think of as a fat package, I guess, is actually increasing. So when we look at our opportunity, if we think there's a niche of market that could work with the products that are available and they're not all -- they all have limitations in terms of being targetable to the non-subscribing marketplace, which generally is lower income and out of the full package market because of their income. And so we have the ability, I think to continue to compete in that space if a product becomes available to us that actually satisfies a segment of the marketplace that's currently unserved. So far, we haven't found that magic mixture. We sowed packages ourselves. We continue to sell them, but the mix is actually going heavier.

19609,402615571,1072366,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefan.Since the closing of our transaction in May, we've been focused on quickly integrating our new assets. Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrate. In l",895,"Thank you, Stefan.
Since the closing of our transaction in May, we've been focused on quickly integrating our new assets. Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrate. In late September, we began deploying our marketing strategy in the Time Warner Cable footprint, including Texas and California. That process includes launching new service -- new pricing and packaging and the rebranding of our services as Spectrum. As a result, we're already seeing better sales in those markets.
As expected, these launches in September had little effect on Q3 results. However, later this month, we will roll out Spectrum in our New York City and Florida markets. By year end, we will have branded over 50% of our service area as Spectrum. We expect to be through all Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets by the spring of next year with customers and financial growth benefits following over time like they have at pre-deal Charter.
On the small and medium business sides, we will launch full Spectrum SMB product and pricing and packaging in Time Warner Cable and Bright House passings in mid-2017. Similar to residential, we will offer SMB products that are better than what the telcos offer at lower prices, driving customer growth in the same way we have at pre-deal Charter since launching SMB pricing and packaging in the early 2015. We're just beginning to modify business practices, policies and processes, which take time, and our goal is to avoid service disruptions.
Insourcing 20,000 employees will require upfront investments to train, house and equip our own personnel. There'll be a period of time when the productivity of those workers will be relatively low, preventing us from immediately reducing our outsourced workforce. Over time, however, the productivity of our insource employee base will grow and transactions will decline, allowing us to change our insource service mix faster. So we will invest more in each customer transaction, driving higher-quality work. That higher-quality work drives transactions out of the business, lowering transaction cost per dollar of revenue and per customer relationship. The operating and financial results of our strategy have been demonstrated at pre-deal Charter, and we expect the same type of results for the new company. We'll also complete the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House over the next 2 years.
Separate from the integration, we remain focused on product and network development. Over the next 5 years or so, with relatively small infrastructure investments, our network will be able to deliver symmetrical multi-gigabit speeds with high-compute and low-latency capabilities to all 50 million homes and businesses in our footprint.
In addition to residential and SMB offerings, we will serve the enterprise marketplace with increasingly sophisticated and advanced products. The opportunity is meaningful, and our addressable footprint is approximately $20 billion of annual enterprise spend, and today, we're capturing less than 10% of that spend.
There's also a large opportunity for us in the advanced advertising space. Our 2-way interactive plant allows for highly efficient household addressability, and we're testing new platforms, which will allow advertisers to better target, measure and reach consumers at the household level.
Finally, mobility remains an area of significant opportunity for Charter and the cable industry more broadly. We are already a significant wireless provider through our in- and out-of-home WiFi footprint, and we intend to activate our MVNO agreement with Verizon. In the near term, our goals with mobility are to drive more customer growth and extend customer life by offering an attractively priced product bundle.
Over the long term, our goals will broaden. We believe there will be opportunities for us to develop new services as higher frequency Spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, becomes available. Ultimately, our goals are consistent for any new businesses that we develop: to grow our overall business more quickly and to drag more shareholder value.
Before I turn the call over to Chris Winfrey who will cover the quarter in more detail, I wanted to highlight that we had a very strong quarter of financial results. We grew revenue by over 7% year-over-year and EBIT growth of over 14%, in part driven by transaction synergies, which are quickly benefiting our P&L, but also driven by the continued strength of our core operations at legacy Charter.
Third quarter customer results were more inconsistent with good performance at legacy Charter and Bright House with higher churn and downgrades from the Time Warner Cable markets, as we expected, given the way Time Warner Cable had marketed promotional pricing. Until our Spectrum pricing and packaging is launched across the newly acquired service areas, we continue to expect higher levels of churn and downgrades where Time Warner Cable is the operator.
Pre-deal Charter results continue to reflect the multiyear effect of our operating plans, including 6.2% residential and SMB customer growth over the last 12 months, with 9.7% Internet customer growth, 70,000 video net additions and 7.2% revenue growth without relying on rate increases. At the same time, service transactions and churn in those areas continue to come down.
So our growth plan is working, and our integration remains on or ahead of schedule. Nothing we have seen internally or externally has changed our optimism regarding our long-term business opportunities and growth prospects.
Chris, I'll turn the call to you."
19609,402615571,1072366,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

So I won't go through all that again, but last quarter's presentation and transcript r",1853,"Thanks, Tom. On our last quarter's call, I spent a lot of time discussing the effect of purchase accounting on the financials and the presentation of pro forma results. So I won't go through all that again, but last quarter's presentation and transcript regarding accounting items remain helpful to the investors.
As Stefan mentioned, note that I'll refer to the third quarter 2016 actual results versus prior year pro forma results as comparisons to the third quarter 2015 actuals aren't so helpful.
The customer and passings data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on legacy company definitions. And in a full -- few quarters' time, we'll recast customer data and the trending schedules using the same common definitions. Until then, certain data like penetration and ARPU
remain relevant for legacy entity trends, but they're less helpful in comparing one entity to another.
Turning to customers and PSUs during the third quarter. Total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, including 4.5% at legacy TWC, 6.2% at legacy Charter and 5.9% at legacy Bright House.
As Slide 8 shows, we grew residential PSUs by 336,000 versus 605,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was primarily driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, partly due to a low-price voice offer in TWC markets in prior year quarters, which is now resulting in higher voice downgrades and relationship churn.
Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by about 0.5%. Pre-deal Charter grew its residential video customer base by 1.2%, and Bright House lost about 2.6% of its residential video customers. Quarterly video customer performance improved year-over-year at pre-deal Charter and at Bright House, while TWC video net loss was 54,000 worse than last year, primarily driven by an increase in video downgrade activity, given legacy pricing and packaging issues.
So in total, we lost 47,000 residential video customers in the quarter, primarily driven by the losses at TWC.
In residential Internet, we added a total of 350,000 customers versus 369,000 last year. Our total residential Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.2% over the past year.
In voice, we grew customers by 33,000 versus 256,000 last year, largely driven by higher churn at TWC for the reasons I already mentioned.
Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million or by 4.8%. And over the same period, residential revenue per customer was up by about 1.8%, nearly all of which was driven by TWC rate increases early in the year and step-ups, which impacted unit growth.
Slide 9 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 6.7%.
Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 12.1%, a bit slower than last quarter, driven by lower cell tower growth and one-time benefit at NaviSite last year.
Finally, advertising was up 12.1%, and absent political, advertising revenue grew roughly 2%.
In total, third quarter pro forma revenue for the company was up 7.4% year-over-year.
Looking at total revenue growth by each of our legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 7.7%, with nearly half of residential growth still coming from rate; pre-deal Charter grew by 7.2% driven predominantly by continued customer growth; and Bright House revenue grew by 6.6% with their Florida markets continuing to do well.
Within operating expense in both current and historical periods, we've reclassified a number of operating expense items between lines. And as I mentioned last quarter, we do expect some ongoing remapping of our expenses as we move expense categories to the correct business unit in our operating structure. Total operating expenses grew by $234 million or 3.8% year-over-year, with the transition expense accounting for $32 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Programming increased 8.2% year-over-year driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by transaction synergies. I expect our programming line and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by Q4 or at least by Q1.
Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were down about 3% year-over-year, in part due to the purchase accounting adjustment made to the Dodgers contract that I discussed last quarter. The Dodgers' right costs are only expensed during the regular MLB season, both in the past and today.
Costs to service to customers declined by about 2% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which reflects lower service transactions at legacy Charter, the lack of all-digital activity at TWC this quarter versus last year's third quarter and some benefit through less physical disconnects in all-digital markets.
And other expenses grew by 7.9% driven by higher corporate administrative labor costs, including advertising sales costs, enterprise sales and higher year-over-year IT spend at legacy TWC. Expense was partly offset by overhead reductions.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash share-based compensation, grew by 14.5%, and excluding transition costs, adjusted EBITDA grew by 15.1%. That growth includes continued growth in legacy Charter, excluding synergies at a level well above revenue growth. And absent transaction synergies and merger accounting effects and labor for all-digital sent [ph] at TWC in 2015, consolidated Charter adjusted EBITDA was probably growing just about -- just above the total revenue growth rate.
We've identified nearly $90 million of hard transaction synergies realized within the third quarter, which have a positive impact on the financial statements and was growing through the quarter. These various small projects have naturally come under review. There are additional benefits outside of the $90 million inside the quarter to the income statement, some of which could drive sustainably lower spend on discretionary initiatives, which will be harder to track definitively, and some of which may just be a temporary pause.
Going the opposite direction, some overhead groups continue to be double staffed as we prepare to transition systems and processes starting in Q4 and for many areas like billing, provisioning, IT and engineering, that will persist into 2017. So net-net, those puts and takes will continue for a while. But there were roughly $350 million of annualized hard transaction synergies already in the Q3 numbers, and we've concretely identified $700 million in run rate transaction synergies, which should be achieved at the first anniversary of the closing.
The amount and quality of these estimates continues to improve over time, and we continue to expect to significantly exceed the $800 million target after 3 years.
Legacy Charter, without any synergy benefit, continues to be a good proxy for how we expect subscribers and financials to develop once our Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed. Over the next few quarters, our operating results will reflect reversing certain product and packaging strategies, in particular, TWC, which, in our view, are not sustainable given high promotional roll-offs and annual rate increases, high customer equipment fees, including modem fees, all coupled with complex and stacked offers. Our goal is to transition to the new pricing and packaging in a revenue-accretive manner, but the revenue growth rate at TWC will probably be lower until Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed, relationship growth accelerates and the systematic approach to roll-offs and retention are in place.
In addition, we expect to spend more OpEx for service operations and capital for all-digital through 2018, similar to legacy Charter. But what will be different in the legacy Charter experience is that we will have transaction synergies and growth from legacy Charter operations to finance much of that incremental spending. And there's more of the TWC and Bright House base that's already been digitized, and we have lower unit cost on boxes.
Turning the to net income on Slide 11. We generated $189 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus $2 million on a pro forma basis last year, with the growth driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a gain on financial instruments from currency movements on our British pound debt and related hedging. That was partially offset by transaction-related expense, including severance expense and higher depreciation and amortization driven by purchase price accounting step-ups.
Turning to Slide 12, capital expenditures totaled $1.75 billion, including $109 million of transition spend. Excluding transition CapEx, our third quarter CapEx was down by $36 million year-over-year or about 2% driven by, one, all-digital spending at TWC, primarily on CPE, which did not recur in the third quarter of this year; two, prior year support capital spending at TWC, including real estate investments and network facilities, both of which were offset by investments in product development, which fall in the scalable infrastructure.
Looking ahead, we expect our annual capital spending to rise once we restart all-digital in 2017.
As Slide 13 shows, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter versus $208 million of actual, not pro forma, free cash flow in the third quarter last year. That growth was largely driven by higher adjusted EBITDA given the close of our transactions. And although we don't provide pro forma free cash flow for the third quarter of 2015, on a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA less CapEx grew by 28% in the third quarter versus the prior year.
We finished the third quarter with $60.2 billion in principal amount of debt. Our run rate annualized cash interest expense was $3.3 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense would suggest a $2.9 billion annual run rate. The P&L difference, cash, stems from the revaluation of acquired TWC debt on our GAAP balance sheet as part of purchase accounting.
As of the end of the third quarter, total net debt for the last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x. Our long-term target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5x, and we continue to target the lower end of that range. We're deleveraging rapidly, and we continue -- and we can use that excess capacity in a number of ways. The priorities remain investment in the business, accretive M&A when available and returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million in Charter shares for $281 million at an average price of about $267 per share. Share repurchase activity will continue to depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital, and we'll be opportunistic, similar to what we did in 2011, where we provided liquidity in size and a fair price to institutional sellers. Our goal is to retain full strategic flexibility and not become trapped by formulated capital allocation guidance on buybacks.
Finally, turning to our tax assets on Slide 15. We estimate that the total value of those assets is in excess of $6 billion and is comprised of our excess basis, large NOLs and a valuable tax-sharing agreement with Advance/Newhouse. We don't currently expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019, and even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income, excluding the impact of higher G&A from purchase accounting, should be below statutory rates for 7 years thereafter.
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

So look, we're intentionally not getting into it line by line as it relates to the synergy targets or what's been realized because, frankly, from an investor perspective, I don't know that it matters that much. There's one thing to talk about, the one-time synergy; another thing is to talk about the growth curve and programming costs once you have that synergy over a multiyear period. Those are really distinct items. So for all the obvious reasons, we're not going to go line by line. I think the key thing for investors to understand is that we started off, I think, when we announced the transaction thinking it would be around $400 million in the first year -- at the end of the first year annualized. When we financed, it was at $500 million. Last quarter, it was at $600 million. This quarter, we're confirming that it's $700 million at the end of year 1 run rate, and that we're going to significantly exceed the $800 million original target for the run rate at the end of 3 years. So that's what really matters, and that's what different from Charter is going to help us fund a lot of the investments that we're doing and have a slightly different net growth curve financially for the new company. And from a programming expense line perspective, I guess the only thing I would tell you is, one, even though you step into a rate curve that has nothing to do -- that doesn't give you any indication of what slope was and the growth rate could have continued to be high on the rate card you stepped into. But we're not occurring against the contractual rate card, which we're doing. Beyond that, I'll just leave it at that. And for all the obvious reasons, we're not going to go much deeper into the topic."

But one of the advantages of the new company and the new footprint is the regionality that has been picked up in terms of our asset base. Previously, Charter was less of a percentage of DMA in most markets that we operated in. And as a result of that, we had marketing inefficiencies. We couldn't use mass media in a lot of places. And the same effect actually impedes enterprise growth because of the regional nature of a lot of enterprises and the multi-site facilities that larger enterprises have and the inability to serve those consistently when you have a spindly footprint. And so the improvement in the footprint actually improves the opportunity that the enterprise market presents to us as well as the fact that it's -- I mean, the big news is, we have great technologies. We have the ability to put those technologies everywhere we operate, and we're really underpenetrated. And to me, that's lots of upside."

So Vijay, you're going to have -- I'd love to lay out our own model for you here, but I can't. I think the -- what I would tell you is that the fourth quarter comment you made about volume significantly ramping already in the fourth quarter is I don't see that in the cards. Most of what we're doing, perspective pricing and packaging, isn't beginning until mid-November and then continue through December. So as that soaks through the marketplace, and even then, it's only half of the acquired footprint that would have been taken through Spectrum pricing and packaging, so I think we'd be getting ahead of ourselves. I think it's fair to start looking at the business and thinking about it conservatively once Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed across all the markets, and that's the right time to start thinking through. Already, where we've gone a Spectrum pricing and packaging, we are seeing uplift in sales, and it's material, and it's what we'd expect, and it's what we saw at Charter. As it relates to these different initiatives I described on the OpEx side, the curve can look a lot like charter. Offsetting that is going to be the fact that we have transaction synergies here, which we did not have in the previous Charter experience, which will buffer that. And in addition to that, you have legacy Charter, which is still a large portion of the footprint that's growing at a very fast pace, not just from customer relationships and -- but because our service transactions are coming down, our EBITDA growth, last time that we can really look at it on a completely stand-alone basis, far outstrip the revenue growth. As I've mentioned, that was without taking a bunch of rate, so I'm going to say it again. I know everybody is focused on how much ARPU can you get, but this isn't an ARPU-driven strategy. It's a customer growth-driven strategy, and it's one that's designed to take transactions out of the business. We did get some ARPU growth over time at legacy Charter. It -- that'll happen here, too. But that's not going to define our success one way or another."

So I would say that the number this quarter is a proxy for all future quarters until pricing and packaging is rolled out. But pricing and packaging will be fully rolled out by spring. And the question then is how fast does that flow through the business in a corrective way? But if you look at what we did at Charter, the substantial amount of the customer base turns over every year into new pricing and packaging through both churn activity and through operator activity. And so it's a difficult thing to model, but we're coming at it both ways, both from a premium value proposition and the pricing and packaging we have and doing those smart things that you can do with an existing customer base that's mispriced to move them in the right direction."

They may or may not be connected to an MVNO relationship or a mobility relationship. I think that there are opportunities to create wireless drops in certain cases. So direct wireless connections that require -- that mimic a physical connection to connect malls and other things in the enterprise phase and buildings that are not contiguous or big parking lots or in some cases, low-density areas that might make some sense. And so the technology platform of these small high-capacity cells can work in a myriad of ways, both as line extension devices as well as in-home devices that don't necessarily require mobility-off property, in-office devices that don't require mobility-off property, so they don't have to be necessarily developed as a mobile service.

So we're growing our video business and the ratio, the mix of full-service product, the people would think of it as a fat package, I guess, is actually increasing. So when we look at our opportunity, if we think there's a niche of market that could work with the products that are available, and they're not all -- they all have limitations in terms of being targetable to the nonsubscribing marketplace, which, generally, is lower income and out of the full package market because of their income. And so we have the ability, I think, to continue to compete in that space if a product becomes available to us that actually satisfies a segment of the marketplace that's currently unserved. So, so far, we haven't found that magic mixture. We sold some skinny packages ourselves. We have -- we continue to sell them, but the mix is actually going heavier.

19609,402615571,1072619,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefan.Since the closing of our transaction in May, we've been focused on quickly integrating our new assets. Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrate. In l",894,"Thank you, Stefan.
Since the closing of our transaction in May, we've been focused on quickly integrating our new assets. Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrate. In late September, we began deploying our marketing strategy in the Time Warner Cable footprint, including Texas and California. That process includes launching new service -- new pricing and packaging and the rebranding of our services as Spectrum. As a result, we're already seeing better sales in those markets.
As expected, these launches in September had little effect on Q3 results. However, later this month, we will roll out Spectrum in our New York City and Florida markets. By year-end, we will have branded over 50% of our service area as Spectrum. We expect to be through all Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets by the spring of next year with customers and financial growth benefits following over time like they have at pre-deal Charter.
On the small and medium business size, we will launch full Spectrum SMB product and pricing and packaging in Time Warner Cable and Bright House passings in mid-2017. Similar to residential, we will offer SMB products that are better than what the telcos offer at lower prices, driving customer growth in the same way we have at pre-deal Charter since launching SMB pricing and packaging in the early 2015. We're just beginning to modify business practices, policies and processes, which take time, and our goal is to avoid service disruptions.
Insourcing 20,000 employees will require upfront investments to train, house and equip our own personnel. There'll be a period of time when the productivity of those workers will be relatively low, preventing us from immediately reducing our outsourced workforce. Over time, however, the productivity of our insource employee base will grow and transactions will decline, allowing us to change our insource service mix faster. So we will invest more in each customer transaction, driving higher-quality work. That higher-quality work drives transactions out of the business, lowering transaction cost per dollar of revenue and per customer relationship. The operating and financial results of our strategy have been demonstrated at pre-deal Charter, and we expect the same type of results for the new company. We'll also complete the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House over the next 2 years.
Separate from the integration, we remain focused on product and network development. Over the next 5 years or so, with relatively small infrastructure investments, our network will be able to deliver symmetrical multi-gigabit speeds with high-compute and low-latency capabilities to all 50 million homes and businesses in our footprint.
In addition to residential and SMB offerings, we will serve the enterprise marketplace with increasingly sophisticated and advanced products. The opportunity is meaningful, and our addressable footprint is approximately $20 billion of annual enterprise spend, and today, we're capturing less than 10% of that spend.
There's also a large opportunity for us in the advanced advertising space. Our 2-way interactive plant allows for highly efficient household addressability, and we're testing new platforms, which will allow advertisers to better target, measure and reach consumers at the household level.
Finally, mobility remains an area of significant opportunity for Charter and the cable industry more broadly. We are already a significant wireless provider through our in- and out-of-home WiFi footprint, and we intend to activate our MVNO agreement with Verizon. In the near term, our goals with mobility are to drive more customer growth and extend customer life by offering an attractively priced product bundle.
Over the long term, our goals will broaden. We believe there will be opportunities for us to develop new services as higher frequency Spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, becomes available. Ultimately, our goals are consistent for any new businesses that we develop: to grow our overall business more quickly and to drag more shareholder value.
Before I turn the call over to Chris Winfrey who will cover the quarter in more detail, I wanted to highlight that we had a very strong quarter of financial results. We grew revenue by over 7% year-over-year and EBIT growth of over 14%, in part driven by transaction synergies, which are quickly benefiting our P&L, but also driven by the continued strength of our core operations at Legacy Charter.
Third quarter customer results were more inconsistent with good performance at Legacy Charter and Bright House with higher churn and downgrades in the Time Warner Cable markets, as we expected, given the way Time Warner Cable had marketed promotional pricing. Until our Spectrum pricing and packaging is launched across the newly acquired service areas, we continue to expect higher levels of churn and downgrades where Time Warner Cable is the operator.
Pre-deal Charter results continue to reflect the multiyear effect of our operating plans, including 6.2% residential and SMB customer growth over the last 12 months, with 9.7% Internet customer growth, 70,000 video net additions and 7.2% revenue growth without relying on rate increases. At the same time, service transactions and churn in those areas continue to come down.
So our growth plan is working, and our integration remains on or ahead of schedule. Nothing we have seen internally or externally has changed our optimism regarding our long-term business opportunities and growth prospects.
Chris, I'll turn the call to you."
19609,402615571,1072619,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. On our last quarter's call, I spent a lot of time discussing the effect of purchase accounting on the financials and the presentation of pro forma results.

On our last quarter's call, I spent a lot of time discussing the effect of purchase accounting on the financials and the presentation of pro forma results. So I won't go through all that again, but last quarter's presentation and transcript regarding accounting items remain helpful to investors.
As Stefan mentioned, note that I'll refer to the third quarter 2016 actual results versus prior year pro forma results as comparisons to the third quarter 2015 actuals aren't so helpful. 
The customer passings data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on legacy company definitions. And in a full -- few quarters' time, we'll recast customer data and the trending schedules using the same common definitions. Until then, certain data like penetration and ARPU remain relevant for legacy entity trends, but they're less helpful in comparing one entity to another.
Turning to customers and PSUs during the third quarter. Total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, including 4.5% at Legacy TWC, 6.2% at Legacy Charter and 5.9% at Legacy Bright House.
As Slide 8 shows, we grew residential PSUs by 336,000 versus 605,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was primarily driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, partly due to a low-price voice offer in TWC markets in prior year quarters, which is now resulting in higher voice downgrades and relationship churn.
Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by about 0.5%. Pre-deal Charter grew its residential video customer base by 1.2%, and Bright House lost about 2.6% of its residential video customers. Quarterly video customer performance improved year-over-year at pre-deal Charter and at Bright House, while TWC video net loss was 54,000 worse than last year, primarily driven by an increase in video downgrade activity, given legacy pricing and packaging issues.
So in total, we lost 47,000 residential video customers in the quarter, primarily driven by the losses at TWC.
In residential Internet, we added a total of 350,000 customers versus 369,000 last year. Our total residential Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.2% over the past year.
In voice, we grew customers by 33,000 versus 256,000 last year, largely driven by higher churn at TWC for the reasons I already mentioned.
Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million or by 4.8%. And over the same period, residential revenue per customer was up by about 1.8%, nearly all of which was driven by TWC rate increases early in the year and step-ups, which impacted unit growth.
Slide 9 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 6.7%.
Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 12.1%, a bit slower than last quarter, driven by lower cell tower growth and one-time benefit at NaviSite last year.
Finally, advertising was up 12.1%, and absent political, advertising revenue grew roughly 2%.
In total, third quarter pro forma revenue for the company was up 7.4% year-over-year.
Looking at total revenue growth by each of our legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 7.7%, with nearly half of residential growth still coming from rate; pre-deal Charter grew by 7.2% driven predominantly by continued customer growth; and Bright House revenue grew by 6.6% with the Florida markets continuing to do well.
Within operating expense in both current and historical periods, we've reclassified a number of operating expense items between lines. And as I mentioned last quarter, we do expect some ongoing remapping of our expenses as we move expense categories to the correct business unit in our operating structure. Total operating expenses grew by $234 million or 3.8% year-over-year, with the transition expense accounting for $32 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Programming increased 8.2% year-over-year driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by transaction synergies. I expect our programming line and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by Q4 or at least by Q1.
Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were down about 3% year-over-year, in part due to the purchase accounting adjustment made to the Dodgers contract that I discussed last quarter. The Dodgers' right costs are only expensed during the regular MLB season, both in the past and today.
Costs to service to customers declined by about 2% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which reflects lower service transactions at Legacy Charter, the lack of all-digital activity at TWC this quarter versus last year's third quarter and some benefit through less physical disconnects in all-digital markets.
And other expenses grew by 7.9% driven by higher corporate administrative labor costs, including advertising sales costs, enterprise sales and higher year-over-year IT spend at Legacy TWC. Expense was partly offset by overhead reductions.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash share-based compensation, grew by 14.5%, and excluding transition costs, adjusted EBITDA grew by 15.1%. That growth includes continued growth in Legacy Charter, excluding synergies at a level well above revenue growth. And absent transaction synergies and merger accounting effects and labor for all-digital activity at TWC in 2015, consolidated Charter adjusted EBITDA was probably growing just about -- just above the total revenue growth rate.
We've identified nearly $90 million of hard transaction synergies realized within the third quarter, which had a positive impact on the financial statements and was growing through the quarter. These various small projects have naturally come under review. There are additional benefits outside of the $90 million inside the quarter to the income statement, some of which could drive sustainably lower spend on discretionary initiatives, which will be harder to track definitively, and some of which may just be a temporary pause.
Going the opposite direction, some overhead groups continue to be double staffed as we prepare to transition systems and processes starting in Q4 and for many areas like billing, provisioning, IT and engineering, that will persist into 2017. So net-net, those puts and takes will continue for a while. But there were roughly $350 million of annualized hard transaction synergies already in the Q3 numbers, and we've concretely identified $700 million in run rate transaction synergies, which should be achieved at the first anniversary of the closing.
The amount and quality of these estimates continues to improve with time, and we continue to expect to significantly exceed the $800 million target after 3 years.
Legacy Charter, without any synergy benefit, continues to be a good proxy for how we expect subscribers and financials to develop once our Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed. Over the next few quarters, our operating results will reflect reversing certain product and packaging strategies, in particular, at TWC, which, in our view, are not sustainable given high promotional roll-offs and annual rate increases, high customer equipment fees, including modem fees, all coupled with complex and stacked offers. Our goal is to transition to the new pricing and packaging in a revenue-accretive manner, but the revenue growth rate at TWC will probably be lower until Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed, relationship growth accelerates and the systematic approach to roll-offs and retention are in place.
In addition, we expect to spend more OpEx for service operations and capital for all-digital through 2018, similar to Legacy Charter. But what will be different in the Legacy Charter experience is that we will have transaction synergies and growth from Legacy Charter operations to finance much of that incremental spending. And there's more of the TWC and Bright House base that's already been digitized, and we have lower unit cost on boxes.
Turning to net income on Slide 11. We generated $189 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus $2 million on a pro forma basis last year, with the growth driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a gain on financial instruments from currency movements on our British pound debt and related hedging. That was partly offset by transaction-related expense, including severance expense and higher depreciation and amortization driven by purchase price accounting step-ups.
Turning to Slide 12, capital expenditures totaled $1.75 billion, including $109 million of transition spend. Excluding transition CapEx, our third quarter CapEx was down by $36 million year-over-year or about 2% driven by, one, all-digital spending at TWC, primarily on CPE, which did not recur in the third quarter of this year; two, prior year support capital spending at TWC, including real estate investments and network facilities, both of which were offset by investments in product development, which fall in the scalable infrastructure.
Looking ahead, we expect our annual capital spending to rise once we restart all-digital in 2017.
As Slide 13 shows, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter versus $208 million of actual, not pro forma, free cash flow in the third quarter last year. That growth was largely driven by higher adjusted EBITDA given the close of our transactions. And although we don't provide pro forma free cash flow for the third quarter of 2015, on a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA less CapEx grew by 28% in the third quarter versus the prior year.
We finished the third quarter with $60.2 billion in principal amount of debt. Our run rate annualized cash interest expense was $3.3 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense would suggest a $2.9 billion annual run rate. The P&L difference to cash, stems from the revaluation of acquired TWC debt on our GAAP balance sheet as part of purchase accounting.
As of the end of the third quarter, total net debt for the last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x. Our long-term target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5x, and we continue to target the lower end of that range. We're deleveraging rapidly, and we continue -- and we can use that excess capacity in a number of ways. The priorities remain investment in the business, accretive M&A when available and returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million in Charter shares for $281 million at an average price of about $267 per share. Share repurchase activity will continue to depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital, and we'll be opportunistic, similar to what we did in 2011, where we provided liquidity in size and a fair price to institutional sellers. Our goal is to retain full strategic flexibility and not become trapped by formulated capital allocation guidance on buybacks.
Finally, turning to our tax assets on Slide 15. We estimate that the total value of those assets is in excess of $6 billion and is comprised of our excess basis, large NOLs and a valuable tax-sharing agreement with Advance/Newhouse. We don't currently expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019, and even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income, excluding the impact of higher G&A from purchase accounting, should be below statutory rates for 7 years thereafter.
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

So look, we're intentionally not getting into it line by line as it relates to the synergy targets or what's been realized because, frankly, from an investor perspective, I don't know that it matters that much. There's one thing to talk about, the one-time synergy; another thing is to talk about the growth curve and programming costs once you have that synergy over a multiyear period. And those are really distinct items. So for all the obvious reasons, we're not going to go line by line. I think the key thing for investors to understand is that we started off, I think, when we announced the transaction thinking it would be around $400 million in the first year -- at the end of the first year annualized. When we financed, it was at $500 million. Last quarter, it was at $600 million. This quarter, we're confirming that it's $700 million at the end of year 1 run rate, and that we're going to significantly exceed the $800 million original target for the run rate at the end of 3 years. So that's what really matters, and that's what, different from Charter, is going to help us fund a lot of the investments that we're doing and have a slightly different net growth curve financially for the new company. And from a programming expense line perspective, I guess the only thing I would tell you is, one, even though you step into a rate curve that has nothing to do -- that doesn't give you any indication of what slope was and the growth rate could have continued to be high on the rate card you stepped into. But we're not accruing against the contractual rate card, which we're billing. Beyond that, I'll just leave it at that.

But one of the advantages of the new company and the new footprint is the regionality that has been picked up in terms of our asset base. Previously, Charter was less of a percentage of DMA in most markets that we operated in. And as a result of that, we had marketing inefficiencies. We couldn't use mass media in a lot of places. And the same effect actually impedes enterprise growth because of the regional nature of a lot of enterprises and the multi-site facilities that larger enterprises have and the inability to serve those consistently when you have a spindly footprint. And so the improvement in the footprint actually improves the opportunity that the enterprise market presents to us as well as the fact that it's -- I mean, the big news is, we have great technologies. We have the ability to put those technologies everywhere we operate, and we're really underpenetrated. And to me, that's lots of upside."

So Vijay, you're going to have -- I'd love to lay out our own model for you here, but I can't. And I think the -- what I would tell you is that the fourth quarter comment you made about volume significantly ramping already in the fourth quarter is -- I don't see that in the cards. Most of what we're doing, prospective pricing and packaging, isn't beginning until mid-November and then continuing through December. So as that soaks through the marketplace, and even then, it's only half of the acquired footprint that would have been taken through Spectrum pricing and packaging, so I think we'd be getting ahead of ourselves. I think it's fair to start looking at the business and thinking about it conservatively once Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed across all the markets, and that's the right time to start thinking through. Already, where we've gone as Spectrum pricing and packaging, we are seeing uplift in sales, and it's material, and it's what we'd expect, and it's what we saw at Charter. As it relates to these different initiatives I described on the OpEx side, the curve can look a lot like Charter. Offsetting that is going to be the fact that we have transaction synergies here, which we did not have in the previous Charter experience, which will buffer that. And in addition to that, you have legacy Charter, which is still a large portion of the footprint that's growing at a very fast pace, not just from customer relationships and -- but because our service transactions are coming down, our EBITDA growth, last time that we can really look at it on a completely stand-alone basis, far outstrip the revenue growth. As I've mentioned, that was without taking a bunch of rate, so I'm going to say it again. I know everybody is focused on how much ARPU can you get, but this isn't an ARPU-driven strategy. It's a customer growth-driven strategy, and it's one that's designed to take transactions out of the business. We did get some ARPU growth over time at Legacy Charter. I think that'll happen here, too. But that's not going to define our success one way or another."

You guys did $280 million in the buyback versus $1 billion in cash flow. Should we think of the $750 million authorization as sort of a cap on your -- on repurchases between now and when you restart the all-digital? And maybe if you could talk, I know you don't want to get caught in a formulaic sort of equation here, but maybe the pacing on finishing that $750 million. And is that a math [ph] -- or does the board look at this sort of periodically? I'd imagine there's some people on the board that really like buybacks. And then secondly, on the sub losses, you said that you'd see the dislocation in Time Warner Cable through the repackaging and repricing. Do things get better or worse from here? Is there some comp that we get over? Or is this 60,000 number a good number going forward for that time being?"

So even if we weren't rolling out pricing and packaging, which has a positive benefit to churn, we've done other things in our whole relationship process, which is difficult to do during a transition process, but we're making changes where we can to the benefit of the consumer and trying to preserve the customer base while we roll out new pricing and packaging. So I wouldn't say that the number this quarter is a proxy for all future quarters until pricing and packaging is rolled out. But pricing and packaging will be fully rolled out by spring. And the question then is how fast does that flow through the business in a corrective way? But if you look at what we did at Charter, the substantial amount of the customer base turns over every year into new pricing and packaging through both churn activity and through operator activity. And so it's a difficult thing to model, but we're coming at it both ways, both from a creating a value proposition and the pricing and packaging we have and doing those smart things that you can do with an existing customer base that's mispriced to move them in the right direction."

With regard to how that it's integrated, no, I think 5G-type technologies or millimeter-wave technologies or small-cell, high-frequency, high-capacity, low-latency wireless networks are products that we will develop. They may or may not be connected to an MVNO relationship or a mobility relationship. I think that there are opportunities to create wireless drops in certain cases. So direct wireless connections that require -- that mimic a physical connection to connect malls and other things in the enterprise space and buildings that are not contiguous or have big parking lots or in some cases, low-density areas that might make some sense. And so the technology platform of these small high-capacity cells can work in a myriad of ways, both as line extension devices as well as in-home devices that don't necessarily require mobility off-property, in-office devices that don't require mobility off-property, so they don't have to be necessarily developed as a mobile service.

So when we look at our opportunity, if we think there's a niche of market that could work with the products that are available, and they're not all -- they all have limitations in terms of being targetable to the nonsubscribing marketplace, which, generally, has lower income and out of the full package market because of their income. And so we have the ability, I think, to continue to compete in that space if a product becomes available to us that actually satisfies a segment of the marketplace that's currently unserved. So, so far, we haven't found that magic mixture. We sold some skinny packages ourselves. We have -- we continue to sell them, but the mix is actually going heavier.

19609,402615571,1074314,"Charter Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Charter Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefan.Since the closing of our transaction in May, we've been focused on quickly integrating our new assets. Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrate. In l",894,"Thank you, Stefan.
Since the closing of our transaction in May, we've been focused on quickly integrating our new assets. Integration is going well, and we were able to continue to develop new services and capabilities at the same time we integrate. In late September, we began deploying our marketing strategy in the Time Warner Cable footprint, including Texas and California. That process includes launching new service -- new pricing and packaging and the rebranding of our services as Spectrum. As a result, we're already seeing better sales in those markets.
As expected, these launches in September had little effect on Q3 results. However, later this month, we will roll out Spectrum in our New York City and Florida markets. By year-end, we will have branded over 50% of our service area as Spectrum. We expect to be through all Time Warner Cable and Bright House markets by the spring of next year with customers and financial growth benefits following over time like they have at pre-deal Charter.
On the small and medium business size, we will launch full Spectrum SMB product and pricing and packaging in Time Warner Cable and Bright House passings in mid-2017. Similar to residential, we will offer SMB products that are better than what the telcos offer at lower prices, driving customer growth in the same way we have at pre-deal Charter since launching SMB pricing and packaging in the early 2015. We're just beginning to modify business practices, policies and processes, which take time, and our goal is to avoid service disruptions.
Insourcing 20,000 employees will require upfront investments to train, house and equip our own personnel. There'll be a period of time when the productivity of those workers will be relatively low, preventing us from immediately reducing our outsourced workforce. Over time, however, the productivity of our insource employee base will grow and transactions will decline, allowing us to change our insource service mix faster. So we will invest more in each customer transaction, driving higher-quality work. That higher-quality work drives transactions out of the business, lowering transaction cost per dollar of revenue and per customer relationship. The operating and financial results of our strategy have been demonstrated at pre-deal Charter, and we expect the same type of results for the new company. We'll also complete the all-digital transition at Time Warner Cable and Bright House over the next 2 years.
Separate from the integration, we remain focused on product and network development. Over the next 5 years or so, with relatively small infrastructure investments, our network will be able to deliver symmetrical multi-gigabit speeds with high-compute and low-latency capabilities to all 50 million homes and businesses in our footprint.
In addition to residential and SMB offerings, we will serve the enterprise marketplace with increasingly sophisticated and advanced products. The opportunity is meaningful, and our addressable footprint is approximately $20 billion of annual enterprise spend, and today, we're capturing less than 10% of that spend.
There's also a large opportunity for us in the advanced advertising space. Our 2-way interactive plant allows for highly efficient household addressability, and we're testing new platforms, which will allow advertisers to better target, measure and reach consumers at the household level.
Finally, mobility remains an area of significant opportunity for Charter and the cable industry more broadly. We are already a significant wireless provider through our in- and out-of-home WiFi footprint, and we intend to activate our MVNO agreement with Verizon. In the near term, our goals with mobility are to drive more customer growth and extend customer life by offering an attractively priced product bundle.
Over the long term, our goals will broaden. We believe there will be opportunities for us to develop new services as higher frequency Spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, becomes available. Ultimately, our goals are consistent for any new businesses that we develop: to grow our overall business more quickly and to drag more shareholder value.
Before I turn the call over to Chris Winfrey who will cover the quarter in more detail, I wanted to highlight that we had a very strong quarter of financial results. We grew revenue by over 7% year-over-year and EBIT growth of over 14%, in part driven by transaction synergies, which are quickly benefiting our P&L, but also driven by the continued strength of our core operations at Legacy Charter.
Third quarter customer results were more inconsistent with good performance at Legacy Charter and Bright House with higher churn and downgrades in the Time Warner Cable markets, as we expected, given the way Time Warner Cable had marketed promotional pricing. Until our Spectrum pricing and packaging is launched across the newly acquired service areas, we continue to expect higher levels of churn and downgrades where Time Warner Cable is the operator.
Pre-deal Charter results continue to reflect the multiyear effect of our operating plans, including 6.2% residential and SMB customer growth over the last 12 months, with 9.7% Internet customer growth, 70,000 video net additions and 7.2% revenue growth without relying on rate increases. At the same time, service transactions and churn in those areas continue to come down.
So our growth plan is working, and our integration remains on or ahead of schedule. Nothing we have seen internally or externally has changed our optimism regarding our long-term business opportunities and growth prospects.
Chris, I'll turn the call to you."

On our last quarter's call, I spent a lot of time discussing the effect of purchase accounting on the financials and the presentation of pro forma results. So I won't go through all that again, but last quarter's presentation and transcript regarding accounting items remain helpful to investors.
As Stefan mentioned, note that I'll refer to the third quarter 2016 actual results versus prior year pro forma results as comparisons to the third quarter 2015 actuals aren't so helpful. 
The customer passings data that you see in today's materials continue to be based on legacy company definitions. And in a full -- few quarters' time, we'll recast customer data and the trending schedules using the same common definitions. Until then, certain data like penetration and ARPU remain relevant for legacy entity trends, but they're less helpful in comparing one entity to another.
Turning to customers and PSUs during the third quarter. Total customer relationships grew year-over-year by 5.1%, including 4.5% at Legacy TWC, 6.2% at Legacy Charter and 5.9% at Legacy Bright House.
As Slide 8 shows, we grew residential PSUs by 336,000 versus 605,000 on a pro forma basis last year. The lower year-over-year PSU net adds was primarily driven by fewer voice net additions this quarter, partly due to a low-price voice offer in TWC markets in prior year quarters, which is now resulting in higher voice downgrades and relationship churn.
Over the last year, TWC residential video customers declined by about 0.5%. Pre-deal Charter grew its residential video customer base by 1.2%, and Bright House lost about 2.6% of its residential video customers. Quarterly video customer performance improved year-over-year at pre-deal Charter and at Bright House, while TWC video net loss was 54,000 worse than last year, primarily driven by an increase in video downgrade activity, given legacy pricing and packaging issues.
So in total, we lost 47,000 residential video customers in the quarter, primarily driven by the losses at TWC.
In residential Internet, we added a total of 350,000 customers versus 369,000 last year. Our total residential Internet customer base grew by 1.6 million customers or 8.2% over the past year.
In voice, we grew customers by 33,000 versus 256,000 last year, largely driven by higher churn at TWC for the reasons I already mentioned.
Over the last year, total pro forma residential customers grew by 1.1 million or by 4.8%. And over the same period, residential revenue per customer was up by about 1.8%, nearly all of which was driven by TWC rate increases early in the year and step-ups, which impacted unit growth.
Slide 9 shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year pro forma residential revenue growth of 6.7%.
Total commercial revenue, SMB and enterprise combined grew by 12.1%, a bit slower than last quarter, driven by lower cell tower growth and one-time benefit at NaviSite last year.
Finally, advertising was up 12.1%, and absent political, advertising revenue grew roughly 2%.
In total, third quarter pro forma revenue for the company was up 7.4% year-over-year.
Looking at total revenue growth by each of our legacy companies, TWC revenue grew by 7.7%, with nearly half of residential growth still coming from rate; pre-deal Charter grew by 7.2% driven predominantly by continued customer growth; and Bright House revenue grew by 6.6% with the Florida markets continuing to do well.
Within operating expense in both current and historical periods, we've reclassified a number of operating expense items between lines. And as I mentioned last quarter, we do expect some ongoing remapping of our expenses as we move expense categories to the correct business unit in our operating structure. Total operating expenses grew by $234 million or 3.8% year-over-year, with the transition expense accounting for $32 million of our total OpEx this quarter. Programming increased 8.2% year-over-year driven by contractual rate increases, partially offset by transaction synergies. I expect our programming line and year-over-year programming comparisons to be more representative on a pro forma basis by Q4 or at least by Q1.
Turning to regulatory, connectivity and produced content expense, these direct costs were down about 3% year-over-year, in part due to the purchase accounting adjustment made to the Dodgers contract that I discussed last quarter. The Dodgers' right costs are only expensed during the regular MLB season, both in the past and today.
Costs to service to customers declined by about 2% despite overall customer growth of 5.1%, which reflects lower service transactions at Legacy Charter, the lack of all-digital activity at TWC this quarter versus last year's third quarter and some benefit through less physical disconnects in all-digital markets.
And other expenses grew by 7.9% driven by higher corporate administrative labor costs, including advertising sales costs, enterprise sales and higher year-over-year IT spend at Legacy TWC. Expense was partly offset by overhead reductions.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash share-based compensation, grew by 14.5%, and excluding transition costs, adjusted EBITDA grew by 15.1%. That growth includes continued growth in Legacy Charter, excluding synergies at a level well above revenue growth. And absent transaction synergies and merger accounting effects and labor for all-digital activity at TWC in 2015, consolidated Charter adjusted EBITDA was probably growing just about -- just above the total revenue growth rate.
We've identified nearly $90 million of hard transaction synergies realized within the third quarter, which had a positive impact on the financial statements and was growing through the quarter. These various small projects have naturally come under review. There are additional benefits outside of the $90 million inside the quarter to the income statement, some of which could drive sustainably lower spend on discretionary initiatives, which will be harder to track definitively, and some of which may just be a temporary pause.
Going the opposite direction, some overhead groups continue to be double staffed as we prepare to transition systems and processes starting in Q4 and for many areas like billing, provisioning, IT and engineering, that will persist into 2017. So net-net, those puts and takes will continue for a while. But there were roughly $350 million of annualized hard transaction synergies already in the Q3 numbers, and we've concretely identified $700 million in run rate transaction synergies, which should be achieved at the first anniversary of the closing.
The amount and quality of these estimates continues to improve with time, and we continue to expect to significantly exceed the $800 million target after 3 years.
Legacy Charter, without any synergy benefit, continues to be a good proxy for how we expect subscribers and financials to develop once our Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed. Over the next few quarters, our operating results will reflect reversing certain product and packaging strategies, in particular, at TWC, which, in our view, are not sustainable given high promotional roll-offs and annual rate increases, high customer equipment fees, including modem fees, all coupled with complex and stacked offers. Our goal is to transition to the new pricing and packaging in a revenue-accretive manner, but the revenue growth rate at TWC will probably be lower until Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed, relationship growth accelerates and the systematic approach to roll-offs and retention are in place.
In addition, we expect to spend more OpEx for service operations and capital for all-digital through 2018, similar to Legacy Charter. But what will be different in the Legacy Charter experience is that we will have transaction synergies and growth from Legacy Charter operations to finance much of that incremental spending. And there's more of the TWC and Bright House base that's already been digitized, and we have lower unit cost on boxes.
Turning to net income on Slide 11. We generated $189 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus $2 million on a pro forma basis last year, with the growth driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a gain on financial instruments from currency movements on our British pound debt and related hedging. That was partly offset by transaction-related expense, including severance expense and higher depreciation and amortization driven by purchase price accounting step-ups.
Turning to Slide 12, capital expenditures totaled $1.75 billion, including $109 million of transition spend. Excluding transition CapEx, our third quarter CapEx was down by $36 million year-over-year or about 2% driven by, one, all-digital spending at TWC, primarily on CPE, which did not recur in the third quarter of this year; two, prior year support capital spending at TWC, including real estate investments and network facilities, both of which were offset by investments in product development, which fall in the scalable infrastructure.
Looking ahead, we expect our annual capital spending to rise once we restart all-digital in 2017.
As Slide 13 shows, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter versus $208 million of actual, not pro forma, free cash flow in the third quarter last year. That growth was largely driven by higher adjusted EBITDA given the close of our transactions. And although we don't provide pro forma free cash flow for the third quarter of 2015, on a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA less CapEx grew by 28% in the third quarter versus the prior year.
We finished the third quarter with $60.2 billion in principal amount of debt. Our run rate annualized cash interest expense was $3.3 billion, whereas our P&L interest expense would suggest a $2.9 billion annual run rate. The P&L difference to cash, stems from the revaluation of acquired TWC debt on our GAAP balance sheet as part of purchase accounting.
As of the end of the third quarter, total net debt for the last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x. Our long-term target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5x, and we continue to target the lower end of that range. We're deleveraging rapidly, and we continue -- and we can use that excess capacity in a number of ways. The priorities remain investment in the business, accretive M&A when available and returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million in Charter shares for $281 million at an average price of about $267 per share. Share repurchase activity will continue to depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital, and we'll be opportunistic, similar to what we did in 2011, where we provided liquidity in size and a fair price to institutional sellers. Our goal is to retain full strategic flexibility and not become trapped by formulated capital allocation guidance on buybacks.
Finally, turning to our tax assets on Slide 15. We estimate that the total value of those assets is in excess of $6 billion and is comprised of our excess basis, large NOLs and a valuable tax-sharing agreement with Advance/Newhouse. We don't currently expect to be a material cash income taxpayer until at least 2018, maybe not until 2019, and even then, our cash taxes as a percentage of GAAP pretax income, excluding the impact of higher G&A from purchase accounting, should be below statutory rates for 7 years thereafter.

I think the key thing for investors to understand is that we started off, I think, when we announced the transaction thinking it would be around $400 million in the first year -- at the end of the first year annualized. When we financed, it was at $500 million. Last quarter, it was at $600 million. This quarter, we're confirming that it's $700 million at the end of year 1 run rate, and that we're going to significantly exceed the $800 million original target for the run rate at the end of 3 years. So that's what really matters, and that's what, different from Charter, is going to help us fund a lot of the investments that we're doing and have a slightly different net growth curve financially for the new company. And from a programming expense line perspective, I guess the only thing I would tell you is, one, even though you step into a rate curve that has nothing to do -- that doesn't give you any indication of what slope was and the growth rate could have continued to be high on the rate card you stepped into. But we're not accruing against the contractual rate card, which we're billing. Beyond that, I'll just leave it at that. And for all the obvious reasons, we're not going to go much deeper into the topic."

But one of the advantages of the new company and the new footprint is the regionality that has been picked up in terms of our asset base. Previously, Charter was less of a percentage of DMA in most markets that we operated in. And as a result of that, we had marketing inefficiencies. We couldn't use mass media in a lot of places. And the same effect actually impedes enterprise growth because of the regional nature of a lot of enterprises and the multi-site facilities that larger enterprises have and the inability to serve those consistently when you have a spindly footprint. And so the improvement in the footprint actually improves the opportunity that the enterprise market presents to us as well as the fact that it's -- I mean, the big news is, we have great technologies. We have the ability to put those technologies everywhere we operate, and we're really underpenetrated. And to me, that's lots of upside."

So Vijay, you're going to have -- I'd love to lay out our own model for you here, but I can't. And I think the -- what I would tell you is that the fourth quarter comment you made about volume significantly ramping already in the fourth quarter is -- I don't see that in the cards. Most of what we're doing, prospective pricing and packaging, isn't beginning until mid-November and then continuing through December. So as that soaks through the marketplace, and even then, it's only half of the acquired footprint that would have been taken through Spectrum pricing and packaging, so I think we'd be getting ahead of ourselves. I think it's fair to start looking at the business and thinking about it conservatively once Spectrum pricing and packaging is fully deployed across all the markets, and that's the right time to start thinking through. Already, where we've gone as Spectrum pricing and packaging, we are seeing uplift in sales, and it's material, and it's what we'd expect, and it's what we saw at Charter. As it relates to these different initiatives I described on the OpEx side, the curve can look a lot like Charter. Offsetting that is going to be the fact that we have transaction synergies here, which we did not have in the previous Charter experience, which will buffer that. And in addition to that, you have legacy Charter, which is still a large portion of the footprint that's growing at a very fast pace, not just from customer relationships and -- but because our service transactions are coming down, our EBITDA growth, last time that we can really look at it on a completely stand-alone basis, far outstrip the revenue growth. As I've mentioned, that was without taking a bunch of rate, so I'm going to say it again. I know everybody is focused on how much ARPU can you get, but this isn't an ARPU-driven strategy. It's a customer growth-driven strategy, and it's one that's designed to take transactions out of the business. We did get some ARPU growth over time at Legacy Charter. I think that'll happen here, too. But that's not going to define our success one way or another."

So I wouldn't say that the number this quarter is a proxy for all future quarters until pricing and packaging is rolled out. But pricing and packaging will be fully rolled out by spring. And the question then is how fast does that flow through the business in a corrective way? But if you look at what we did at Charter, the substantial amount of the customer base turns over every year into new pricing and packaging through both churn activity and through operator activity. And so it's a difficult thing to model, but we're coming at it both ways, both from a creating a value proposition and the pricing and packaging we have and doing those smart things that you can do with an existing customer base that's mispriced to move them in the right direction."

They may or may not be connected to an MVNO relationship or a mobility relationship. I think that there are opportunities to create wireless drops in certain cases. So direct wireless connections that require -- that mimic a physical connection to connect malls and other things in the enterprise space and buildings that are not contiguous or have big parking lots or in some cases, low-density areas that might make some sense. And so the technology platform of these small high-capacity cells can work in a myriad of ways, both as line extension devices as well as in-home devices that don't necessarily require mobility off-property, in-office devices that don't require mobility off-property, so they don't have to be necessarily developed as a mobile service.

So we're growing our video business and the ratio, the mix of full-service product, the people would think of as a fat package, I guess, is actually increasing. So when we look at our opportunity, if we think there's a niche of market that could work with the products that are available, and they're not all -- they all have limitations in terms of being targetable to the nonsubscribing marketplace, which, generally, has lower income and out of the full package market because of their income. And so we have the ability, I think, to continue to compete in that space if a product becomes available to us that actually satisfies a segment of the marketplace that's currently unserved. So, so far, we haven't found that magic mixture. We sold some skinny packages ourselves. We have -- we continue to sell them, but the mix is actually going heavier. So I think about it as an evolving landscape. To the extent that content companies want to let us sell in smaller packages that have lower penetrations, we'd be glad to take advantage of that."
