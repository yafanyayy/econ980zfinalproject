Hasbro's record performance in 2015 reflected the strength of our global teams and the power of our brand blueprint. Through a focus on Franchise Brands and Partner Brands, consumer insight led innovation and compelling storytelling, we are connecting with consumers more deeply and across more demographics than ever before. 
It has taken us 10 years and significant investment to be in the position of successfully executing our strategy. Today, we are beginning to unlock the full economic value of our brands. 
The benefits of our strategy or not only delivering revenue gains,but are also driving higher levels of gross and operating margins, which we believe are sustainable for the long term. 
In recognition of the strength of the year and our positive outlook, our board recently voted to raise the quarterly dividend by 11%. This higher dividend reinforces our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. 
Demand for Hasbro initiatives were strong globally last year. Revenues increased 13% absent FX and reflected the strong demand we saw at the local level around the world. 
On a reported basis, revenues grew 4% despite a significant negative impact from foreign exchange translation. 
Point-of-sale was very strong, growing double digits in developed economies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Spain, Mexico and Australia as well as in many Emerging Markets where we've received retail data directly from our customers. 
We ended 2015 with retail inventories in very good shape, reflecting strong sell-through and high-quality merchandise on shelf. 
Our growth drove market share gains in the 11 major countries where we have data according to NPD. In Europe, we took over the #2 market share position. For the full year, Hasbro Franchise Brands revenue grew 7%, including the impact of currency translation, Franchise Brand revenues declined 2%. The 7% growth was led by increases in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY and MY LITTLE PONY. Our investments in innovation, storytelling and execution around the brand blueprint drove profitable revenue gains, while positioning us for future growth. 
NERF had a record year, increasing 13%, with new insight-driven innovations, including NERF Modulus and Rival and growth in Zombie Strike and N-Strike Elite, NERF was the largest brand across Hasbro last year. 
For the third year in a row, PLAY-DOH delivered record revenues, increasing 32%. We saw strong growth across all regions, including a 49% increase in Latin America. 
 
While DOHVINCI contributed to growth in its first full year, we also experienced double-digit growth in core PLAY-DOH compounds and play sets. 
Growth in MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING contributed to the 8% increase in the Games category absent FX. MAGIC had a very good fourth quarter with the release of Battle for Zendikar, which had the strongest start to a set in the brand's history. 
In addition to higher revenues in our Franchise Brands and several other Hasbro gaming brands, PIE FACE was a clear winner this holiday season and continues to be in high demand at retail. It was recently named, Toy of the Year, in the U.K. You'll learn more about the next innovation for PIE FACE later this week at Toy Fair. 
Expected TRANSFORMERS revenues declined given the difficult comparison with 2014 theatrical release. The decrease was at the low end of the traditional range following a movie and benefited from the success of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise television programming airing in markets around the world. 
In 2016, the second season of programming will begin airing, including on Cartoon Network segment. Outside the U.S., the markets are actively relaunching the brand, and we plan to extend the success we've seen in the U.S. globally. We believe that there is an opportunity to engage Girls around the more immersive franchise story, including a new approach to multiplatform entertainment, which we we'll be availing in the future. 
MY LITTLE PONY remains a vibrant and growing property. The core MY LITTLE PONY brand did extremely well 
[Audio Gap]
in EQUESTRIA GIRLS that offset much of the growth we saw in other areas of the brand. In January 2016, we launched a new mini doll EQUESTRIA GIRLS line, which is off to a very good start. 
Overall, MY LITTLE PONY brand engagement is very high across all lines of the business. To maintain this momentum, we are continuing to invest in multi-channel storytelling, while evolving our entertainment strategy to more effectively deliver content. 
The success of our Franchise Brands contributed to the 11% revenue growth in our Entertainment and Licensing segment. Despite a difficult comparison with 2014's TRANSFORMERS movie, consumer product licensing revenues increased. 
Over the past several years, we have built a world-class consumer products organization. We're driving momentum across several brands, including MY LITTLE PONY, TRANSFORMERS and MONOPOLY, delivering cross category statements at retail, while making inroads in Emerging Markets, including China and Thailand. 
The Entertainment and Licensing segment is benefiting from our ongoing investment in storytelling through episodic television programming, including a multi-year digital streaming deal. 
With the continued growth, the Entertainment and Licensing segment increased to 6% of total revenues and 11% of operating profit. At a 31% operating profit margin, our ongoing investments are positively contributing to the overall operating margin for Hasbro. 
Shifting to our Partner Brands. Several brands delivered strong growth last year. STAR WARS fans around the world have embraced the Force Awakens both in theater and in merchandise. Hasbro's 2015 STAR WARS revenue was on par with past movie years. Nearly half of this revenue was recorded in the fourth quarter given the December 18 movie release. The next wave of Hasbro STAR WARS product is on shelves today and new product will continue to be available in 2016, supporting both the spring home entertainment windows for the Force Awakens as well as the December 16 release of Rogue One. 
Given the level of entertainment and the strong global demand we are seeing, 2016 STAR WARS revenue could be on par with 2015. 
Earlier in 2015, JURASSIC WORLD and MARVEL'S The Avengers: Age of Ultron, both established themselves as top grossing films at the global box office. Each property made strong revenue contributions for Hasbro. 
In total, our Partner Brands revenues were slightly higher than our previous expectation and totaled 28% of revenues. Strong STAR WARS results in the fourth quarter were major contributor to the overall performance of these brands. We continue to expect Partner Brands revenues to be 20% to 25% of total Hasbro revenues.  In the near term, this number is expected to be at the higher end of this range. 
In 2016, Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY's FROZEN fashion dolls and small dolls became available. These products are already on shelves in the U.S. and rolling out internationally. We shipped a very small amount of product in the fourth quarter given the timing of retailer plants. Shipments are now ramping up and early consumer indications are positive. Great partnership with DISNEY and our global retailers is resulting in a smooth transition with product on shelves beginning in January. We are closely monitoring inventory at retail to ensure this continues in 2016 as revenues grow and we built greater efficiency and profitability into this new business. 
This growth in our Franchise and Partner Brands portfolio drove growth in every region on a constant dollar basis. The U.S. and Canada segment delivered double-digit revenue and operating profit growth. 
In 2012, we reorganized our U.S. teams and put in place a plan to drive both top and bottom line growth. 
Over the past several years, this has substantially improved profit leverage and segment operating profit margin. The team has done a tremendous job working with our retail partners to build a robust, growing and profitable business. 
The International segment revenues grew 16% absent FX and Emerging Markets increased 15%. We continue to expect modest double-digit growth in the Emerging Markets going forward. Our regional teams are navigating challenging economic environments, but are successfully driving our brands and positioning Hasbro for profitable growth over the long term. 
In closing, 2015 was a very good year for Hasbro. Positive momentum in Hasbro Franchise Brands and our Partner Brands positions us to capitalize on the innovation and entertainment our teams are delivering in 2016 and beyond. 
As Deb will discuss, Hasbro is in a very strong financial position. We continue to strategically invest in brands and initiatives where we see additional revenue and earnings potential, while returning excess cash to shareholders. 
This Friday, February 12, is our Annual Toy Fair investor event. We look forward to seeing you in New York and sharing with you our future brand and business initiatives. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Deb. Dabbed?"

We have tremendous momentum in our brands and we're driving profitable growth throughout our business. 
Our global team faced an extremely challenging currency environments and delivered successful programs to manage retail, consumer and business demands, while improving the profitability of Hasbro. 
In 2015, absent FX, we grew revenues across all operating segments and major geographic regions as well as in both franchise and Partner Brands. We delivered cost savings, while investing in the future growth of our business. 
Finally, we generated $552 million in operating cash flow, ending the year with close to $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. 
We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities and investing in our business, while returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. 
Today's announced 11% dividend increase, coupled with $479 million in available share repurchase authorizations enables us to continue on this path. 
Looking at our segments for the full year 2015. Revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 10%. Excluding a $14 million negative impact for foreign exchange, segment revenues increased 11%. 
Growth in the Boys, Games and Preschool categories more than offset the decline in the Girls category. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenue increased 1% behind growth in NERF, PLAY-DOH, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and LITTLEST PET SHOP, which offset the expected decline in TRANSFORMERS. 
Partner Brands STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD, MARVEL and DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS also contributed to the segment's growth.  FURBY revenues was down as expected. 
U.S. point-of-sale posted double-digit growth in all categories other than Girls, which declined 2%. Retail inventory was a very good quality at year-end. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 29% for the year, reflecting higher revenues, the impact of cost-saving activities and a favorable product mix. 
In the International segment, foreign exchange had a negative $379.4 million impact on revenues. Absent this impact, International segment revenues grew 16% and Emerging Markets increased approximately 15%. 
Including the impact of FX, revenues decreased 3% and Emerging Markets revenue decreased 9%. 
Internationally, as reported revenues in the Boys and Preschool categories increased but were more than offset by declines in the Games and Girls categories. 
Franchise Brand revenues declined 6% despite growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF and MONOPOLY. 
Additionally, STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD, MARVEL and DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS were positive contributors.  As expected, FURBY and TRANSFORMERS each had a significant revenue decline for the year. 
Absent FX, operating profit in the segment increased 12%. On a reported basis, operating profit declined 6%, reflecting the negative foreign exchange impact. 
Foreign exchange is anticipated to negatively impact 2016 as well. 
At our current expected 2016 rates, our 2015 revenues would have been approximately $100 million less than what we reported. 
We anticipate approximately 15% to 20% of this impact will fall to the 2016 operating profit line. 
The Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues grew 11%. The segment benefited from a multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios television programming signed during the first quarter of 2015. 
In addition, consumer product licensing revenues increased for the year, overcoming a difficult comparison with TRANSFORMERS movie-related merchandising revenues. 
Segment operating profit increased 27% and margin grew 31.4% [ph].
 We continue to make investments in our consumer products team, digital gaming and storytelling to drive future growth in these higher profit revenue sources. 
Turning to overall expenses for Hasbro. Growth in royalty-bearing entertainment partner revenues, and, to a lesser extent, the Entertainment and Licensing segment revenue combined to deliver a favorable product mix. This mix, in turn, drove lower cost of sales, which were 37.7% in 2015 versus 39.7% in 2014. 
In conjunction with the higher partner brand revenue mix, royalties increased to 8.5% of revenues. 
Combined, cost of sales and royalties decreased approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. 
As Brian mentioned, the execution of our strategy and our focus on improved efficiency is creating sustainably higher levels of gross margin for Hasbro. 
As we look to 2016, as a percent of revenues, we anticipate cost of sales of 38% and royalties lower at 8%. 
Operating profit dollars and margin grew year-over-year. Higher revenue and operating expense leverage more than offset investments we are making. 
As we continue to execute our brand blueprint, we are focusing on fewer brands, expanding our Licensing revenues and improving the efficiency of our operations. These changes in our business model are creating more innovative product and higher growth and operating profit margins in our business. To fully execute our strategy, investments and innovation are paramount to our long-term success. 
Product development totaled 5.5% of revenues. This includes the investment in our DISNEY PRINCESS  and FROZEN offerings for which revenues commenced in January in a more meaningful way. 
We'll also continue to invest in building awareness for our brands. In 2015, advertising declined to 9.2% of revenues. This decline is primarily due to the higher percent of entertainment-backed revenues, which traditionally carry less advertising spend. 
Intangible amortization declined for the year as some of our assets had been fully amortized. Program production cost amortization declined slightly to 1% of revenues. Storytelling is an important element of our brand building, and we will continue investing in content development for television, film and other mediums. 
SD&A increased 8% for the year. A number of factors contributed to the growth in expenses. As we outlined in previous calls and in our November Investor Day, we continue to make strategic investments in our business. This includes investing in the digital platform for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. This is a multi-year investment program, which we believe will expand the potential market for MAGIC over the long term. 
In addition, our IT expense and depreciation is higher, reflecting our increased investments in improving the efficiency of Hasbro going forward. 
As we outlined in November, these expenses increased in 2015 and will again increase in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, we anticipate they will begin to decline. 
Compensation expense was also higher, reflecting the strength of our results. We are able to expand operating profit, while making incremental investments given the ongoing focus of our teams on managing expenses and the inherent financial advantages of executing our brand blueprint strategy. 
Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. On an as adjusted basis, other income was $2.5 million compared to an expense of $8.5 million last year. The improvement resulted from increased profit associated with our 40% share of the operating income in the Discovery Family Channel as well as lower losses from foreign exchange transactions. 
The 2015 underlying tax rate was essentially flat with last year at 26.4% versus 26.5%. Our 2016 tax rate is anticipated to remain in the range of 26.5% to 27%. This will fluctuate to reflect the geographic mix of profit. 
On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.51 versus $3.15 in 2014. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Of our nearly $1 billion in cash at year-end, almost all of it is located outside the U.S. We returned $310.7 million to shareholders in 2015. $225.8 million in dividends and $84.9 million in share repurchase. 
We announced today that the board has approved an 11% or $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend. The new quarterly dividend rate of $0.51 per share will be payable May 16 to shareholders of record on May 2. We will continue to returning excess cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. 
Receivables at year-end were up 11% and DSOs declined 1 day to 75 days. 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 23%, equal to the fourth quarter revenue growth absent FX. 
Inventories increased 13% versus last year. Adjusting for negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 24%, in line with our growing business and entertainment schedules. 
Our inventory both at the retail and at Hasbro, is of high-quality, and we are well positioned to meet demand in 2016. 
In closing, 2015 was an extremely strong year for Hasbro. We continue to make important advances in the execution of our strategy, and we invested in strategic initiatives to drive long-term shareholder value creation. We have positive momentum in our business, and we are well-positioned for 2016 and beyond. We look forward to sharing more with you on Friday at Toy Fair. Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

We've talked about the points of leverage that we have in our business in order to expand them over time. Obviously, the growth of our Franchise Brands that enjoy a higher-than-average operating profit margin, the growth of our Entertainment and Licensing business, which as you saw has a very strong operating margin as well. And then, of course, as we continue to grow International markets, particularly in Emerging Markets, and we get great economy of scales, those begin to approach the company's average operating profit margin. So those 3 levers broadly will enable us overtime to continue to expand operating margin. But we do believe that our operating profit margins and gross margins are at a new place and can remain at this higher level beyond 2015."

However, if you look at the fourth quarter or more the movie-related revenues, the International segment revenues as a percent go to 54% and the U.S. is 46%.

And then, of course, our 3 x 3 quarter in scale action figure and then, of course, our Black Series. Those are some of our top sellers, and we're rolling out new products and already have for 2016.

In the first quarter, we'll work through the transition in PRINCESS, so we will be shipping PRINCESS products, and you're starting to see displace up and rolling the product out around the world, and we're very happy with the transition in working with DISNEY and our retailers, they've been incredibly supported and we're seeing some good early indications of how our product is selling, it's selling quite well. And then if we talk about NERF, the brand was up both in the quarter as well as full year double digits and the sell-through was very strong, and it's really around Modulus, around N-Strike and around Zombie Strike are kind of the top performance for the year and of course NERF REBELLE, which is launched in a couple of countries, and we'll roll that out in the few more as we move forward this is a little bit more of the paintball like play pattern that are rolling out in markets around the world. So again, the brand is our top brand at the company, and we just wanted to give that perspective because as we had created the franchise and strategy many years ago, we believe that those brands were capable of growing to first hundreds and millions of dollars and then over time, even larger and NERF and PLAY-DOH are great examples of brands that have grown significantly over the last few years and among the top brands of the company."

Hasbro's record performance in 2015 reflected the strength of our global teams and the power of our brand blueprint. Through a focus on Franchise Brands and Partner Brands, consumer insight led innovation and compelling storytelling, we are connecting with consumers more deeply and across more demographics than ever before. 
It has taken us 10 years in significant investment to be in the position of successfully executing our strategy. Today, we are beginning to unlock the full economic value of our brands. The benefits of our strategy or not only delivering revenue gains, but are also driving higher levels of gross and operating margins, which we believe are sustainable for the long term. 
In recognition of the strength of the year and our positive outlook, our board recently voted to raise the quarterly dividend by 11%. This higher dividend reinforces our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. 
Demand for Hasbro initiatives was strong globally last year. Revenues increased 13% absent FX and reflected the strong demand we saw at the local level around the world. On a reported basis, revenues grew 4% despite a significant negative impact from foreign exchange translation. 
Point-of-sale was very strong, growing double digits in developed economies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Spain, Mexico and Australia, as well as in many Emerging Markets where we've received retail data directly from our customers. We ended 2015 with retail inventories in very good shape, reflecting strong sell-through and high-quality merchandise on shelf. 
Our growth drove market share gains in the 11 major countries where we have data according to NPD. In Europe, we took over the #2 market share position. For the full year, Hasbro Franchise Brands revenue grew 7%. Including the impact of currency translation, Franchise Brand revenues declined 2%. The 7% growth was led by increases in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY and MY LITTLE PONY. Our investments in innovation, storytelling and execution around the brand blueprint drove profitable revenue gains, while positioning us for future growth. 
NERF had a record year, increasing 13%, with new insight-driven innovations, including Nerf Modulus and Rival and growth in Zombie Strike and N-Strike Elite. NERF was the largest brand across Hasbro last year. 
For the third year in a row, PLAY-DOH delivered record revenues, increasing 32%. We saw strong growth across all regions, including a 49% increase in Latin America. While DOHVINCI contributed to growth in its first full year, we also experienced double-digit gains in core PLAY-DOH compounds and play sets. 
Growth in MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING contributed to the 8% increase in the Games category absent FX. MAGIC had a very good fourth quarter with the release of Battle for Zendikar, which had the strongest start to a set in the brand's history. 
In addition to higher revenues in our Franchise Brands and several other Hasbro gaming brands, PIE FACE was a clear winner this holiday season and continues to be in high demand at retail. It was recently named, Toy of the Year, in the U.K. You'll learn more about the next innovation for PIE FACE later this week at Toy Fair. 
Expect that TRANSFORMERS revenues declined given the difficult comparison with the 2014 theatrical release. The decrease was at the low end of the traditional range following a movie and benefited from the success of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise television programming airing in markets around the world. 
In 2016, the second season of programming will begin airing, including on Cartoon Network in the U.S. segment. Outside the U.S., the markets are actively relaunching the brand, and we plan to extend the success we've seen in the U.S. globally. We believe that there is an opportunity to engage girls around a the more immersive franchise story, including anew approach to multi-platform entertainment, which we will be availing in the future. 
MY LITTLE PONY remains a vibrant and growing property. The core MY LITTLE PONY brand did extremely well in 2015 with positive revenue growth in several countries backed by strong point-of-sale and the launch of the new Friendship is Magic collectible segment. MY LITTLE PONY has established itself as a major lifestyle brand. And for 2015, it was our top licensed property. We experienced a slowdown in EQUESTRIA GIRLS that offset much of the growth we saw in other areas of the brand. In January 2016, we launched a new mini doll EQUESTRIA GIRLS line, which is off to a very good start.  Overall, MY LITTLE PONY brand engagement is very high across all lines of the business. To maintain this momentum, we are continuing to invest in multi-channel storytelling, while evolving our entertainment strategy to more effectively deliver content. 
The success of our Franchise Brands contributed to the 11% revenue growth in our Entertainment and Licensing segment. Despite a difficult comparison with 2014's TRANSFORMERS movie, consumer product licensing revenues increased. 
Over the past several years, we have built a world-class consumer products organization. We are driving momentum across several brands, including MY LITTLE PONY, TRANSFORMERS and MONOPOLY, delivering cross-category statements at retail, while making inroads in Emerging Markets, including China and Thailand. 
The Entertainment and Licensing segment is benefiting from our ongoing investment in storytelling through episodic television programming, including a multiyear digital streaming deal. 
With the continued growth, the Entertainment and Licensing segment increased to 6% of total revenues and 11% of operating profit. At a 31% operating profit margin, our ongoing investments are positively contributing to the overall operating margin for Hasbro. 
Shifting to our Partner Brands. Several brands delivered strong growth last year. STAR WARS fans around the world have embraced the Force Awakens both in theater and in merchandise. Hasbro's 2015 STAR WARS revenue was on par with past movie years. Nearly half of this revenue was recorded in the fourth quarter given the December 18 movie release. The next wave of Hasbro STAR WARS product is on shelves today and new product will continue to be available in 2016, supporting both the spring home entertainment window for the Force Awakens as well as the December '16 release of Rogue One. Given the level of entertainment and the strong global demand we are seeing, 2016 STAR WARS revenue could be on par with 2015. 
Earlier in 2015, JURASSIC WORLD and MARVEL'S The Avengers: Age of Ultron, both established themselves as top grossing films at the global box office. Each property made strong revenue contributions for Hasbro. 
In total, our Partner Brand revenues were slightly higher than our previous expectation and totaled 28% of revenues. Strong STAR WARS results in the fourth quarter were a major contributor to the over-performance of these brands. We continue to expect Partner Brand revenues to be 20% to 25% of total Hasbro revenues. In the near term, this number is expected to be at the higher end of this range. 
In 2016, Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY's FROZEN fashion dolls and small dolls became available. These products are already on shelves in the U.S. and rolling out internationally. We shipped a very small amount of product in the fourth quarter given the timing of retailer plans. Shipments are now ramping up, and early consumer indications are positive. Great partnership with DISNEY and our global retailers is resulting in a smooth transition with product on shelf beginning in January. We are closely monitoring inventory at retail to ensure this continues in 2016 as revenues grow. And we build greater efficiency and profitability into this new business. 
This growth in our Franchise and Partner Brands portfolio drove growth in every region on a constant dollar basis. The U.S. and Canada segment delivered double-digit revenue and operating profit growth.  In 2012, we reorganized our U.S. teams and put in place a plan to drive both top and bottom line growth. 
Over the past several years, this has substantially improved profit leverage and segment operating profit margin. The team has done a tremendous job working with our retail partners to build a robust, growing and profitable business. 
The International segment revenues grew 16%, absent FX, and Emerging Markets increased 15%. We continue to expect modest double-digit growth in the Emerging Markets going forward. Our regional teams are navigating challenging economic environments, but are successfully driving our brands and positioning Hasbro for profitable growth over the long term. 
In closing, 2015 was a very good year for Hasbro. Positive momentum in Hasbro Franchise Brands and our Partner Brands positions us to capitalize on the innovation and entertainment our teams are delivering in 2016 and beyond. 
As Deb will discuss, Hasbro is in a very strong financial position. We continue to strategically invest in brands and initiatives where we see additional revenue and earnings potential, while returning excess cash to shareholders. 
This Friday, February 12, is our Annual Toy Fair Investor Event. We look forward to seeing you in New York and sharing with you our future brand and business initiatives. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"

We have tremendous momentum in our brands, and we're driving profitable growth throughout our business. 
Our global teams faced an extremely challenging currency environments and delivered successful programs to manage retail, consumer and business demands, while improving the profitability of Hasbro. 
In 2015, absent FX, we grew revenues across all operating segments and major geographic regions as well as in both Franchise and Partner Brands. We delivered cost savings, while investing in the future growth of our business. 
Finally, we generated $552 million in operating cash flow, ending the year with close to $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. 
We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities and investing in our business, while returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Today's announced 11% dividend increase, coupled with $479 million in available share repurchase authorizations, enables us to continue on this path. 
Looking at our segments for the full year 2015, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 10%. Excluding a $14 million negative impact from foreign exchange, segment revenues increased 11%.  Growth in the Boys, Games and Preschool categories more than offset a decline in the Girls category. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenue increased 1% behind growth in NERF, PLAY-DOH, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and LITTLEST PET SHOP, which offset the expected decline in TRANSFORMERS. 
Partner Brands: STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD, MARVEL and DISNEY's DESCENDANTS also contributed to the segment's growth. FURBY revenue was down as expected. 
U.S. point-of-sale posted double-digit growth in all categories other than Girls, which declined 2%. Retail inventory was a very good quality at year end. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 29% for the year, reflecting higher revenues, the impact of cost-saving activities and a favorable product mix. 
In the International segment, foreign exchange had a negative $379.4 million impact on revenues. Absent this impact, International segment revenues grew 16%, and Emerging Markets increased approximately 15%. Including the impact of FX, revenues decreased 3%; and Emerging Markets revenue decreased 9%. 
Internationally, as reported revenues in the Boys and Preschool categories increased but were more than offset by declines in the Games and Girls categories. Franchise Brand revenues declined 6% despite growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF and MONOPOLY. 
Additionally, STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD, MARVEL and DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS were positive contributors. As expected, FURBY and TRANSFORMERS each had a significant revenue decline for the year. Absent FX, operating profit in the segment increased 12%. On a reported basis, operating profit declined 6%, reflecting the negative foreign exchange impact. 
Foreign exchange is anticipated to negatively impact 2016 as well. At our current expected 2016 rates, our 2015 revenues would have been approximately $100 million less than what we reported. We anticipate approximately 15% to 20% of this impact will fall to the 2016 operating profit line. 
The Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues grew 11%. The segment benefited from a multiyear digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios television programming signed during the first quarter of 2015.  In addition, consumer product licensing revenues increased for the year, overcoming a difficult comparison with TRANSFORMERS movie-related merchandise and revenues. 
Segment operating profit increased 27%, and margin grew 31.4%. We continue to make investments in our consumer products team, digital gaming and storytelling to drive future growth in these higher-profit revenue sources. 
Turning to overall expenses for Hasbro. Growth in royalty-bearing entertainment partner revenues, and, to a lesser extent, the Entertainment and Licensing segment revenue combined to deliver a favorable product mix. This mix, in turn, drove lower cost of sales, which were 37.7% in 2015 versus 39.7% in 2014. In conjunction with the higher Partner Brand revenue mix, royalties increased to 8.5% of revenues. Combined, cost of sales and royalties decreased approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. 
As Brian mentioned, the execution of our strategy and our focus on improved efficiency is creating sustainably higher levels of gross margin for Hasbro. As we look to 2016, as a percent of revenues, we anticipate cost of sales of 38%, and royalties lower at 8%. Operating profit dollars and margin grew year-over-year. Higher revenue and operating expense leverage more than offset investments we are making. 
As we continue to execute our brand blueprint, we are focusing on fewer brands, expanding our Licensing revenues and improving the efficiency of our operations. These changes in our business model are creating more innovative product and higher growth and operating profit margins in our business. To fully execute our strategy, investments and innovation are paramount to our long-term success. 
Product development totaled 5.5% of revenues. This includes the investment in our DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN offerings for which revenues commenced in January in a more meaningful way. We'll also continue to invest in building awareness for our brands. In 2015, advertising declined to 9.2% of revenues. This decline is primarily due to the higher percent of entertainment-backed revenues, which traditionally carry less advertising spend. 
Intangible amortization declined for the year as some of our assets had been fully amortized. Program production cost amortization declined slightly to 1% of revenues. Storytelling is an important element of our brand building. And we will continue investing in content development for television, film and other mediums. 
SD&A increased 8% for the year. A number of factors contributed to the growth in expenses. As we outlined in previous calls and in our November Investor Day, we continue to make strategic investments in our business. This includes investing in the digital platform for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. This is a multiyear investment program, which we believe will expand the potential market for MAGIC over the long term. In addition, our IT expense and depreciation is higher, reflecting our increased investments in improving the efficiency of Hasbro going forward. 
As we outlined in November, these expenses increased in 2015 and will again increase in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, we anticipate they will begin to decline. Compensation expense was also higher, reflecting the strength of our results. We are able to expand operating profit, while making incremental investments given the ongoing focus of our teams on managing expenses and the inherent financial advantages of executing our brand blueprint strategy. 
Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. On an as adjusted basis, other income was $2.5 million compared to an expense of $8.5 million last year. The improvement resulted from increased profit associated with our 40% share of the operating income in the Discovery Family Channel as well as lower losses from foreign exchange transactions. 
The 2015 underlying tax rate was essentially flat with last year at 26.4% versus 26.5%. Our 2016 tax rate is anticipated to remain in the range of 26.5% to 27%. This will fluctuate to reflect the geographic mix of profit. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.51 versus $3.15 in 2014. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Of our nearly $1 billion in cash at year end, almost all of it is located outside the U.S. We returned $310.7 million to shareholders in 2015. $225.8 million in dividends and $84.9 million in share repurchase. 
We announced today that the board has approved an 11% or $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend. The new quarterly dividend rate of $0.51 per share will be payable May 16 to shareholders of record on May 2. We will continue returning excess cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. 
Receivables at year end were up 11% and DSOs declined 1 day to 75 days. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 23%, equal to the fourth quarter revenue growth, absent FX. Inventories increased 13% versus last year. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 24%, in line with our growing business and entertainment schedules. Our inventory, both at retail and at Hasbro, is of high quality. And we are well positioned to meet demand in 2016. 
In closing, 2015 was an extremely strong year for Hasbro. We continue to make important advances in the execution of our strategy, and we invested in strategic initiatives to drive long-term shareholder value creation. We have positive momentum in our business, and we are well-positioned for 2016 and beyond. We look forward to sharing more with you on Friday at Toy Fair. 
Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

If you look at our gross and operating margins, we believe that they are sustainable at approximately the 2015 levels. And over time, we would hope to continue to expand those. We've talked about the points of leverage that we have in our business in order to expand them over time. Obviously, the growth of our Franchise Brands that enjoy a higher-than-average operating profit margin, the growth of our Entertainment and Licensing business, which as you saw has a very strong operating margin as well. And then, of course, as we continue to grow International markets, particularly Emerging Markets and we get great economy of scales, those begin to approach the company's average operating profit margin. So those 3 levers broadly will enable us over time to continue to expand operating margins. But we do believe that our operating profit margins and gross margins are at a new place and can remain at this higher level beyond 2015."

And as the movie entered the market in the fourth quarter, we talked about how the fourth quarter was about half of the total year's revenues and that was more internationally oriented at about 54% versus the 46% for the U.S. We're also seeing in 2015 Hasbro's market share of STAR WARS growth fairly dramatically because people are really responding to the innovation that we've brought to the product lines, to our role-play products which are selling incredibly well, all the lightsabers of different kinds, including Kylo Ren's lightsaber.

And then of course Nerf Rival, which is launched in a couple of countries, and we'll roll that out in a few more as we move forward. That more -- this is a little bit more of the paintball-like play pattern that are rolling out in markets around the world. So again, the brand is our top brand at the company. And we just wanted to give that perspective because as we had created the Franchise Brand strategy many years ago, we believe that those brands were capable of growing to first hundreds and millions of dollars, and then over time, even larger.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Hasbro's record performance in 2015 reflected the strength of our global teams and the power of our brand blueprint. Through a focus on Franchise Brands and Partner Brands, c",1509,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Hasbro's record performance in 2015 reflected the strength of our global teams and the power of our brand blueprint. Through a focus on Franchise Brands and Partner Brands, consumer insight led innovation and compelling storytelling, we are connecting with consumers more deeply and across more demographics than ever before. 
It has taken us 10 years and significant investment to be in the position of successfully executing our strategy. Today, we are beginning to unlock the full economic value of our brands. The benefits of our strategy are not only delivering revenue gains, but are also driving higher levels of gross and operating margins, which we believe are sustainable for the long term. 
In recognition of the strength of the year and our positive outlook, our board recently voted to raise the quarterly dividend by 11%. This higher dividend reinforces our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. 
Demand for Hasbro initiatives was strong globally last year. Revenues increased 13% absent FX and reflected the strong demand we saw at the local level around the world. On a reported basis, revenues grew 4% despite a significant negative impact from foreign exchange translation. 
Point-of-sale was very strong, growing double digits in developed economies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Spain, Mexico and Australia, as well as in many Emerging Markets where we've received retail data directly from our customers. We ended 2015 with retail inventories in very good shape, reflecting strong sell-through and high-quality merchandise on shelf. 
Our growth drove market share gains in the 11 major countries where we have data according to NPD. In Europe, we took over the #2 market share position. For the full year, Hasbro Franchise Brands revenue grew 7%. Including the impact of currency translation, Franchise Brand revenues declined 2%. The 7% growth was led by increases in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY and MY LITTLE PONY. Our investments in innovation, storytelling and execution around the brand blueprint drove profitable revenue gains, while positioning us for future growth. 
NERF had a record year, increasing 13%, with new insight-driven innovations, including Nerf Modulus and Rival and growth in Zombie Strike and N-Strike Elite. NERF was the largest brand across Hasbro last year. 
For the third year in a row, PLAY-DOH delivered record revenues, increasing 32%. We saw strong growth across all regions, including a 49% increase in Latin America. While DOHVINCI contributed to growth in its first full year, we also experienced double-digit gains in core PLAY-DOH compounds and play sets. 
Growth in MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING contributed to the 8% increase in the Games category absent FX. MAGIC had a very good fourth quarter with the release of Battle for Zendikar, which had the strongest start to a set in the brand's history. 
In addition to higher revenues in our Franchise Brands and several other Hasbro gaming brands, PIE FACE was a clear winner this holiday season and continues to be in high demand at retail. It was recently named, Toy of the Year, in the U.K. You'll learn more about the next innovation for PIE FACE later this week at Toy Fair. 
As expected TRANSFORMERS revenues declined given the difficult comparison with the 2014 theatrical release. The decrease was at the low end of the traditional range following a movie and benefited from the success of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise television programming airing in markets around the world. 
In 2016, the second season of programming will begin airing, including on Cartoon Network in the U.S. segment. Outside the U.S., the markets are actively relaunching the brand, and we plan to extend the success we've seen in the U.S. globally. We believe that there is an opportunity to engage girls around a more immersive franchise story, including anew approach to multi-platform entertainment, which we will be unveiling in the future. 
MY LITTLE PONY remains a vibrant and growing property. The core MY LITTLE PONY brand did extremely well in 2015 with positive revenue growth in several countries backed by strong point-of-sale and the launch of the new Friendship is Magic collectible segment. MY LITTLE PONY has established itself as a major lifestyle brand. And for 2015, it was our top licensed property. We experienced a slowdown in EQUESTRIA GIRLS that offset much of the growth we saw in other areas of the brand. In January 2016, we launched a new mini doll EQUESTRIA GIRLS line, which is off to a very good start.  Overall, MY LITTLE PONY brand engagement is very high across all lines of the business. To maintain this momentum, we are continuing to invest in multi-channel storytelling, while evolving our entertainment strategy to more effectively deliver content. 
The success of our Franchise Brands contributed to the 11% revenue growth in our Entertainment and Licensing segment. Despite a difficult comparison with 2014's TRANSFORMERS movie, consumer product licensing revenues increased. 
Over the past several years, we have built a world-class consumer products organization. We are driving momentum across several brands, including MY LITTLE PONY, TRANSFORMERS and MONOPOLY, delivering cross-category statements at retail, while making inroads in Emerging Markets, including China and Thailand. 
The Entertainment and Licensing segment is benefiting from our ongoing investment in storytelling through episodic television programming, including a multiyear digital streaming deal. 
With the continued growth, the Entertainment and Licensing segment increased to 6% of total revenues and 11% of operating profit. At a 31% operating profit margin, our ongoing investments are positively contributing to the overall operating margin for Hasbro. 
Shifting to our Partner Brands. Several brands delivered strong growth last year. STAR WARS fans around the world have embraced the Force Awakens both in theater and in merchandise. Hasbro's 2015 STAR WARS revenue was on par with past movie years. Nearly half of this revenue was recorded in the fourth quarter given the December 18 movie release. The next wave of Hasbro STAR WARS product is on shelves today and new product will continue to be available in 2016, supporting both the spring home entertainment window for the Force Awakens as well as the December '16 release of Rogue One. Given the level of entertainment and the strong global demand we are seeing, 2016 STAR WARS revenue could be on par with 2015. 
Earlier in 2015, JURASSIC WORLD and MARVEL'S The Avengers: Age of Ultron, both established themselves as top grossing films at the global box office. Each property made strong revenue contributions for Hasbro. 
In total, our Partner Brand revenues were slightly higher than our previous expectation and totaled 28% of revenues. Strong STAR WARS results in the fourth quarter were a major contributor to the over-performance of these brands. We continue to expect Partner Brand revenues to be 20% to 25% of total Hasbro revenues. In the near term, this number is expected to be at the higher end of this range. 
In 2016, Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY's FROZEN fashion dolls and small dolls became available. These products are already on shelves in the U.S. and rolling out internationally. We shipped a very small amount of product in the fourth quarter given the timing of retailer plans. Shipments are now ramping up, and early consumer indications are positive. Great partnership with DISNEY and our global retailers is resulting in a smooth transition with product on shelf beginning in January. We are closely monitoring inventory at retail to ensure this continues in 2016 as revenues grow and we build greater efficiency and profitability into this new business. 
This growth in our Franchise and Partner Brands portfolio drove growth in every region on a constant dollar basis. The U.S. and Canada segment delivered double-digit revenue and operating profit growth.  In 2012, we reorganized our U.S. teams and put in place a plan to drive both top and bottom line growth. 
Over the past several years, this has substantially improved profit leverage and segment operating profit margin. The team has done a tremendous job working with our retail partners to build a robust, growing and profitable business. 
The International segment revenues grew 16%, absent FX, and Emerging Markets increased 15%. We continue to expect modest double-digit growth in the Emerging Markets going forward. Our regional teams are navigating challenging economic environments, but are successfully driving our brands and positioning Hasbro for profitable growth over the long term. 
In closing, 2015 was a very good year for Hasbro. Positive momentum in Hasbro Franchise Brands and our Partner Brands positions us to capitalize on the innovation and entertainment our teams are delivering in 2016 and beyond. 
As Deb will discuss, Hasbro is in a very strong financial position. We continue to strategically invest in brands and initiatives where we see additional revenue and earnings potential, while returning excess cash to shareholders. 
This Friday, February 12, is our Annual Toy Fair Investor Event. We look forward to seeing you in New York and sharing with you our future brand and business initiatives. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"

We have tremendous momentum in our brands, and we're driving profitable growth throughout our business. 
Our global teams faced an extremely challenging currency environments and delivered successful programs to manage retail, consumer and business demands, while improving the profitability of Hasbro. 
In 2015, absent FX, we grew revenues across all operating segments and major geographic regions as well as in both Franchise and Partner Brands. We delivered cost savings, while investing in the future growth of our business. 
Finally, we generated $552 million in operating cash flow, ending the year with close to $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. 
We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities and investing in our business, while returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Today's announced 11% dividend increase, coupled with $479 million in available share repurchase authorizations, enables us to continue on this path. 
Looking at our segments for the full year 2015, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 10%. Excluding a $14 million negative impact from foreign exchange, segment revenues increased 11%.  Growth in the Boys, Games and Preschool categories more than offset a decline in the Girls category. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenue increased 1% behind growth in NERF, PLAY-DOH, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and LITTLEST PET SHOP, which offset the expected decline in TRANSFORMERS. 
Partner Brands: STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD, MARVEL and DISNEY's DESCENDANTS also contributed to the segment's growth. FURBY revenue was down as expected. 
U.S. point-of-sale posted double-digit growth in all categories other than Girls, which declined 2%. Retail inventory was of very good quality at year end. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 29% for the year, reflecting higher revenues, the impact of cost-saving activities and a favorable product mix. 
In the International segment, foreign exchange had a negative $379.4 million impact on revenues. Absent this impact, International segment revenues grew 16%, and Emerging Markets increased approximately 15%. Including the impact of FX, revenues decreased 3%; and Emerging Markets revenues decreased 9%. 
Internationally, as reported revenues in the Boys and Preschool categories increased but were more than offset by declines in the Games and Girls categories. Franchise Brand revenues declined 6% despite growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF and MONOPOLY. 
Additionally, STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD, MARVEL and DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS were positive contributors. As expected, FURBY and TRANSFORMERS each had a significant revenue decline for the year. Absent FX, operating profit in the segment increased 12%. On a reported basis, operating profit declined 6%, reflecting the negative foreign exchange impact. 
Foreign exchange is anticipated to negatively impact 2016 as well. At our current expected 2016 rates, our 2015 revenues would have been approximately $100 million less than what we reported. We anticipate approximately 15% to 20% of this impact will fall to the 2016 operating profit line. 
The Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues grew 11%. The segment benefited from a multiyear digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios television programming signed during the first quarter of 2015.  In addition, consumer product licensing revenues increased for the year, overcoming a difficult comparison with TRANSFORMERS movie-related merchandise and revenues. 
Segment operating profit increased 27%, and margin grew 31.4%. We continue to make investments in our consumer products team, digital gaming and storytelling to drive future growth in these higher-profit revenue sources. 
Turning to overall expenses for Hasbro. Growth in royalty-bearing entertainment partner revenues, and, to a lesser extent, the Entertainment and Licensing segment revenue combined to deliver a favorable product mix. This mix, in turn, drove lower cost of sales, which were 37.7% in 2015 versus 39.7% in 2014. In conjunction with the higher Partner Brand revenue mix, royalties increased to 8.5% of revenues. Combined, cost of sales and royalties decreased approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. 
As Brian mentioned, the execution of our strategy and our focus on improved efficiency is creating sustainably higher levels of gross margin for Hasbro. As we look to 2016, as a percent of revenues, we anticipate cost of sales of 38%, and royalties lower at 8%. Operating profit dollars and margin grew year-over-year. Higher revenue and operating expense leverage more than offset investments we are making. 
As we continue to execute our brand blueprint, we are focusing on fewer brands, expanding our Licensing revenues and improving the efficiency of our operations. These changes in our business model are creating more innovative product and higher growth and operating profit margins in our business. To fully execute our strategy, investments in innovation are paramount to our long-term success. 
Product development totaled 5.5% of revenues. This includes the investment in our DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN offerings for which revenues commenced in January in a more meaningful way. We'll also continue to invest in building awareness for our brands. In 2015, advertising declined to 9.2% of revenues. This decline is primarily due to the higher percent of entertainment-backed revenues, which traditionally carry less advertising spend. 
Intangible amortization declined for the year as some of our assets had been fully amortized. Program production cost amortization declined slightly to 1% of revenues. Storytelling is an important element of our brand building. And we will continue investing in content development for television, film and other mediums. 
SD&A increased 8% for the year. A number of factors contributed to the growth in expenses. As we outlined in previous calls and in our November Investor Day, we continue to make strategic investments in our business. This includes investing in the digital platform for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. This is a multiyear investment program, which we believe will expand the potential market for MAGIC over the long term. In addition, our IT expense and depreciation is higher, reflecting our increased investments in improving the efficiency of Hasbro going forward. 
As we outlined in November, these expenses increased in 2015 and will again increase in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, we anticipate they will begin to decline. Compensation expense was also higher, reflecting the strength of our results. We are able to expand operating profit, while making incremental investments given the ongoing focus of our teams on managing expenses and the inherent financial advantages of executing our brand blueprint strategy. 
Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. On an as adjusted basis, other income was $2.5 million compared to an expense of $8.5 million last year. The improvement resulted from increased profit associated with our 40% share of the operating income in the Discovery Family Channel as well as lower losses from foreign exchange transactions. 
The 2015 underlying tax rate was essentially flat with last year at 26.4% versus 26.5%. Our 2016 tax rate is anticipated to remain in the range of 26.5% to 27%. This will fluctuate to reflect the geographic mix of profit. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.51 versus $3.15 in 2014. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Of our nearly $1 billion in cash at year end, almost all of it is located outside the U.S. We returned $310.7 million to shareholders in 2015. $225.8 million in dividends and $84.9 million in share repurchase. 
We announced today that the board has approved an 11% or $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend. The new quarterly dividend rate of $0.51 per share will be payable May 16 to shareholders of record on May 2. We will continue returning excess cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. 
Receivables at year end were up 11% and DSOs declined 1 day to 75 days. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 23%, equal to the fourth quarter revenue growth, absent FX. Inventories increased 13% versus last year. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 24%, in line with our growing business and entertainment schedules. Our inventory, both at retail and at Hasbro, is of high quality. And we are well positioned to meet demand in 2016. 
In closing, 2015 was an extremely strong year for Hasbro. We continue to make important advances in the execution of our strategy, and we invested in strategic initiatives to drive long-term shareholder value creation. We have positive momentum in our business, and we are well-positioned for 2016 and beyond. We look forward to sharing more with you on Friday at Toy Fair.

Obviously, the growth of our Franchise Brands that enjoy a higher-than-average operating profit margin, the growth of our Entertainment and Licensing business, which as you saw has a very strong operating margin as well. And then, of course, as we continue to grow International markets, particularly Emerging Markets and we get greater economy of scale, those begin to approach the company's average operating profit margin. So those 3 levers broadly will enable us over time to continue to expand operating margins. But we do believe that our operating profit margins and gross margins are at a new place and can remain at this higher level beyond 2015."

So we continue to invest, improve and drive our online business. As Deb said, we would expect to see some revenues from the new MAGIC next platform in 2017. But MAGIC is a long-term growth driver for us, and we're very happy to have a brand like that. Also, and we'll talk more about this on Friday that talks to and appeals to a different demographic and psychographic that helps the company to expand our portfolio and deliver value and brands across a number of different demographic."

However, if you look at the fourth quarter or more of the movie-related revenues, the International segment revenues, as a percent, go to 54%. And the U.S. is 46%.

So said differently, sales before the launch of the film were more oriented towards U.S. segment and less in International. And as the movie entered the market in the fourth quarter, we talked about how the fourth quarter was about half of the total year's revenues and that was more internationally oriented at about 54% versus the 46% for the U.S. We're also seeing in 2015 Hasbro's market share of STAR WARS grow fairly dramatically because people are really responding to the innovation that we've brought to the product lines, to our role-play products which are selling incredibly well, all the lightsabers of different kinds, including Kylo Ren's lightsaber. And then, of course, our 3 x 3 quarter inch scale action figure, and then of course, our Black Series. Those are some of our top sellers. And we're rolling out new products and already have for 2016.

And then finally, capital allocation question here. You guys have executed well in the strategy over the last several years. Cash flow is good, and you gave a very good outline here with the same sustainable and than what you're doing on the Licensing and your own brands, can that operating cash flow number of approximating $500 million, should that expand in the not-too-distant future given the visibility and sustainability?"

So we look forward to seeing you then and talking more about that then. With respect to the DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN business, we began very small shipments in the fourth quarter. I think we did talk about DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS being a good contributor to 2015. However, we have been working very closely with DISNEY and our retail partners to ensure that channels are in good shape for everyone. And our expectation is we'll begin to ship that in a more meaningful way in 2016. But we only had very small shipments in 2015."

They've been incredibly supportive. And we're seeing some good, early indications of how our product is selling, it's selling quite well. And then if we talk about NERF, the brand was up both in the quarter as well as full year double digits. And the sell-through was very strong, and it's really around Modulus, around N-Strike and around Zombie Strike are kind of the top performers for the year. And then of course Nerf Rival, which has launched in a couple of countries, and we'll roll that out in a few more as we move forward. That more -- this is a little bit more of a paintball-like play pattern that we are rolling out in markets around the world. So again, the brand is our top brand at the company. And we just wanted to give that perspective because as we had created the Franchise Brand strategy many years ago, we believe that those brands were capable of growing to first hundreds and millions of dollars, and then over time, even larger. And NERF and PLAY-DOH are great examples of brands that have grown significantly over the last few years, and they're among the top brands at the company."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First quarter's revenue, operating profit and net earnings growth reflected a commitment to our strategy and the inherent benefits of focusing on Hasbro's Franchise Brands, key strategic Partner Brands and our ability to execute around the blueprint. 
The global Hasbro teams continue to perform at a very high level, delivering innovative brand experiences informed by global consumer insights and supported by compelling storytelling. We are building deep and relevant brand connections with consumers across broad demographics and geographies. 
First quarter revenues grew 16% and 20% absent FX, driven by Hasbro Franchise Brands, Partner Brands and strength across geographies. Hasbro's global teams delivered in an extremely strong quarter, with double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the U.S. and Canada and International segments. 
Internationally, we grew revenues despite the foreign exchange environment, with strong gains in many developed economies. 
When adjusted for foreign exchange, we posted double-digit revenue growth in all major geographic regions. Emerging market revenues increased 6% absent FX, and we continue to expect these markets to grow revenues double digits absent FX for 2016. 
While consumer demand remains robust, we are beginning to see an impact on some retailers from the ongoing economic challenges. 
Global point-of-sale increased 27% in the quarter, behind double-digit growth in all major regions in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. And double-digit growth in both Toys and Games. 
In the U.S., point-of-sale increased double digits in all categories: Boys, Girls, Games and Preschool with growth in franchise and Partner Brands. 
In addition, according to NPD, through the first 2 months of the year, we continued to gain share in nearly every major market. 
Overall, Franchise Brand revenues grew in the quarter. In total, Toy and Game revenues for Franchise Brands increased 9% absent FX, increasing 12% in the U.S. and Canada segment and 6% in the International segment. 
The first quarter had several unique and expected comparison challenges within the Franchise Brands, which don't change our positive outlook for the full year. 
Q1 was a tough comparison within the Entertainment and Licensing category. Franchise Brand revenues in the segment declined this year versus last year when we recorded revenue for a multi-year digital streaming deal. The agreement includes MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP and TRANSFORMERS programming. This segment also had tough comparisons in consumer products and film revenues related to the 2014 TRANSFORMERS movie recorded last year. 
TRANSFORMERS toy and game revenues were also down versus a very strong first quarter of last year when it benefited from the movie. Franchise Brand POS in the quarter was up high single digits globally and double digits in the U.S., more than overcoming the negative TRANSFORMERS comparison. 
Within our Franchise Brands, NERF and PLAY-DOH continue to deliver strong growth. New innovations from NERF, including Modulus and Rival are performing well and 2016 marks their first full year in the market. 
PLAY-DOH continues to drive growth in play sets and compounds. This year, we are launching an entirely new system of play with PLAY-DOH Town that is now available in the U.S. and rolling out internationally throughout 2016. 
MY LITTLE PONY grew in the U.S. and Canada segment and absent FX in the International segment. We continue to deliver innovative new products, strong licensing programs and compelling entertainment, including the 6 season of MY LITTLE PONY Friendship is Magic, which began airing March 26. 
In addition, the launch of the new EQUESTRIA GIRLS many doll segment is off to a strong start. We are working through some retail inventory within EQUESTRIA GIRLS, but we are optimistic about the initial reaction to our new offering and the overall outlook for MY LITTLE PONY globally. 
As I mentioned, TRANSFORMERS revenue represented the most significant decline within our Franchise Brands for the quarter. New entertainment began late in the first quarter of this year, with the second season of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and currently rolling out internationally. 
Machinima and Hasbro are unveiling all new entertainment targeting the older TRANSFORMERS fan later this year. We're also actively developing the next chapter of the TRANSFORMERS theatrical stories. In February, Paramount pictures dated TRANSFORMERS 5 for release on June 23, 2017, with 2 additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for June of 2018 and 2019. We have global teams of counted individuals working on this multi-year theatrical entertainment and innovation slate. 
Overall, Games' revenue was down slightly in the quarter and flat absent FX. 
PIE FACE continues to be in high demand. We also saw growth in our Digital Gaming Licensing, including YAHTZEE, which is being driven by our mobile gaming license with Scopely. 
DUEL MASTERS, a Japanese trading card game, also contributed to growth in the quarter. We are investing to build great gaming experiences in both face-to-face and digital play environment. 
Our outlook for MAGIC: THE GATHERING remains positive. The release schedule fluctuates and revenue timing is story driven, but it is effectively driving engagement with players. We shipped the first set in the Shadows Over Innistrad Block on April 8 versus the first quarter release last year. It is off to a fabulous start with prerelease attendance up 20% and this validates our change to a 2-set block. MAGIC recently achieved the milestone of 1 million active players in our organized play system. 
We also have 65,000 players who play in premier events stream to ease sports audiences. This is an area we're investing in to both grow the number of events and the player base. 
The team at Wizards of the Coast is doing great work to foster both analog and digital play for the MAGIC community. We're very pleased to have Chris Cox from Microsoft joining us as President of Wizards of the Coast. 
As we announced last week, Greg Lead is leaving Hasbro. We are grateful for his contributions and wish him the best in his new endeavors. 
The first quarter also benefits from the strength of our Partner Brands. Retail and consumer demand for STAR WARS remained very high and at this early stage of the year, we continue to believe 2016 revenues could be in line with last year. 
STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was recently released in home entertainment and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is scheduled for release on December 16. 
The first quarter also marked the on shelf date for Hasbro's lineup DISNEY PRINCESS and Disney FROZEN fashion dolls and small dolls. Initial consumer reaction has been very positive and our approach of offering the entire range of DISNEY PRINCESS is resonating. 
New content and the all new characters of the Moana and Elena of Avalor will further support our innovative products this year. 
In addition, Marvel's Captain America: Civil War will be in theaters on May 6. We have a robust line and strong planned retail promotional activities supporting this film. 
The first quarter was a good start to the year, but we know there's a lot of the year left to deliver. For 2016 and beyond, we have an innovative line of both Hasbro brands and Partner Brands, and we're investing to deliver the best experiences to retailers and consumers globally. This includes continued strategic investment and further development of our capabilities around the brand blueprint, including in storytelling, digital gaming and our consumer product licensing efforts.

The strength of our results reflected the continued momentum in our business and strong execution by our global teams. We grew revenues, operating profit and earnings despite the continued negative impact from foreign exchange and challenging economic environment in some International markets. 
We returned $93.2 million in cash to shareholders and ended then the quarter with a very strong balance sheet, well positioned to support our 2016 growth outlook. 
Looking at our segments for the first quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 28%. The Boys, Girls and Preschool categories posted revenue growth, while the Games category declined slightly. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues increased and Partner Brands further contributed to growth with revenue increases in STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS, FROZEN and DESCENDANTS as well as YOKAI WATCH. 
U.S. point-of-sale posted solid double-digit growth in all categories and retail inventory continue to be a very good quality. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 89%, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher expense levels. 
International segment revenues grew 13%. Excluding the negative $26.7 million impact from foreign exchange, International segment revenues increased 22%. 
Revenue in the segment grew in all 4 product categories: Boys, Girls, Games and Preschool. Franchise Brand revenues were down slightly as reported, but grew absent FX. 
Partner Brands were also positive contributors, including STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN. 
Operating profit in the segment increased 50% to $2.9 million. Profit improvement on higher revenues was partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we also took a $13.8 million bad debt provision for potentially uncollectible receivables. This was the first significant provision taken since we began our expansion in 2008 and to more International territories, notably Emerging Markets. 
Overall, we feel we've taken the appropriate risks and managed our higher risk accounts very closely. 
Current exchange rates in certain regions have changed favorably since the beginning of this year. Although the euro has strengthened, other currencies continue to weaken in the quarter. 
For the full year, we forecasted an approximate $100 million negative impact from foreign exchange compared to 2015. If rates, in particular, the euro stay favorable, that impact would be much lower. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues declined 30%. In the first quarter of last year, the segment benefited from a multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios television programming. 
Consumer product Licensing and Entertainment revenues also declined in the quarter, most notably from the difficult comparison with last year's TRANSFORMERS movie related merchandise and revenues. 
Licensing revenues generally recorded in rears and last year's first quarter reflected the holiday 2014 TRANSFORMERS movie related revenue. 
Segment operating profit declined 67%.  In addition to lower revenue, we continue to make investments in our consumer products teams: Digital gaming and storytelling to drive future growth in these higher profit margin revenue sources. These are strategically important capabilities, which truly differentiates Hasbro's brands with both consumers and retailers. 
Turning to overall expenses. Higher revenues drove improved expense leverage and a 270 basis point increase in operating profit margin for the quarter. 
We continue to see growth in Partner Brands, which drive a lower cost of sales to revenue and higher royalty to sales ratios. Both measures were close to flat with last year levels as cost of sales for the quarter were 34.9% of revenues and royalties totaled 8.4%. 
Product development dollar growth reflects continued investment in innovation across our brand portfolio, including franchise, partners and new brands. Advertising remained approximately flat as a percentage of sales and intangible amortization declined reflecting some of our digital gaming assets becoming fully amortized in the second quarter of last year. 
Total production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. In the first quarter of last year, this line reflected the higher revenue and associated amortization with our streaming deal for Hasbro programming. 
SD&A in the quarter was down as a percent of revenues. SD&A dollars increased 12%, primarily due to investments around our brand blueprint, bad debt and higher compensation expense. 
Our first quarter results support our ability to sustain and grow operating profit levels over time. While achieving this, we continue to make incremental investments in our brands, including in the digital ecosystem for MAGIC: THE GATHERING, in our IT systems to drive efficiencies and enhance innovation and in our talent and capabilities to execute our brand blueprint. 
In the first quarter, the strength of our business enabled us to deliver operating profit expansion, while investing for future growth. 
Turning to our results, below operating profit for the quarter. Other expense was $2.7 million versus income of $4.7 million last year. Increased profits associated with our 40% share of the operating income in the Discovery Family Channel, combined with higher interest income in our investments was more than offset by larger losses from foreign exchange transactions. 
The underlying tax rate was 26.5%, down from 27% last year and essentially in line with 26.4% for the full year 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.38 compared to $0.21 last year. Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash totaled $1.1 billion at quarter end. We generated $294 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and $531 million over the past 12 months. 
During the first quarter, we returned $93.2 million to shareholders, $57.4 million in dividends and $35.8 million in share repurchases. 
Our May 16 dividend payment will be the first quarter at the higher dividend rate of $0.51 per share, which the Board increased 11% in February. 
Receivables at quarter end were up 19% versus the 16% growth in revenues and DSOs increased 2 days to 73 days. 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 23% versus 20% revenue growth absent FX. 
Overall, our accounts receivable are in good condition and collections continue to be strong. 
Inventories increased 36% versus last year. Adjusting for negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 41%, reflecting the new businesses we're supporting, the timing of entertainment and our outlook for 2016. 
Overall, we believe we have the right amount and quality of inventory at retail and at Hasbro to meet our growth expectations for the year. 
Throughout the first quarter, we maintained and improved upon the higher level of performance we delivered last year. While we have a great deal of the year left to go, we're well positioned to capitalize on innovation and entertainment driving our brands. 
Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

The change at MAGIC, at Wizards of the Coast was planned some time ago. Gregg had indicated his desire to go off and do some other things, and we wish him all the best. He's done a terrific job for us. He was here in Providence and Pawtucket before going to Wizard to run our Boys business and he's been here with us for several years.

So if you take that out, our total Franchise Brands growth for the quarter was 9%, and you saw double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single digit growth internationally for Franchise Brands.

In terms of the MARVEL business, I think the interesting thing here is we do have of will be coming up in Captain America: Civil War. Hopefully, you've seen the materials there, but it's clearly a full array of all of our favorite characters from the MARVEL universe. Interestingly, the timing of the merchandising of that is a month later this year that it was a year ago, and so that does have an impact on the first quarter's MARVEL business as we time. Just happens to be the the shelf safe dates are a month later this year than a year ago although the movie dates are roughly the same.

We had a number of our Girls brands that performed well and grew in the quarter, so we saw some great growth from some of what we would call our Challenger brands, including FurReal Friends, BABY ALIVE and EASY BAKE and then MY LITTLE PONY, as I said, the brand overall was up. The only place that it had an impact where it flattens the result is because of the streaming revenues that were assigned to the purchase of MY LITTLE PONY programming and LITTLEST PET SHOP programming a year ago. So we had one brand in there that we're restaging for the fall, which is NERF REBELLE and clearly, the brand is down at this moment as we restage and get reoriented around that brand for the second half of the year. And again, PET SHOP had very strong results in several territories, including the U.S. and Canada, and we're beginning to make the shift, the change and evolution of that brand out internationally and overtime, we would expect that brand to see more positive momentum overall."

  Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First quarter's revenue, operating profit and net earnings growth reflected a commitment to our strategy and the inherent benefits of focusing on Hasbro's Franchise Brands, key strategic Partner Brands and our ability to execute around the blueprint.
The global Hasbro teams continue to perform at a very high level, delivering innovative brand experiences informed by global consumer insights and supported by compelling storytelling. We are building deep and relevant brand connections with consumers across broad demographics and geographies. 
First quarter revenues grew 16% and 20% absent FX, driven by Hasbro Franchise Brands, Partner Brands and strength across geographies. Hasbro's global teams delivered in an extremely strong quarter, with double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the U.S. and Canada and International segments.
Internationally, we grew revenues despite the foreign exchange environment, with strong gains in many developed economies.
When adjusted for foreign exchange, we posted double-digit revenue growth in all major geographic regions. Emerging market revenues increased 6% absent FX, and we continue to expect these markets to grow revenues double digits absent FX for 2016. 
While consumer demand remains robust, we are beginning to see an impact on some retailers from the ongoing economic challenges.
Global point-of-sale increased 27% in the quarter, behind double-digit growth in all major regions: North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific and double-digit growth in both Toys and Games.
In the U.S., point-of-sale increased double digits in all categories: Boys, Girls, Games and Preschool with growth in Franchise and Partner Brands.
In addition, according to NPD, through the first 2 months of the year, we continued to gain share in nearly every major market.
Overall, Franchise Brand revenues grew in the quarter. In total, Toy and Game revenues for Franchise Brands increased 9% absent FX, increasing 12% in the U.S. and Canada segment and 6% in the International segment.
The first quarter had several unique and expected comparison challenges within the Franchise Brands, which don't change our positive outlook for the full year.
Q1 was a tough comparison within the Entertainment and Licensing category. Franchise Brand revenues in the segment declined this year versus last year when we recorded revenue for a multi-year digital streaming deal. The agreement includes MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP and TRANSFORMERS programming. This segment also had tough comparisons in consumer products and film revenues related to the 2014 TRANSFORMERS movie recorded last year. 
TRANSFORMERS Toy and Game revenues were also down versus a very strong first quarter of last year when it benefited from the movie. Franchise Brand POS in the quarter was up high single digits globally and double digits in the U.S., more than overcoming the negative TRANSFORMERS comparison.
Within our Franchise Brands, NERF and PLAY-DOH continue to deliver strong growth. New innovations from NERF, including Modulus and Rival are performing well, and 2016 marks their first full year in the market.
PLAY-DOH continues to drive growth in play sets and compounds. This year, we are launching an entirely new system of play with PLAY-DOH Town that is now available in the U.S. and rolling out internationally throughout 2016.
MY LITTLE PONY grew in the U.S. and Canada segment and absent FX in the International segment. We continue to deliver innovative new products, strong licensing programs and compelling entertainment, including the 6 season of MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic, which began airing March 26.
In addition, the launch of the new EQUESTRIA GIRLS mini doll segment is off to a strong start. We are working through some retail inventory within EQUESTRIA GIRLS, but we are optimistic about the initial consumer reaction to our new offering and the overall outlook for MY LITTLE PONY globally.
As I mentioned, TRANSFORMERS revenue represented the most significant decline within our Franchise Brands for the quarter. New entertainment began late in the first quarter of this year, with the second season of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and currently rolling out internationally.
Machinima and Hasbro are unveiling all new entertainment targeting the older TRANSFORMERS' fan later this year. We're also actively developing the next chapter of the TRANSFORMERS theatrical stories. 
In February, Paramount pictures dated TRANSFORMERS 5 for release on June 23, 2017, with 2 additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for June of 2018 and 2019. We have global teams of talented individuals working on this multi-year theatrical entertainment and innovation slate.
Overall, Games' revenue was down slightly in the quarter and flat absent FX.
PIE FACE continues to be in high demand. We also saw growth in our digital gaming licensing, including YAHTZEE, which is being driven by our mobile gaming license with Scopely.
DUEL MASTERS, a Japanese trading card game, also contributed to growth in the quarter. We are investing to build great gaming experiences in both face-to-face and digital play environments.
Our outlook for MAGIC: THE GATHERING remains positive. The release schedule fluctuates and revenue timing is story driven, but it is effectively driving engagement with players. We shipped the first set in the Shadows Over Innistrad block on April 8 versus the first quarter release last year. It is off to a fabulous start with prerelease attendance up 20%, and this validates our change to a 2-set block. MAGIC recently achieved the milestone of 1 million active players in our organized play system.
We also have 65,000 players who play in premier events stream to Esports audiences. This is an area we're investing in to both grow the number of events and the player base.
The team at Wizards of the Coast is doing great work to foster both analog and digital play for the MAGIC community. We're very pleased to have Chris Cox from Microsoft joining us as President of Wizards of the Coast. 
As we announced last week, Greg Leeds is leaving Hasbro. We are grateful for his contributions, and wish him the best in his new endeavors. 
The first quarter also benefits from the strength of our Partner Brands. Retail and consumer demand for STAR WARS remained very high, and at this early stage of the year, we continue to believe 2016 revenues could be in line with last year.
STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was recently released in home entertainment and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is scheduled for release on December 16. 
The first quarter also marked the on-shelf date for Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and Disney frozen fashion dolls and small dolls. Initial consumer reaction has been very positive, and our approach of offering the entire range of DISNEY PRINCESS is resonating.
New content and the all new characters of the Moana and Elena of Avalor will further support our innovative products this year.
In addition, Marvel's Captain America: Civil War will be in theaters on May 6. We have a robust line and strong planned retail promotional activity supporting this film.
The first quarter was a good start to the year, but we know there is a lot of the year left to deliver. For 2016 and beyond, we have an innovative line of both Hasbro brands and Partner Brands, and we are investing to deliver the best experiences to retailers and consumers globally. This includes continued strategic investment and further development of our capabilities around the brand blueprint, including in storytelling, digital gaming and our consumer products licensing efforts.

  Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter was a very good quarter for Hasbro. The strength of our results reflected the continued momentum in our business and strong execution by our global teams. We grew revenues, operating profit and earnings, despite the continued negative impact from foreign exchange and challenging economic environments in some International markets.
We returned $93.2 million in cash to shareholders and ended the quarter, with a very strong balance sheet, well positioned to support our 2016 growth outlook.
Looking at our segments for the first quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 28%. The Boys, Girls and Preschool categories posted revenue growth, while the Games category declined slightly. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues increased, and Partner Brands further contributed to growth, with revenue increases in STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS, FROZEN and DESCENDANTS as well as YOKAI WATCH. 
U.S. point-of-sale posted solid double-digit growth in all categories, and retail inventory continued to be a very good quality. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 89%, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher expense levels.
International segment revenues grew 13%. Excluding the negative $26.7 million impact from foreign exchange, International segment revenues increased 22%.
Revenue in the segment grew in all 4 product categories: Boys, Girls, Games and Preschool. 
Franchise Brand revenues were down slightly as reported, but grew absent FX.  Partner Brands were also positive contributors, including STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN.
Operating profit in the segment increased 50% to $2.9 million. Profit improvement on higher revenues was partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year.
During the quarter, we also took a $13.8 million bad debt provision for potentially uncollectible receivables. This was the first significant provision taken since we began our expansion in 2008 into more International territories, notably emerging markets.
Overall, we feel we've taken the appropriate risks and managed our higher risk accounts very closely.
Current exchange rates in certain regions have changed favorably since the beginning of this year. Although the euro has strengthened, other currencies continue to weaken in the quarter.
For the full year, we forecasted an approximate $100 million negative impact from foreign exchange compared to 2015. If rates, in particular, the euro stay favorable, that impact would be much lower.
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues declined 30%. In the first quarter of last year, the segment benefited from a multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios television programming.  
Consumer product Licensing and Entertainment revenues also declined in the quarter, most notably from the difficult comparison with last year's TRANSFORMERS movie-related merchandise and revenues.
Licensing revenue is generally recorded in rears [ph] and last year's first quarter reflected the holiday 2014 TRANSFORMERS movie-related revenue. 
Segment operating profit declined 67%.  In addition to lower revenue, we continue to make investments in our consumer products team digital gaming and storytelling to drive future growth in these higher profit margin revenue sources. These are strategically important capabilities, which truly differentiate Hasbro's brands with both consumers and retailers.
Turning to overall expenses. Higher revenues drove improved expense leverage and a 270 basis point increase in operating profit margin for the quarter. 
We continue to see growth in Partner Brands, which drive a lower cost of sales to revenue and higher royalty to sales ratios. Both measures were close to flat with last year levels, as cost of sales for the quarter were 34.9% of revenues and royalties totaled 8.4%.
Product development dollar growth reflects continued investment in innovation across our brand portfolio, including Franchise, Partner and new brands. Advertising remained approximately flat as a percentage of sales, and intangible amortization declined, reflecting some of our digital gaming assets becoming fully amortized in the second quarter of last year.
Program production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. In the first quarter of last year, this line reflected the higher revenue and associated amortization with our streaming deal for Hasbro programming.
SD&A in the quarter was down as a percent of revenues. SD&A dollars increased 12%, primarily due to investments around our brand blueprint, bad debt and higher compensation expense.
Our first quarter results support our ability to sustain and grow operating profit levels over time. While achieving this, we continue to make incremental investments in our brands, including in the digital ecosystem for MAGIC: THE GATHERING, in our IT systems to drive efficiencies and enhance innovation and in our talent and capabilities to execute our brand blueprint.
In the first quarter, the strength of our business enabled us to deliver operating profit expansion, while investing for future growth.
Turning to our results the low operating profit for the quarter. Other expense was $2.7 million versus income of $4.7 million last year. Increased profits associated with our 40% share of the operating income in the Discovery Family Channel, combined with higher interest income on our investments, was more than offset by larger losses from foreign exchange transactions.
The underlying tax rate was 26.5%, down from 27% last year and essentially in line with 26.4% for the full year 2015.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.38 compared to $0.21 last year. Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash totaled $1.1 billion at quarter end. We generated $294 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and $531 million over the past 12 months.
During the first quarter, we returned $93.2 million to shareholders: $57.4 million in dividends and $35.8 million in share repurchases. 
Our May 16 dividend payment will be the first quarter at the higher dividend rate of $0.51 per share, which the board increased 11% in February.
Receivables at quarter end were up 19% versus the 16% growth in revenues and, DSOs increased 2 days to 73 days. 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 23% versus 20% revenue growth absent FX.
Overall, our accounts receivable are in good condition, and collections continue to be strong. 
Inventories increased 36% versus last year. Adjusting for negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 41%, reflecting the new businesses we're supporting, the timing of entertainment and our outlook for 2016.
Overall, we believe we have the right amount and quality of inventory at retail and at Hasbro to meet our growth expectations for the year.
Throughout the first quarter, we maintained and improved upon the higher level of performance we delivered last year. While we have a great deal of the year left to go, we're well positioned to capitalize on the innovation and entertainment driving our brands.

If you look at Games within the business, we'll call it face-to-face gaming, was up a bit, but MAGIC was down in the quarter, and we've talked a lot. Hopefully, people now understand that MAGIC really is release-driven, story-driven, and therefore, we'll have ups and downs that may not run seasonally as much as other brands, but rather just in response to the story releases and the decks that are released. The change at MAGIC, at Wizards of the Coast was planned some time ago. Greg had indicated desire to go off and do some other things, and we wish him all the best. He's done a terrific job for us. He was here in Providence and Pawtucket before going to Wizards to run our Boys business, and he's been here with us for several years. We're very excited about Chris Cox coming onboard, and he'll be with us starting in June. And not only is he a MAGIC: THE GATHERING player and role playing gamer overall but he's also got some tremendous experience most recently at Microsoft. So he has both the analog and digital capability, and that will continue to drive us in both directions."

  We definitely saw a very strong Easter for us in POS, but our Easter was actually up significantly versus prior Easter. But we've seen this continued strong POS even after Easter this year. Our POS continues to be strong, and the double-digit POS is across every category in every geography. And I think it goes back to something we talked about in prepared remarks, and that's we -- I think that thing that you're seeing in the first quarter that's obfuscating our otherwise very strong Franchise Brand results. It's just the payments that were made a year ago for stream content in a quarter that tends to be a bit lower in overall revenue. So it has a bigger impact. If we take that out, our total Franchise Brands growth for the quarter was 9%, and you saw double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single digit growth internationally for Franchise Brands. So again, that streaming payments made a year ago just get in the way of seeing that underlying strength, and it's why you're also seeing our market shares grow all around the world."

  Yes. So if you look at the full year for STAR WARS in the calendar, clearly, Home Entertainment has just broken for The Force Awakens. Obviously, we know the kind of contribution that will make to boys-oriented business for the next several quarters. Then we transition in the fall toward Rogue One. Hopefully, by now, you've seen one of the early trailers. It's very exciting, and clearly a story -- a STAR WARS story that is very relevant to global fans, both new and old and will transition to the Rogue One product. But of course, still the classic products, both from Force Awakens and classic original STAR WARS products will continue to sell. We also have a continued strong emphasis on the fan economy and fan-oriented product, which continues throughout the year, and you'll see that reflected. We're seeing it reflected in our business presently, and that's, I think how you look at the calendarization of STAR WARS for this year. In terms of the MARVEL business, I think the interesting thing here is we do have a movie coming up in Captain America: Civil War. Hopefully, you've seen the materials there, but it's clearly a full array of all of our favorite characters from the MARVEL Universe. Interestingly, the timing of the merchandising of that is a month later this year than it was a year ago, and so that does have an impact on the first quarter's MARVEL business as we time that just happens to be the shelf set dates are a month later this year than a year ago although the movie dates roughly the same. And we'll roll into Captain America: Civil War, which as I said is a full array of characters, including some of our favorites like the character you mentioned. And then, of course, we get into '17, and we do have the Spider-Man movie."

So the one item we did want to point out was the bad debt. That was about unusual for us. While we won't exclude it, it was the first one that we've encountered as we've expanded, particularly into emerging markets. And we do have some high-risk accounts, but we manage those very closely and do have reserves, where we deem them appropriate. But overall, our margins have grown in all of our segments, with the exception of Entertainment and Licensing. And again, that streaming revenue, because of the profitability of it, has a big impact.

  Well, if you look at it, clearly, in a quarter, where typically lower revenues, it does have a disproportional impact. As you grow throughout the year, your revenues grow across the board. We had a number of our Girls brands that performed well and grew in the quarter. So we saw some great growth from some of what we would call our Challenger Brands, including FurReal Friends, Baby Alive and EASY BAKE. And then MY LITTLE PONY, as I said, the brand overall was up. The only place that had an impact, where it flattens the result, is because of the streaming revenues that are assigned to the purchase of MY LITTLE PONY programming and LITTLEST PET SHOP programming a year ago. So we had one brand in there that we're restaging for the fall, which is NERF REBELLE. And clearly, the brand is down at this moment as we restage and get reoriented around that brand for the second half of the year. And again, PET SHOP had very strong results in several territories, including the U.S. and Canada. And we're beginning to make the shift, the change and evolution of that brand out internationally. And over time, we would expect that brand to see more positive momentum overall."

  Well, I would say yes to really everything you've said. Well, remember that last year, we had a very robust growth in U.S. and globally, developed economies as well as emerging markets in the Toy industry. So I would say this is the second year of strong growth year-to-date. We're seeing high single-digit growth rates, both in developed economies like U.S. and also throughout Europe. Retailers are very excited about the category as we continue to have more story-driven brands, more integrated play brands and more innovation in the category. Overall, POS was very strong, as I said. But as we've noted before, online POS was even stronger, and many additional retailers that have been historically BRIC retailers are doing a very good job in omni-channel. And so we saw great growth for several online retailers, both pure play as well as omni-channel retailers. So I would say, overall, the state of the industry is quite strong, and our indications are from projections that it will remain strong for the next several years."

So we've only really seen entertainment in the U.S., and it will be going into international markets throughout the year. And early indications are quite good, but it's still very early days.

And I think we continue to offer on array of products for all STAR WARS fans of all ages and genders and affiliations, and you'll see us continue to focus on product for everyone. And product has been well received by everyone. And again, I think what you're seeing overall is a blending of such more historical delineation that we're really not focusing on or fostering. We're just making great products. We love the lead characters of these movies, and we're very excited about where STAR WARS is going. We also saw in the first quarter great sales of light sabers.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First quarter's revenue, operating profit and net earnings growth reflected a commitment to our strategy and the inherent benefits of focusing on Hasbro's Franchise Brands, key strategic Partner Brands and our ability to execute around the blueprint.
The global Hasbro teams continue to perform at a very high level, delivering innovative brand experiences informed by global consumer insights and supported by compelling storytelling. We are building deep and relevant brand connections with consumers across broad demographics and geographies. 
First quarter revenues grew 16% and 20% absent FX, driven by Hasbro Franchise Brands, Partner Brands and strength across geographies. Hasbro's global teams delivered in an extremely strong quarter, with double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the U.S. and Canada and International segments.
Internationally, we grew revenues despite the foreign exchange environment, with strong gains in many developed economies.
When adjusted for foreign exchange, we posted double-digit revenue growth in all major geographic regions. Emerging market revenues increased 6% absent FX, and we continue to expect these markets to grow revenues double digits absent FX for 2016. 
While consumer demand remains robust, we are beginning to see an impact on some retailers from the ongoing economic challenges.
Global point-of-sale increased 27% in the quarter, behind double-digit growth in all major regions: North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific and double-digit growth in both Toys and Games.
In the U.S., point-of-sale increased double digits in all categories: Boys, Girls, Games and Preschool with growth in Franchise and Partner Brands.
In addition, according to NPD, through the first 2 months of the year, we continued to gain share in nearly every major market.
Overall, Franchise Brand revenues grew in the quarter. In total, Toy and Game revenues for Franchise Brands increased 9% absent FX, increasing 12% in the U.S. and Canada segment and 6% in the International segment.
The first quarter had several unique and expected comparison challenges within the Franchise Brands, which don't change our positive outlook for the full year.
Q1 was a tough comparison within the Entertainment and Licensing category. Franchise Brand revenues in the segment declined this year versus last year when we recorded revenue for a multi-year digital streaming deal. The agreement includes MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP and TRANSFORMERS programming. This segment also had tough comparisons in consumer products and film revenues related to the 2014 TRANSFORMERS movie recorded last year. 
TRANSFORMERS Toy and Game revenues were also down versus a very strong first quarter of last year when it benefited from the movie. Franchise Brand POS in the quarter was up high single digits globally and double digits in the U.S., more than overcoming the negative TRANSFORMERS comparison.
Within our Franchise Brands, NERF and PLAY-DOH continued to deliver a strong growth. New innovations from NERF, including Modulus and Rival are performing well, and 2016 marks their first full year in the market.
PLAY-DOH continues to drive growth in play sets and compounds. This year, we are launching an entirely new system of play with PLAY-DOH Town that is now available in the U.S. and rolling out internationally throughout 2016.
MY LITTLE PONY grew in the U.S. and Canada segment and absent FX in the International segment. We continue to deliver innovative new product, strong licensing programs and compelling entertainment, including the sixth season of MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic, which began airing March 26.
In addition, the launch of the new EQUESTRIA GIRLS mini doll segment is off to a strong start. We are working through some retail inventory within EQUESTRIA GIRLS, but we are optimistic about the initial consumer reaction to our new offering and the overall outlook for MY LITTLE PONY globally.
As I mentioned, TRANSFORMERS revenue represented the most significant decline within our Franchise Brands for the quarter. New entertainment began late in the first quarter of this year, with the second season of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and currently rolling out internationally.
Machinima and Hasbro are unveiling all new entertainment targeting the older TRANSFORMERS' fan later this year. We're also actively developing the next chapter of the TRANSFORMERS theatrical stories. 
In February, Paramount pictures dated TRANSFORMERS 5 for release on June 23, 2017, with 2 additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for June of 2018 and 2019. We have global teams of talented individuals working on this multi-year theatrical entertainment and innovation slate.
Overall, Games' revenue was down slightly in the quarter and flat absent FX.
PIE FACE continues to be in high demand. We also saw growth in our digital gaming licensing, including YAHTZEE, which is being driven by our mobile gaming license with Scopely.
DUEL MASTERS, a Japanese trading card game, also contributed to growth in the quarter. We are investing to build great gaming experiences in both face-to-face and digital play environments.
Our outlook for MAGIC: THE GATHERING remains positive. The release schedule fluctuates and revenue timing is story driven, but it is effectively driving engagement with players. We shipped the first set in the Shadows Over Innistrad block on April 8 versus a first quarter release last year. It is off to a fabulous start with prerelease attendance up 20%, and this validates our change to a 2-set block. MAGIC recently achieved the milestone of 1 million active players in our organized play system.
We also have 65,000 players who play in premier events streamed to Esports audiences. This is an area we're investing in to both grow the number of events and the player base.
The team at Wizards of the Coast is doing great work to foster both analog and digital play for the MAGIC community. We're very pleased to have Chris Cox from Microsoft joining us as President of Wizards of the Coast. 
As we announced last week, Greg Leeds is leaving Hasbro. We are grateful for his contributions, and wish him the best in his new endeavors. 
The first quarter also benefited from the strength of our Partner Brands. Retail and consumer demand for STAR WARS remained very high, and at this early stage of the year, we continue to believe 2016 revenues could be in line with last year.
STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was recently released in home entertainment and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is scheduled for release on December 16. 
The first quarter also marked the on-shelf date for Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN fashion dolls and small dolls. Initial consumer reaction has been very positive, and our approach of offering the entire range of DISNEY PRINCESS is resonating.
New content and the all new characters of the Moana and Elena of Avalor will further support our innovative products this year.
In addition, Marvel's Captain America: Civil War will be in theaters on May 6. We have a robust line and strong planned retail promotional activity supporting this film.
The first quarter was a good start to the year, but we know there is a lot of the year left to deliver. For 2016 and beyond, we have an innovative line of both Hasbro Brands and Partner Brands, and we are investing to deliver the best experiences to retailers and consumers globally. This includes continued strategic investment and further development of our capabilities around the brand blueprint, including in storytelling, digital gaming and our consumer products licensing efforts.

The strength of our results reflected the continued momentum in our business and strong execution by our global teams. We grew revenues, operating profit and earnings, despite the continued negative impact from foreign exchange and challenging economic environments in some International markets.
We returned $93.2 million in cash to shareholders and ended the quarter, with a very strong balance sheet, well positioned to support our 2016 growth outlook.
Looking at our segments for the first quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 28%. The Boys, Girls and Preschool categories posted revenue growth, while the Games category declined slightly. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues increased, and Partner Brands further contributed to growth, with revenue increases in STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS, FROZEN and DESCENDANTS as well as YOKAI WATCH. 
U.S. point-of-sale posted solid double-digit growth in all categories, and retail inventory continued to be of very good quality. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 89%, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher expense levels.
International segment revenues grew 13%. Excluding the negative $26.7 million impact from foreign exchange, International segment revenues increased 22%.
Revenue in the segment grew in all 4 product categories: Boys, Games, Girls and Preschool. 
Franchise Brand revenues were down slightly as reported, but grew absent FX.  Partner Brands were also positive contributors, including STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN.
Operating profit in the segment increased 50% to $2.9 million. Profit improvement on higher revenues was partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year.
During the quarter, we also took a $13.8 million bad debt provision for potentially uncollectible receivables. This was the first significant provision taken since we began our expansion in 2008 into more International territories, notably emerging markets.
Overall, we feel we've taken the appropriate risks and manage our higher risk accounts very closely.
Current exchange rates in certain regions have changed favorably since the beginning of this year. Although the euro has strengthened, other currencies continued to weaken in the quarter.
For the full year, we forecasted an approximate $100 million negative impact from foreign exchange compared to 2015. If rates, in particular the euro, stay favorable that impact would be much lower.
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues declined 30%. In the first quarter of last year, the segment benefited from a multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios television programming.  
Consumer product Licensing and Entertainment revenues also declined in the quarter, most notably from the difficult comparison with last year's TRANSFORMERS movie-related merchandise and revenues.
Licensing revenue is generally recorded in arrears  and last year's first quarter reflected the holiday 2014 TRANSFORMERS movie-related revenue. 
Segment operating profit declined 67%.  In addition to lower revenue, we continue to make investments in our consumer products team, digital gaming and storytelling to drive future growth in these higher profit margin revenue sources. These are strategically important capabilities, which truly differentiate Hasbro's brands with both consumers and retailers.
Turning to overall expenses. Higher revenues drove improved expense leverage and a 270 basis point increase in operating profit margin for the quarter. 
We continue to see growth in Partner Brands, which drive a lower cost of sales to revenue and higher royalty to sales ratios. Both measures were close to flat with last year levels, as cost of sales for the quarter were 34.9% of revenues and royalties totaled 8.4%.
Product development dollar growth reflects continued investment in innovation across our brand portfolio, including Franchise, Partner and new brands. Advertising remained approximately flat as a percentage of sales, and intangible amortization declined, reflecting some of our digital gaming assets becoming fully amortized in the second quarter of last year.
Program production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. In the first quarter of last year, this line reflected the higher revenue and associated amortization with our streaming deal for Hasbro programming.
SD&A in the quarter was down as a percent of revenues. SD&A dollars increased 12%, primarily due to investments around our Brand Blueprint, bad debt and higher compensation expense.
Our first quarter results support our ability to sustain and grow operating profit levels over time. While achieving this, we continue to make incremental investments in our brands, including in the digital ecosystem for MAGIC: THE GATHERING, in our IT systems to drive efficiencies and enhance innovation and in our talent and capabilities to execute our brand blueprint.
In the first quarter, the strength of our business enabled us to deliver operating profit expansion, while investing for future growth.
Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. Other expense was $2.7 million versus income of $4.7 million last year. Increased profits associated with our 40% share of the operating income in the Discovery Family Channel, combined with higher interest income on our investments, was more than offset by larger losses from foreign exchange transactions.
The underlying tax rate was 26.5%, down from 27% last year and essentially in line with 26.4% for the full year 2015.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.38 compared to $0.21 last year. Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash totaled $1.1 billion at quarter end. We generated $294 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and $531 million over the past 12 months.
During the first quarter, we returned $93.2 million to shareholders: $57.4 million in dividends and $35.8 million in share repurchases. 
Our May 16 dividend payment will be the first quarter at the higher dividend rate of $0.51 per share, which the board increased 11% in February.
Receivables at quarter end were up 19% versus the 16% growth in revenues, and DSOs increased 2 days to 73 days. 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 23% versus 20% revenue growth absent FX.
Overall, our accounts receivable are in good condition, and collections continue to be strong. 
Inventories increased 36% versus last year. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 41%, reflecting the new businesses we're supporting, the timing of entertainment and our outlook for 2016.
Overall, we believe we have the right amount and quality of inventory at retail and at Hasbro to meet our growth expectations for the year.
Throughout the first quarter, we maintained and improved upon the high level of performance we delivered last year. While we have a great deal of the year left to go, we're well positioned to capitalize on the innovation and entertainment driving our brands.

Hopefully, people now understand that MAGIC really is release-driven, story-driven, and therefore, will have ups and downs that may not run seasonally as much as other brands, but rather just in response to the story releases and the decks that are released. The change at MAGIC, at Wizards of the Coast was planned some time ago. Greg had indicated a desire to go off and do some other things, and we wish him all the best. He's done a terrific job for us. He was here in Providence and Pawtucket before going to Wizards to run our Boys business, and he's been here with us for several years. We're very excited about Chris Cox coming onboard, and he'll be with us starting in June. And not only is he a MAGIC: THE GATHERING player and role playing gamer overall but he's also got some tremendous experience most recently at Microsoft.

And I think it goes back to something we talked about in the prepared remarks, and that's we -- I think that thing that you're seeing in the first quarter that's obfuscating our otherwise very strong Franchise Brand results. It's just the payments that were made a year ago for streamed content in a quarter that tends to be a bit lower in overall revenue. So it has a bigger impact. So if you take that out, our total Franchise Brands growth for the quarter was 9%, and you saw double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single digit growth internationally for Franchise Brands. So again, the streaming payments made a year ago just get in the way of seeing that underlying strength, and it's why you're also seeing our market shares grow all around the world."

So if you look at the full year for STAR WARS in the calendar, clearly, Home Entertainment has just broken for The Force Awakens.

Hopefully, by now, you've seen one of the early trailers. It's very exciting, and clearly a story -- a STAR WARS story that is very relevant to global fans, both new and old and will transition to the Rogue One product. But of course, still the classic products, both from Force Awakens and classic original STAR WARS products will continue to sell. We also have a continued strong emphasis on the fan economy and fan-oriented product, which continues throughout the year, and you'll see that reflected. We're seeing it reflected in our business presently, and that's, I think how you would look at the calendarization of STAR WARS for this year. In terms of the MARVEL business, I think the interesting thing here is we do have a movie coming up in Captain America: Civil War. Hopefully, you've seen the materials there, but it's clearly a full array of all of our favorite characters from the MARVEL Universe. Interestingly, the timing of the merchandising of that is a month later this year than it was a year ago, and so that does have an impact on the first quarter's MARVEL business as we time that. It just happens to be that the shelf set dates are a month later this year than a year ago although the movie dates roughly the same. And we'll roll into Captain America: Civil War, which as I said is a full array of characters, including some of our favorites like the character you mentioned. And then, of course, we get into '17, and we do have the Spider-Man movie."

Retailers are very excited about the category as we continue to have more story-driven brands, more integrated play brands and more innovation in the category. Overall, POS was very strong, as I said. But as we've noted before, online POS was even stronger, and many additional retailers that have been historically brick retailers are doing a very good job in omni-channel. And so we saw great growth for several online retailers, both pure play as well as omni-channel retailers. So I would say, overall, the state of the industry is quite strong, and our indications are, from projections, that it will remain strong for the next several years."

And product has been well received by everyone. And again, I think what you're seeing overall is a blending of such more historical delineation that we're really not focusing on or fostering. We're just making great products. We love the lead characters of these movies, and we're very excited about where STAR WARS is going. We also saw in the first quarter great sales of light sabers.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Through the execution of our Brand Blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across Toy and Games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products.

Through the execution of our Brand Blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across Toy and Games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products. These efforts support our mission of creating the world's best play experiences and are delivering growth in our business. 
Second quarter revenues increased 10% and operating profit grew 12%. Each major segment grew revenues and operating profit. All 4 product categories increased revenues. Consumer take away continued to grow, and we are making investments to enhance our talent and capabilities around the Brand Blueprint. 
Last week, we significantly enhanced our animation capabilities, with the acquisition of Boulder Media. Boulder is a leading animation studio based in Dublin, Ireland. This 150-person team is creating award-winning content for networks around the world. We are very excited to have Boulder join Hasbro as we build a world-class team in storytelling and content creation. 
The acquisition is not expected to have material impact on our 2016 financial results, but strategically, it reflects our mindset of investing in capabilities around the Brand Blueprint. 
Hasbro Franchise Brands increased 3% overall or 5% absent FX, with double-digit growth from both NERF and PLAY-DOH. Revenues from our Partner Brands increased 15%, led by STAR WARS and the addition of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN. 
These brands and future launches, including the introduction of FURBY CONNECT, DreamWorks' Trolls and product supporting the December release of Lucasfilm's Rogue One: A STAR WARS Story position us well heading into the fall and holiday season. 
For the quarter, we grew across geographies, with 11% net revenue gains in both the U.S. and Canada segment and the International segment. Emerging market revenues increased 5% as reported and 13% absent FX. Europe grew 23% in the quarter, including a 25% or greater increase from the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Russia. 
While the U.K. Brexit vote has created some near-term uncertainty and negatively impacted its currency, we have positive momentum in both the U.K. and in Europe heading into the second half of the year.  To-date, we have not seen a negative impact on our business. 
Overall, global point-of-sale increased 6% in the quarter, with growth in the Boys, Girls and Games categories. 
For the first 6 months of the year, POS is up 17%. According to industry and Hasbro estimates, with data available through May, we continue to gain share in nearly every major market. 
In total, we increased our share by approximately 1.2 percentage points. Our portfolio is well positioned for the remainder of 2016 and future years. 
NERF and PLAY-DOH have continued to deliver strong growth. Several other Hasbro brands contributed to the gains, including BABY ALIVE, FurReal Friends and EASY BAKE as well as several Games brands, including PIE FACE, YAHTZEE and BOP-IT. 
MY LITTLE PONY declined slightly in the quarter as we transitioned elements of our toy line. Over the past 5 years, content and innovation has propelled this brand in both Games and Toys and consumer products. 
MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic Season 6 is currently airing around the world and our fall product line features the core cast inspired by the locations they visit. MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS mini dolls have performed very well, exceeding our expectations and are helping offset difficult comparisons to a year ago. 
This leads us to next year when October 6, 2017, MY LITTLE PONY: The Movie will hit theaters with an all-star cast and global distribution from Lionsgate. The film introduces new characters, new worlds and new play experiences for the MY LITTLE PONY fan. 
TRANSFORMERS is also driving a significant business, supported by both television animation and theatrical films. The second season of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise is airing on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and on networks around the world. TRANSFORMERS story is further being developed by an all-new digital streaming series and partnership with Machinima, kicking off in August and aligned to win our toys and consumer products become available. 
TRANSFORMERS' revenue is down versus last year, but we have a rich content and product line for the year and clearly, a strong entertainment calendar and immersive stories and characters moving forward. 
Transformers: The Last Knight is slated for release by Paramount on June 23, 2017 with 2 additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for 2018 and 2019. 
In addition, TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS, the first major Hasbro branded game from Backflip Studios was released on June 2. With over 3 million downloads in the first month, it quickly rose into the top 100 grossing Games in the U.S. 
Through investment in our in-house capabilities and extensive industry-leading partnerships with the best gaming companies across platforms, Hasbro's digital gaming presence continues to grow. With millions of daily active users, consumer spending on Hasbro branded mobile games increased over 80% in the first half of 2016 versus the first half of last year. 
One example of strong year-over-year growth is our YAHTZEE With Buddies Social Dice Game from Scopely. 
Our face-to-face gaming business had a very good quarter behind several brands and play patterns. PIE FACE remains the top-selling game in many markets and point-of-sale is extremely strong. PIE FACE Showdown, which brings the PIE FACE game play to a whole new level will be at select retailers in August and will be widely available in Q4. 
In addition, as we delivered gaming for all platform, PIE FACE is being developed as a standalone mobile game for play on Apple and Android devices and for living room play on Apple TV. 
By responding quickly and bringing games to market in only a few months, we are capturing the excitement created by social media and our face-to-face gaming business. 
Hasbro's newest game, identified through our social listening expertise, is SPEAK OUT. Available this fall, the game captures the excitement around mouthpiece challenged videos. 
In addition, on July 22, MAGIC: THE GATHERING will launch Eldridge Moon, the second set within the Shadows of Innistrad. Shadows is off to a strong start as global prerelease event attendance matched our previous record and are launched weekend event has the highest global participation ever. 
MAGIC revenues grew in the International segment in the second quarter, with strong metrics in all regions. However, plans set release timing shifted this year and created uneven comparisons versus the first half of last year. 
Despite the shift, we expect 2016 to be the eighth straight year of revenue growth for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Its popularity remains unmatched within the strategic trading corp genre, and we are successful expanding global engagement and advancing the game into new formats, including Esports and Digital. 
Within Partner Brands, STAR WARS and DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN represented the largest increases in the quarter. STAR WARS demand remains very strong. During the third quarter, we will begin shipping products in support of the December release of Rogue One. However, the third quarter last year marked the initial shipments for new start STAR WARS products. 
DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN lines are selling very well, both in fashion dolls and the small doll line. We also have plans to launch 2 new properties this year: Elena of Avalor later this summer to support the new DISNEY Channel animated series and Moana in the fourth quarter tied to the theatrical release. 
The transition to our DISNEY PRINCESS dolls product has been smooth overall, and we look forward to a second half of the year as retailers should have transitioned out of previous inventory. 
This year, we have several other great brands we are supporting, including YOKAI WATCH, which has been rolling out in markets globally and the upcoming DreamWorks' release of Trolls. Our Trolls product will begin to hit retail in August ahead of the November 4 premier. 
We have tremendous partnerships with great IP owners. We approached each of these brands as if they were our own, committing to them the best talent, resources and innovative ideas in the industry. 
Looking ahead, we have positive momentum and a powerful line of brands and play experiences for the remainder of 2016 and clear line of sight to growth in future years. We have made tremendous progress in advancing our strategic capabilities to execute brands around the blueprint, but continue to prioritize the further development of our skill set and our culture toward creating the world's best play experiences. 
Deb will speak in detail about our financial results, but we are very pleased with the strength of the first half of the year and remain focused on growing both revenues and profitability to enhance shareholder value over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"

The Hasbro team continued to drive strong results for the second quarter, including double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. We expanded our storytelling capabilities through our investment in Boulder Media and our balance sheet remains strong. We've returned $179 million in cash to shareholders this year and remain committed to investing in our business, returning excess cash and maintaining our investment grade rating. 
For the second quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 11%. The Boys, Girls and Games categories posted revenue growth, more than offsetting a decline in the Preschool category. 
Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues were flat. NERF, MONOPOLY and PLAY-DOH increases were primarily offset by a decline in TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues were up in the segment. U.S. point-of-sale increased in the high single digits for the quarter and more than 20% in the first half of the year. Retail inventory continued to be a very good quality. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 23% to $58 million or 13.6% of net revenues, reflecting higher sales only partially offset by higher expense levels as leverage improved in the quarter. 
International segment revenues grew 11%. Excluding the negative $17 million impact from foreign exchange, International segment revenues increased 15%. 
The Boys, Girls and Preschool categories posted growth in the quarter, while the Games category was down slightly. Franchise Brand revenues increased with growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING.  Partner Brand revenues also grew in the quarter. 
Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $29.7 million or 7.4% of net revenues. Similar to the U.S. and Canada segment, operating profit improved on higher revenues, which were only partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, currency has negatively impacted revenues by $46.3 million. Given the current global economic environment, we anticipate additional negative foreign exchange impact for the second half of the year. However, we now expect it will be slightly below the $100 million we initially projected for the full year. We continue to believe approximately 15% to 20% of that impact will also affect operating profit. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 9%, with gains in consumer product Licensing and digital gaming revenues. Segment operating profit increased 86% to $13.8 million or 26.6% of revenues. Higher revenues, coupled with lower intangible amortization and lower program production amortization drove the increase despite higher promotional expenses associated with digital gaming launches from Backflip Studios. 
Overall, operating profit increased 12% and operating profit margin gained 20 basis points versus last year. The revenue increase from Entertainment and Licensing, Franchise Brands and Partner Brands, delivered a favorable product mix, which drove cost to sales to revenue down 40 basis points versus last year. Royalties increased to 7.9% of revenues associated with continued strong growth in Partner Brands. 
In product development, we continue to invest at a higher level to drive innovative play and grow our brands. We also continue supporting our efforts with multifaceted advertising campaigns. 
Intangible amortization declined, reflecting some of our digital gaming assets becoming fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of last year. Program production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. We continue to invest in both television and film content, but this quarter, we're amortizing fewer television programs than last year at this time. 
SD&A increased 12% in the quarter primarily due to investment in brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, marketing and higher compensation expense. 
Through the first half of the year, operating profit margin has improved to 10%, from 8.6% last year. This game is being driven by the strength of our brands, solid execution from our global teams and continuous strategic investment to drive growth over the long term. 
Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. Other income was $6.1 million versus $2.3 million last year and reflected increased investment gains. The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.1% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.41 compared to $0.33 last year. Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash totaled $924 million at quarter end. We generated $585 million in cash over the past 12 months. 
During the second quarter, we returned $85.8 million to shareholders, $63.9 million in dividends and $21.9 million in share repurchases. Receivables at quarter end were down slightly and DSOs decreased 8 days to 72 days. 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 3% versus the 12% revenue growth absent FX. The decline in DSOs was driven by the timing of revenue and collections in the quarter as well as the bad debt provision we took in the first quarter. 
Overall, our accounts receivable remained in good condition and collections continue to be strong. Inventories increased 42% versus last year. Adjusting for negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 48%. 
Approximately 80% of the year-over-year increases is in brands, which are new to our portfolio or delivering high-growth, including DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, STAR WARS, NERF, PLAY-DOH and YOKAI WATCH. 
The quality of our inventory is high both at Hasbro and at retail as we're supporting new initiatives in addition to our planned growth. 
We entered the second half of the year in a very strong financial and market position. We have compelling brand initiatives and remain focused on delivering a very successful year. 
This strength of our business not only reflects the results of the investments we've made in our blueprint and teams, but more importantly, allows us to continue on our path of strategically investing in our brands and capabilities to further drive long-term profitable growth for Hasbro and our shareholders.

We're also, obviously, seeing overall revenues growth above-market growth, strong double-digit growth for the company. And as we look out to the second half of the year, we have great momentum in our business, great POS momentum as well as momentum across both Franchise and Partner Brands. Our retailers have clearly made plans that involve many of our brands. In fact, if you look at just the quarter and look at the revenue contributors to the quarter, 7 of the top 10 revenue contributors in the quarter where Hasbro brands and the remainder were our Partner Brands, so great balance portfolio of our owned and operated brands plus our Partner Brands. And both NERF and PLAY-DOH were the top 2 brands in terms of overall revenues. So you're clearly seeing a number of strengths in our product portfolio.

But the one thing that did impact our Franchise Brands in the quarter was certainly TRANSFORMERS, and that is because a year ago, we were still selling plenty of TRANSFORMERS movie-related products because we're coming off of movie for the prior summer and the carryover for movie-related product was quite strong. Reassuringly, if you look at product line that's associated with our television series, Robots in Disguise, in the quarter, it was up quite significantly, double digits, but overall, the brand was down and that had an impact on our overall Franchise Brands growth rate. Despite or if you took that out, obviously, you'd see stronger growth underlyingly for our Franchise Brands, particularly incredibly strong growth for both NERF and PLAY-DOH."

And we see it is a great complement to the trilogy story that's being told. And as I said for the full year, we expect STAR WARS to be similarly sized. That's obviously really contributed to our Boys business as has NERF contributed to the Boys business and Super Soaker. I think the one headwind to think about for the remainder of the year certainly is JURASSIC WORLD that was down significantly and above the Boys action average for the second quarter. We still have about half the revenues. If you compare it in a movie year, Jurassic does about $100 million, so we have about half that to do -- to compare to 2015. And we've made the decision at the end of '17, we'll no longer handle Jurassic Park. We have many years of relationship with Universal, we'll no longer handle Jurassic Park because we're unable to arrive at a mutually beneficial financial arrangement on that brand. So again it's about $100 million in a movie year. It was a significant Q2 headwind, and it will be a bit of a headwind for Q3 and 4.

So we've not seen any negative impact on our business nor would we expect to. But we certainly believe in the mobile gaming genre. It's a wonderful way to contribute to storytelling as well as to get monetization of Games through a premium model. And our brands in the quarter performed at a very high level around mobile gaming, and we continue to like the category and we'll continue to build our business there. So we love that mobile gaming. It's something that people are focused on."

And obviously were down a bit versus Avengers a year ago. But again, a very strong contributor overall and off just a bit.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Through the execution of our brand blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across toy and games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products. Thes",1449,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Through the execution of our brand blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across toy and games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products. These efforts support our mission of creating the world's best play experiences and are delivering growth in our business. 
Second quarter revenues increased 10%, and operating profit grew 12%. Each major segment grew revenues and operating profit. All 4 product categories increased revenues. Consumer takeaway continued to grow, and we are making investments to enhance our talent and capabilities around the brand blueprint. 
Last week, we significantly enhanced our animation capabilities, with the acquisition of Boulder Media. Boulder is a leading animation studio based in Dublin, Ireland. This 150-person team is creating award-winning content for networks around the world. We are very excited to have Boulder join Hasbro as we build a world-class team in storytelling and content creation. The acquisition is not expected to have material impact on our 2016 financial results, but strategically, it reflects our mindset of investing in capabilities around the brand blueprint. 
Hasbro Franchise Brands increased 3% overall or 5% absent FX, with double-digit growth from both NERF and PLAY-DOH. Revenues from our Partners Brands increased 15%, led by STAR WARS and the addition of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN. These brands and future launches, including the introduction of FURBY CONNECT, DreamWorks' Trolls and products supporting the December release of Lucasfilm's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story position us well heading into the fall and holiday season. 
For the quarter, we grew across geographies, with 11% net revenue gains in both the U.S. and Canada segment and the International segment. Emerging market revenues increased 5% as reported and 13% absent FX. Europe grew 23% in the quarter, including a 25% or greater increase from the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Russia. 
While the U.K. Brexit vote has created some near-term uncertainty and negatively impacted its currency, we have positive momentum in both the U.K. and in Europe heading into the second half of the year. To date, we have not seen a negative impact on our business. 
Overall, global point of sale increased 6% in the quarter, with growth in the Boys, Girls and Games categories. For the first 6 months of the year, POS is up 17%. According to industry and Hasbro estimates, with data available through May, we continue to gain share in nearly every major market. In total, we increased our share by approximately 1.2 percentage points. Our portfolio is well positioned for the remainder of 2016 and future years. 
NERF and PLAY-DOH have continued to deliver strong growth. Several other Hasbro brands contributed to the gains, including BABY ALIVE, FurReal Friends and EASY BAKE as well as several Games brands, including PIE FACE, YAHTZEE and BOP-IT. 
MY LITTLE PONY declined slightly in the quarter as we transitioned elements of our toy line. Over the past 5 years, content and innovation has propelled this brand in both games and toys and consumer products. 
MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic Season 6 is currently airing around the world, and our fall product line features the core cast inspired by the locations they visit. MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS Mini Dolls have performed very well, exceeding our expectations and are helping offset difficult comparisons to a year ago. 
This leads us to next year when October 6, 2017, MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE will hit theaters with an all-star cast and global distribution from Lionsgate. The film introduces new characters, new worlds and new play experiences for the MY LITTLE PONY fan. 
TRANSFORMERS is also driving a significant business, supported by both television animation and theatrical films. The second season of Transformers: Robots in Disguise is airing on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and on networks around the world. TRANSFORMERS story is further being developed by an all-new digital streaming series and partnership with Machinima, kicking off in August and aligned to when our toys and consumer products become available. 
 
TRANSFORMERS revenue is down versus last year, but we have a rich content and product line for the year and clearly a strong entertainment calendar and immersive stories and characters moving forward. 
Transformers: The Last Knight is slated for release by Paramount on June 23, 2017, with 2 additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for 2018 and 2019. 
In addition, TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS, the first major Hasbro-branded game from Backflip Studios, was released on June 2. With over 3 million downloads in the first month, it quickly rose into the top 100 grossing games in the U.S. 
Through investment in our in-house capabilities and expansive industry-leading partnerships with the best gaming companies across platforms, Hasbro's digital gaming presence continues to grow. With millions of daily active users, consumer spending on Hasbro-branded mobile games increased over 80% in the first half of 2016 versus the first half of last year. 
One example of strong year-over-year growth is our YAHTZEE With Buddies social dice game from Scopely. 
Our face-to-face gaming business had a very good quarter behind several brands and play patterns. PIE FACE remains a top-selling game in many markets, and point of sale is extremely strong. PIE FACE SHOWDOWN, which brings the PIE FACE game play to a whole new level, will be at select retailers in August and will be widely available in Q4. 
In addition, as we delivered gaming for all platforms, PIE FACE is being developed as a stand-alone mobile game for play on Apple and Android devices and for living-room play on Apple TV. 
By responding quickly and bringing games to market in only a few months, we are capturing the excitement created by social media and our face-to-face gaming business. 
Hasbro's newest game, identified through our social listening expertise, is SPEAK OUT. Available this fall, the game captures the excitement around mouthpiece challenge videos. 
In addition, on July 22, MAGIC: THE GATHERING will launch Eldritch Moon, the second set within the Shadows over Innistrad. Shadows is off to a strong start as global prerelease event attendance matched our previous record, and our Launch Weekend event had the highest global participation ever. 
MAGIC revenues grew in the International segment in the second quarter, with strong metrics in all regions. However, planned set release timing shifted this year and created uneven comparisons versus the first half of last year. Despite the shift, we expect 2016 to be the eighth straight year of revenue growth for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Its popularity remains unmatched within the strategic trading card genre, and we are successfully expanding global engagement and advancing the game into new formats, including e-sports and digital. 
Within Partner Brands, STAR WARS and DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN represented the largest increases in the quarter. STAR WARS demand remains very strong. During the third quarter, we will begin shipping products in support of the December release of Rogue One. However, the third quarter last year marked the initial shipments for new STAR WARS products. 
DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN lines are selling very well, both in fashion dolls and the small doll line. We also have plans to launch 2 new properties this year: Elena of Avalor later this summer to support the new Disney Channel animated series and MOANA in the fourth quarter tied to the theatrical release. 
The transition to our DISNEY PRINCESS dolls product has been smooth overall, and we look forward to a second half of the year as retailers should have transitioned out of previous inventory. 
This year, we have several other great brands we are supporting, including YOKAI WATCH, which has been rolling out in markets globally, and the upcoming DreamWorks' release of Trolls. Our Trolls product will begin to hit retail in August ahead of the November 4 premier. 
We have tremendous partnerships with great IP owners. We approach each of these brands as if they were our own, committing to them the best talent, resources and innovative ideas in the industry. 
Looking ahead, we have positive momentum and a powerful line of brands and play experiences for the remainder of 2016 and clear line of sight to growth in future years. We have made tremendous progress in advancing our strategic capabilities to execute brands around the blueprint but continue to prioritize the further development of our skill set and our culture toward creating the world's best play experiences. 
Deb will speak in detail about our financial results, but we are very pleased with the strength of the first half of the year and remain focused on growing both revenues and profitability to enhance shareholder value over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"

The Hasbro team continue to drive strong results for the second quarter, including double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. We expanded our storytelling capabilities through our investment in Boulder Media, and our balance sheet remains strong. We've returned $179 million in cash to shareholders this year and remain committed to investing in our business, returning excess cash and maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
For the second quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 11%. The Boys, Girls and Games categories posted revenue growth, more than offsetting a decline in the Preschool category. 
Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues were flat. NERF, MONOPOLY and PLAY-DOH increases were primarily offset by a decline in TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues were up in the segment. U.S. point of sale increased in the high single digits for the quarter and more than 20% in the first half of the year. Retail inventory continued to be of very good quality. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 23% to $58 million or 13.6% of net revenues, reflecting higher sales only partially offset by higher expense levels as leverage improved in the quarter. 
International segment revenues grew 11%. Excluding the negative $17 million impact from foreign exchange, International segment revenues increased 15%. 
The Boys, Girls and Preschool categories posted growth in the quarter, while the Games category was down slightly. Franchise Brand revenues increased, with growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Partner Brand revenues also grew in the quarter. 
Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $29.7 million or 7.4% of net revenues. Similar to the U.S. and Canada segment, operating profit improved on higher revenues, which were only partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, currency has negatively impacted revenues by $46.3 million. Given the current global economic environment, we anticipate additional negative foreign exchange impact for the second half of the year. However, we now expect it will be slightly below the $100 million we initially projected for the full year. We continue to believe approximately 15% to 20% of that impact will also affect operating profit. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 9%, with gains in consumer product licensing and digital gaming revenues. Segment operating profit increased 86% to $13.8 million or 26.6% of revenues. Higher revenues, coupled with lower intangible amortization and lower program production amortization, drove the increase despite higher promotional expenses associated with digital gaming launches from Backflip Studios. 
Overall, operating profit increased 12%, and operating profit margin gained 20 basis points versus last year. The revenue increase from Entertainment and Licensing, Franchise Brands and Partner Brands delivered a favorable product mix, which drove cost of sales to revenue down 40 basis points versus last year. Royalties increased to 7.9% of revenues associated with continued strong growth in Partner Brands. 
In product development, we continue to invest at a higher level to drive innovative play and grow our brands. We also continue supporting our efforts with multifaceted advertising campaigns. 
Intangible amortization declined, reflecting some of our digital gaming assets becoming fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of last year. Program production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. We continue to invest in both television and film content, but this quarter, we're amortizing fewer television programs than last year at this time. 
SD&A increased 12% in the quarter primarily due to investments in brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, marketing and higher compensation expense. 
Through the first half of the year, operating profit margin has improved to 10% from 8.6% last year. This game is being driven by the strength of our brands, solid execution from our global teams and continuous strategic investment to drive growth over the long term. 
Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. Other income was $6.1 million versus $2.3 million last year and reflected increased investment gains. The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.1% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.41 compared to $0.33 last year. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash totaled $924 million at quarter end. We generated $585 million in cash over the past 12 months. 
During the second quarter, we returned $85.8 million to shareholders, $63.9 million in dividends and $21.9 million in share repurchases. Receivables at quarter end were down slightly, and DSOs decreased 8 days to 72 days. 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 3% versus a 12% revenue growth absent FX. The decline in DSOs was driven by the timing of revenue and collections in the quarter as well as the bad debt provision we took in the first quarter. 
Overall, our accounts receivable remain in good condition, and collections continue to be strong. Inventories increased 42% versus last year. Adjusting for negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 48%. 
Approximately 80% of the year-over-year increases is in brands which are new to our portfolio or delivering high growth, including DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, STAR WARS, NERF, PLAY-DOH and YOKAI WATCH. The quality of our inventory is high both at Hasbro and at retail as we're supporting new initiatives in addition to our planned growth. 
We entered the second half of the year in a very strong financial and market position. We have compelling brand initiatives and remain focused on delivering a very successful year. 
This strength of our business not only reflects the results of the investments we've made in our blueprint and teams but, more importantly, allows us to continue on our path of strategically investing in our brands and capabilities to further drive long-term profitable growth for Hasbro and our shareholders. 
Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

In most markets around the world, it's growing from mid- to high single digits. In a few markets, it's growing as high as double digits, including Spain, Italy, Russia and Mexico. Our business continues to grow around the world. We've gained market share in 10 of the 11 markets in -- that we measure and have measurement in the quarter and very strong market share gains. We're also obviously seeing overall revenues growth, above-market growth, strong double-digit growth for the company. And as we look out to the second half of the year, we have great momentum in our business, great POS momentum as well as momentum across both Franchise and Partner Brands. Our retailers have clearly made plans that involve many of our brands. In fact, if you look at just the quarter and look at the revenue contributors to the quarter, 7 of the top 10 revenue contributors in the quarter were Hasbro brands, and the remainder were our Partner Brands, so a great balanced portfolio of our owned and operated brands plus our Partner Brands. And both NERF and PLAY-DOH were the top 2 brands in terms of overall revenues. So you're clearly seeing a number of strengths in our product portfolio. They're in categories of business within the NPD categories that are also growing double digits, including action figures, dolls. Arts and crafts is down a bit, but our business is up and then outdoor sports and games.

And just as a reminder, from a hedging standpoint because I know people will be thinking about that as well, we hedged about 76%, 75%, 76% of our product costs last year. We've got about the same amount hedged this year as well. So as we kind of think about the impact of FX on -- specifically on costs, we are in about the same place. And with respect to Boulder, I mean, we're really excited to add the studio to a part of our business and create award-winning animation, and they'll continue to do that for third parties as we go forward. So revenue and expense associated with it will show up in our Entertainment and Licensing segment. And just a reminder, we did say it is a profitable studio, so we -- that's why we don't expect it to have a material impact on our results.

And we see it as a great complement to the trilogy story that's being told. And as I said, for the full year, we expect STAR WARS to be similarly sized. That's obviously really contributed to our Boys business as has NERF contributed to the Boys business and SUPER SOAKER. I think the one headwind to think about for the remainder of the year certainly is Jurassic World that was down significantly and above the Boys action average for the second quarter. We still have about half the revenues. If you compare it in a movie year, Jurassic does about $100 million, so we have about half that to do -- to compare to 2015. And we've made the decision at the end of '17, we'll no longer handle Jurassic Park. We've had many year relationship with Universal. We'll no longer handle Jurassic Park because we're unable to arrive at a mutually beneficial financial arrangement on that brand. So again, it's about $100 million in a movie year. It was a significant Q2 headwind, and it will be a bit of a headwind for Q3 and 4. So as you think about the full year and getting to your questions about how to think about gating around the Boys business and STAR WARS, I think that's a factor to consider."

It's a wonderful way to contribute to storytelling as well as to get monetization of games through a freemium model.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Through the execution of our brand blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across toy and games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products. Thes",1449,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Through the execution of our brand blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across toy and games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products. These efforts support our mission of creating the world's best play experiences and are delivering growth in our business. 
Second quarter revenues increased 10%, and operating profit grew 12%. Each major segment grew revenues and operating profit. All 4 product categories increased revenues. Consumer takeaway continued to grow, and we are making investments to enhance our talent and capabilities around the brand blueprint. 
Last week, we significantly enhanced our animation capabilities, with the acquisition of Boulder Media. Boulder is a leading animation studio based in Dublin, Ireland. This 150-person team is creating award-winning content for networks around the world. We are very excited to have Boulder join Hasbro as we build a world-class team in storytelling and content creation. The acquisition is not expected to have material impact on our 2016 financial results, but strategically, it reflects our mindset of investing in capabilities around the brand blueprint. 
Hasbro Franchise Brands increased 3% overall or 5% absent FX, with double-digit growth from both NERF and PLAY-DOH. Revenues from our Partners Brands increased 15%, led by STAR WARS and the addition of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN. These brands and future launches, including the introduction of FURBY CONNECT, DreamWorks' Trolls and products supporting the December release of Lucasfilm's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story position us well heading into the fall and holiday season. 
For the quarter, we grew across geographies, with 11% net revenue gains in both the U.S. and Canada segment and the International segment. Emerging market revenues increased 5% as reported and 13% absent FX. Europe grew 23% in the quarter, including a 25% or greater increase from the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Russia. 
While the U.K. Brexit vote has created some near-term uncertainty and negatively impacted its currency, we have positive momentum in both the U.K. and in Europe heading into the second half of the year. To date, we have not seen a negative impact on our business. 
Overall, global point of sale increased 6% in the quarter, with growth in the Boys, Girls and Games categories. For the first 6 months of the year, POS is up 17%. According to industry and Hasbro estimates, with data available through May, we continued to gain share in nearly every major market. In total, we increased our share by approximately 1.2 percentage points. Our portfolio is well positioned for the remainder of 2016 and future years. 
NERF and PLAY-DOH have continued to deliver strong growth. Several other Hasbro brands contributed to the gains, including BABY ALIVE, FurReal Friends and EASY BAKE as well as several Games brands, including PIE FACE, YAHTZEE and BOP-IT. 
MY LITTLE PONY declined slightly in the quarter as we transition elements of our toy line. Over the past 5 years, content and innovation has propelled this brand in both games and toys and consumer products. 
MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic Season 6 is currently airing around the world, and our fall product line features the core cast inspired by the locations they visit. MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS Mini Dolls have performed very well, exceeding our expectations and are helping offset difficult comparisons to a year ago. 
This leads us to next year when October 6, 2017, MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE will hit theaters with an all-star cast and global distribution from Lionsgate. The film introduces new characters, new worlds and new play experiences for the MY LITTLE PONY fan. 
TRANSFORMERS is also driving a significant business, supported by both television animation and theatrical films. The second season of Transformers: Robots in Disguise is airing on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and on networks around the world. TRANSFORMERS story is further being developed by an all-new digital streaming series in partnership with Machinima, kicking off in August and aligned to when our toys and consumer products become available. 
 
TRANSFORMERS revenue is down versus last year, but we have a rich content and product line for the year and clearly a strong entertainment calendar and immersive stories and characters moving forward. 
Transformers: The Last Knight is slated for release by Paramount on June 23, 2017, with 2 additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for 2018 and 2019. 
In addition, TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS, the first major Hasbro-branded game from Backflip Studios, was released on June 2. With over 3 million downloads in the first month, it quickly rose into the top 100 grossing games in the U.S. 
Through investment in our in-house capabilities and expansive industry-leading partnerships with the best gaming companies across platforms, Hasbro's digital gaming presence continues to grow. With millions of daily active users, consumer spending on Hasbro-branded mobile games increased over 80% in the first half of 2016 versus the first half of last year. 
One example of strong year-over-year growth is our YAHTZEE With Buddies social dice game from Scopely. 
Our face-to-face gaming business had a very good quarter behind several brands and play patterns. PIE FACE remains a top-selling game in many markets, and point of sale is extremely strong. PIE FACE SHOWDOWN, which brings the PIE FACE game play to a whole new level, will be at select retailers in August and will be widely available in Q4. 
In addition, as we deliver gaming for all platforms, PIE FACE is being developed as a stand-alone mobile game for play on Apple and Android devices and for living-room play on Apple TV. 
By responding quickly and bringing games to market in only a few months, we are capturing the excitement created by social media in our face-to-face gaming business. 
Hasbro's newest game, identified through our social listening expertise, is SPEAK OUT. Available this fall, the game captures the excitement around mouthpiece challenge videos. 
In addition, on July 22, MAGIC: THE GATHERING will launch Eldritch Moon, the second set within the Shadows over Innistrad. Shadows is off to a strong start as global prerelease event attendance matched our previous record, and our Launch Weekend event had the highest global participation ever. 
MAGIC revenues grew in the International segment in the second quarter, with strong metrics in all regions. However, planned set release timing shifted this year and created uneven comparisons versus the first half of last year. Despite the shift, we expect 2016 to be the eighth straight year of revenue growth for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Its popularity remains unmatched within the strategic trading card genre, and we are successfully expanding global engagement and advancing the game into new formats, including e-sports and digital. 
Within Partner Brands, STAR WARS and DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN represented the largest increases in the quarter. STAR WARS demand remains very strong. During the third quarter, we will begin shipping product in support of the December release of Rogue One. However, the third quarter last year marked the initial shipments for new STAR WARS products. 
DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN lines are selling very well, both in fashion dolls and the small doll line. We also have plans to launch 2 new properties this year: Elena of Avalor later this summer to support the new Disney Channel animated series and MOANA in the fourth quarter tied to the theatrical release. 
The transition to our DISNEY PRINCESS dolls product has been smooth overall, and we look forward to a second half of the year as retailers should have transitioned out of previous inventory. 
This year, we have several other great brands we are supporting, including YOKAI WATCH, which has been rolling out in markets globally, and the upcoming DreamWorks' release of Trolls. Our Trolls product will begin to hit retail in August ahead of the November 4 premiere. 
We have tremendous partnerships with great IP owners. We approach each of these brands as if they were our own, committing to them the best talent, resources and innovative ideas in the industry. 
Looking ahead, we have positive momentum and a powerful line of brands and play experiences for the remainder of 2016 and clear line of sight to growth in future years. We have made tremendous progress in advancing our strategic capabilities to execute brands around the blueprint but continue to prioritize the further development of our skill set and our culture toward creating the world's best play experiences. 
Deb will speak in detail about our financial results, but we are very pleased with the strength of the first half of the year and remain focused on growing both revenues and profitability to enhance shareholder value over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"

The Hasbro team continue to drive strong results for the second quarter, including double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. We expanded our storytelling capabilities through our investment in Boulder Media, and our balance sheet remains strong. We've returned $179 million in cash to shareholders this year and remain committed to investing in our business, returning excess cash and maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
For the second quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 11%. The Boys, Girls and Games categories posted revenue growth, more than offsetting a decline in the Preschool category. 
Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues were flat. NERF, MONOPOLY and PLAY-DOH increases were primarily offset by a decline in TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues were up in the segment. U.S. point of sale increased in the high single digits for the quarter and more than 20% in the first half of the year. Retail inventory continued to be of very good quality. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 23% to $58 million or 13.6% of net revenues, reflecting higher sales only partially offset by higher expense levels as leverage improved in the quarter. 
International segment revenues grew 11%. Excluding the negative $17 million impact from foreign exchange, International segment revenues increased 15%. 
The Boys, Girls and Preschool categories posted growth in the quarter, while the Games category was down slightly. Franchise Brand revenues increased, with growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Partner Brand revenues also grew in the quarter. 
Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $29.7 million or 7.4% of net revenues. Similar to the U.S. and Canada segment, operating profit improved on higher revenues, which were only partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, currency has negatively impacted revenues by $46.3 million. Given the current global economic environment, we anticipate additional negative foreign exchange impact for the second half of the year. However, we now expect it will be slightly below the $100 million we initially projected for the full year. We continue to believe approximately 15% to 20% of that impact will also affect operating profit. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 9%, with gains in consumer product licensing and digital gaming revenues. Segment operating profit increased 86% to $13.8 million or 26.6% of revenues. Higher revenues, coupled with lower intangible amortization and lower program production amortization, drove the increase despite higher promotional expenses associated with digital gaming launches from Backflip Studios. 
Overall, operating profit increased 12%, and operating profit margin gained 20 basis points versus last year. The revenue increase from Entertainment and Licensing, Franchise Brands and Partner Brands delivered a favorable product mix, which drove cost of sales to revenue down 40 basis points versus last year. Royalties increased to 7.9% of revenues associated with continued strong growth in Partner Brands. 
In product development, we continue to invest at a higher level to drive innovative play and grow our brands. We also continue supporting our efforts with multifaceted advertising campaigns. 
Intangible amortization declined, reflecting some of our digital gaming assets becoming fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of last year. Program production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. We continue to invest in both television and film content, but this quarter, we're amortizing fewer television programs than last year at this time. 
SD&A increased 12% in the quarter primarily due to investments in brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, marketing and higher compensation expense. 
Through the first half of the year, operating profit margin has improved to 10% from 8.6% last year. This gain is being driven by the strength of our brands, solid execution from our global teams and continuous strategic investment to drive growth over the long term. 
Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. Other income was $6.1 million versus $2.3 million last year and reflected increased investment gains. The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.1% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.41 compared to $0.33 last year. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash totaled $924 million at quarter end. We generated $585 million in cash over the past 12 months. 
During the second quarter, we returned $85.8 million to shareholders, $63.9 million in dividends and $21.9 million in share repurchases. Receivables at quarter end were down slightly, and DSOs decreased 8 days to 72 days. 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 3% versus a 12% revenue growth absent FX. The decline in DSOs was driven by the timing of revenue and collections in the quarter as well as the bad debt provision we took in the first quarter. 
Overall, our accounts receivable remain in good condition, and collections continue to be strong. Inventories increased 42% versus last year. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 48%. 
Approximately 80% of the year-over-year increases is in brands which are new to our portfolio or delivering high growth, including DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, STAR WARS, NERF, PLAY-DOH and YOKAI WATCH. The quality of our inventory is high both at Hasbro and at retail as we're supporting new initiatives in addition to our planned growth. 
We enter the second half of the year in a very strong financial and market position. We have compelling brand initiatives and remain focused on delivering a very successful year. 
This strength of our business not only reflects the results of the investments we've made in our blueprint and teams but, more importantly, allows us to continue on our path of strategically investing in our brands and capabilities to further drive long-term profitable growth for Hasbro and our shareholders. 
Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

And both NERF and PLAY-DOH were the top 2 brands in terms of overall revenues. So you're clearly seeing a number of strengths in our product portfolio. They're in categories of business within the NPD categories that are also growing double digits, including action figures, dolls. Arts and crafts is down a bit, but our business is up and then outdoor sports and games. So again, I'd say good visibility not only to the rest of the year, but as we go into '17 and '18, we have as good a visibility as we've ever had to multiyear plans for growth."

And just as a reminder, from a hedging standpoint because I know people will be thinking about that as well, we hedged about 76%, 75%, 76% of our product costs last year. We've got about the same amount hedged this year as well. So as we kind of think about the impact of FX on -- specifically on costs, we are in about the same place. And with respect to Boulder, I mean, we're really excited to add the studio to part of our business and create award-winning animation, and they'll continue to do that for third parties as we go forward. So revenue and expense associated with it will show up in our Entertainment and Licensing segment. And just a reminder, we did say it is a profitable studio, so we -- that's why we don't expect it to have a material impact on our results. But more importantly, with their good-quality animation capabilities, it really adds to our opportunity to continue to create world-class animation.

It's got a lot of great plastic play patterns in it. We're very excited about the product opportunities, and we'll have a robust line that's launching in late September. And we see it as a great complement to the trilogy story that's being told. And as I said, for the full year, we expect STAR WARS to be similarly sized. That's obviously really contributed to our Boys business as has NERF contributed to the Boys business and SUPER SOAKER. I think the one headwind to think about for the remainder of the year certainly is Jurassic World that was down significantly and above the Boys action average for the second quarter. We still have about half the revenues. If you compare it in a movie year, Jurassic does about $100 million, so we have about half that to do -- to compare to 2015. And we've made the decision at the end of '17, we'll no longer handle Jurassic Park. We've had many year relationship with Universal. We'll no longer handle Jurassic Park because we were unable to arrive at a mutually beneficial financial arrangement on that brand. So again, it's about $100 million in a movie year. It was a significant Q2 headwind, and it will be a bit of a headwind for Q3 and Q4. So as you think about the full year and getting to your questions about how to think about gating around the Boys business and STAR WARS, I think that's a factor to consider."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Through the execution of our brand blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across toy and games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products. Thes",1449,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Through the execution of our brand blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across toy and games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products. These efforts support our mission of creating the world's best play experiences and are delivering growth in our business. 
Second quarter revenues increased 10%, and operating profit grew 12%. Each major segment grew revenues and operating profit. All 4 product categories increased revenues. Consumer takeaway continued to grow, and we are making investments to enhance our talent and capabilities around the brand blueprint. 
Last week, we significantly enhanced our animation capabilities, with the acquisition of Boulder Media. Boulder is a leading animation studio based in Dublin, Ireland. This 150-person team is creating award-winning content for networks around the world. We are very excited to have Boulder join Hasbro as we build a world-class team in storytelling and content creation. The acquisition is not expected to have material impact on our 2016 financial results, but strategically, it reflects our mindset of investing in capabilities around the brand blueprint. 
Hasbro Franchise Brands increased 3% overall or 5% absent FX, with double-digit growth from both NERF and PLAY-DOH. Revenues from our Partners Brands increased 15%, led by STAR WARS and the addition of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN. These brands and future launches, including the introduction of FURBY CONNECT, DreamWorks' Trolls and products supporting the December release of Lucasfilm's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story position us well heading into the fall and holiday season. 
For the quarter, we grew across geographies, with 11% net revenue gains in both the U.S. and Canada segment and the International segment. Emerging market revenues increased 5% as reported and 13% absent FX. Europe grew 23% in the quarter, including a 25% or greater increase from the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Russia. 
While the U.K. Brexit vote has created some near-term uncertainty and negatively impacted its currency, we have positive momentum in both the U.K. and in Europe heading into the second half of the year. To date, we have not seen a negative impact on our business. 
Overall, global point of sale increased 6% in the quarter, with growth in the Boys, Girls and Games categories. For the first 6 months of the year, POS is up 17%. According to industry and Hasbro estimates, with data available through May, we continued to gain share in nearly every major market. In total, we increased our share by approximately 1.2 percentage points. Our portfolio is well positioned for the remainder of 2016 and future years. 
NERF and PLAY-DOH have continued to deliver strong growth. Several other Hasbro brands contributed to the gains, including BABY ALIVE, FurReal Friends and EASY BAKE as well as several Games brands, including PIE FACE, YAHTZEE and BOP-IT. 
MY LITTLE PONY declined slightly in the quarter as we transition elements of our toy line. Over the past 5 years, content and innovation has propelled this brand in both games and toys and consumer products. 
MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic Season 6 is currently airing around the world, and our fall product line features the core cast inspired by the locations they visit. MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS Mini Dolls have performed very well, exceeding our expectations and are helping offset difficult comparisons to a year ago. 
This leads us to next year when October 6, 2017, MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE will hit theaters with an all-star cast and global distribution from Lionsgate. The film introduces new characters, new worlds and new play experiences for the MY LITTLE PONY fan. 
TRANSFORMERS is also driving a significant business, supported by both television animation and theatrical films. The second season of Transformers: Robots in Disguise is airing on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and on networks around the world. TRANSFORMERS story is further being developed by an all-new digital streaming series in partnership with Machinima, kicking off in August and aligned to when our toys and consumer products become available. 
 
TRANSFORMERS revenue is down versus last year, but we have a rich content and product line for the year and clearly a strong entertainment calendar and immersive stories and characters moving forward. 
Transformers: The Last Knight is slated for release by Paramount on June 23, 2017, with 2 additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for 2018 and 2019. 
In addition, TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS, the first major Hasbro-branded game from Backflip Studios, was released on June 2. With over 3 million downloads in the first month, it quickly rose into the top 100 grossing games in the U.S. 
Through investment in our in-house capabilities and expansive industry-leading partnerships with the best gaming companies across platforms, Hasbro's digital gaming presence continues to grow. With millions of daily active users, consumer spending on Hasbro-branded mobile games increased over 80% in the first half of 2016 versus the first half of last year. 
One example of strong year-over-year growth is our YAHTZEE With Buddies social dice game from Scopely. 
Our face-to-face gaming business had a very good quarter behind several brands and play patterns. PIE FACE remains a top-selling game in many markets, and point of sale is extremely strong. PIE FACE SHOWDOWN, which brings the PIE FACE game play to a whole new level, will be at select retailers in August and will be widely available in Q4. 
In addition, as we deliver gaming for all platforms, PIE FACE is being developed as a stand-alone mobile game for play on Apple and Android devices and for living-room play on Apple TV. 
By responding quickly and bringing games to market in only a few months, we are capturing the excitement created by social media in our face-to-face gaming business. 
Hasbro's newest game, identified through our social listening expertise, is SPEAK OUT. Available this fall, the game captures the excitement around mouthpiece challenge videos. 
In addition, on July 22, MAGIC: THE GATHERING will launch Eldritch Moon, the second set within the Shadows over Innistrad. Shadows is off to a strong start as global prerelease event attendance matched our previous record, and our Launch Weekend event had the highest global participation ever. 
MAGIC revenues grew in the International segment in the second quarter, with strong metrics in all regions. However, planned set release timing shifted this year and created uneven comparisons versus the first half of last year. Despite the shift, we expect 2016 to be the eighth straight year of revenue growth for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Its popularity remains unmatched within the strategic trading card genre, and we are successfully expanding global engagement and advancing the game into new formats, including e-sports and digital. 
Within Partner Brands, STAR WARS and DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN represented the largest increases in the quarter. STAR WARS demand remains very strong. During the third quarter, we will begin shipping product in support of the December release of Rogue One. However, the third quarter last year marked the initial shipments for new STAR WARS products. 
DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN lines are selling very well, both in fashion dolls and the small doll line. We also have plans to launch 2 new properties this year: Elena of Avalor later this summer to support the new Disney Channel animated series and MOANA in the fourth quarter tied to the theatrical release. 
The transition to our DISNEY PRINCESS dolls product has been smooth overall, and we look forward to a second half of the year as retailers should have transitioned out of previous inventory. 
This year, we have several other great brands we are supporting, including YOKAI WATCH, which has been rolling out in markets globally, and the upcoming DreamWorks' release of Trolls. Our Trolls product will begin to hit retail in August ahead of the November 4 premiere. 
We have tremendous partnerships with great IP owners. We approach each of these brands as if they were our own, committing to them the best talent, resources and innovative ideas in the industry. 
Looking ahead, we have positive momentum and a powerful line of brands and play experiences for the remainder of 2016 and clear line of sight to growth in future years. We have made tremendous progress in advancing our strategic capabilities to execute brands around the blueprint but continue to prioritize the further development of our skill set and our culture toward creating the world's best play experiences. 
Deb will speak in detail about our financial results, but we are very pleased with the strength of the first half of the year and remain focused on growing both revenues and profitability to enhance shareholder value over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"

The Hasbro team continue to drive strong results for the second quarter, including double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. We expanded our storytelling capabilities through our investment in Boulder Media, and our balance sheet remains strong. We've returned $179 million in cash to shareholders this year and remain committed to investing in our business, returning excess cash and maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
For the second quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 11%. The Boys, Girls and Games categories posted revenue growth, more than offsetting a decline in the Preschool category. 
Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues were flat. NERF, MONOPOLY and PLAY-DOH increases were primarily offset by a decline in TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues were up in the segment. U.S. point of sale increased in the high single digits for the quarter and more than 20% in the first half of the year. Retail inventory continued to be of very good quality. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 23% to $58 million or 13.6% of net revenues, reflecting higher sales only partially offset by higher expense levels as leverage improved in the quarter. 
International segment revenues grew 11%. Excluding the negative $17 million impact from foreign exchange, International segment revenues increased 15%. 
The Boys, Girls and Preschool categories posted growth in the quarter, while the Games category was down slightly. Franchise Brand revenues increased, with growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Partner Brand revenues also grew in the quarter. 
Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $29.7 million or 7.4% of net revenues. Similar to the U.S. and Canada segment, operating profit improved on higher revenues, which were only partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, currency has negatively impacted revenues by $46.3 million. Given the current global economic environment, we anticipate additional negative foreign exchange impact for the second half of the year. However, we now expect it will be slightly below the $100 million we initially projected for the full year. We continue to believe approximately 15% to 20% of that impact will also affect operating profit. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 9%, with gains in consumer product licensing and digital gaming revenues. Segment operating profit increased 86% to $13.8 million or 26.6% of revenues. Higher revenues, coupled with lower intangible amortization and lower program production amortization, drove the increase despite higher promotional expenses associated with digital gaming launches from Backflip Studios. 
Overall, operating profit increased 12%, and operating profit margin gained 20 basis points versus last year. The revenue increase from Entertainment and Licensing, Franchise Brands and Partner Brands delivered a favorable product mix, which drove cost of sales to revenue down 40 basis points versus last year. Royalties increased to 7.9% of revenues associated with continued strong growth in Partner Brands. 
In product development, we continue to invest at a higher level to drive innovative play and grow our brands. We also continue supporting our efforts with multifaceted advertising campaigns. 
Intangible amortization declined, reflecting some of our digital gaming assets becoming fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of last year. Program production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. We continue to invest in both television and film content, but this quarter, we're amortizing fewer television programs than last year at this time. 
SD&A increased 12% in the quarter primarily due to investments in brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, marketing and higher compensation expense. 
Through the first half of the year, operating profit margin has improved to 10% from 8.6% last year. This gain is being driven by the strength of our brands, solid execution from our global teams and continuous strategic investment to drive growth over the long term. 
Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. Other income was $6.1 million versus $2.3 million last year and reflected increased investment gains. The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.1% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.41 compared to $0.33 last year. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash totaled $924 million at quarter end. We generated $585 million in cash over the past 12 months. 
During the second quarter, we returned $85.8 million to shareholders, $63.9 million in dividends and $21.9 million in share repurchases. Receivables at quarter end were down slightly, and DSOs decreased 8 days to 72 days. 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 3% versus a 12% revenue growth absent FX. The decline in DSOs was driven by the timing of revenue and collections in the quarter as well as the bad debt provision we took in the first quarter. 
Overall, our accounts receivable remain in good condition, and collections continue to be strong. Inventories increased 42% versus last year. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 48%. 
Approximately 80% of the year-over-year increases is in brands which are new to our portfolio or delivering high growth, including DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, STAR WARS, NERF, PLAY-DOH and YOKAI WATCH. The quality of our inventory is high both at Hasbro and at retail as we're supporting new initiatives in addition to our planned growth. 
We enter the second half of the year in a very strong financial and market position. We have compelling brand initiatives and remain focused on delivering a very successful year. 
This strength of our business not only reflects the results of the investments we've made in our blueprint and teams but, more importantly, allows us to continue on our path of strategically investing in our brands and capabilities to further drive long-term profitable growth for Hasbro and our shareholders.

We're also obviously seeing overall revenues growth above market growth, strong double-digit growth for the company. And as we look out to the second half of the year, we have great momentum in our business, great POS momentum as well as momentum across both Franchise and Partner Brands. Our retailers have clearly made plans that involve many of our brands. In fact, if you look at just the quarter and look at the revenue contributors to the quarter, 7 of the top 10 revenue contributors in the quarter were Hasbro brands, and the remainder were our Partner Brands, so a great balanced portfolio of our owned and operated brands plus our Partner Brands. And both NERF and PLAY-DOH were the top 2 brands in terms of overall revenues. So you're clearly seeing a number of strengths in our product portfolio. They're in categories of business within the NPD categories that are also growing double digits, including action figures, dolls. Arts and crafts is down a bit, but our business is up and then outdoor sports and games. So again, I'd say good visibility not only to the rest of the year, but as we go into '17 and '18, we have as good a visibility as we've ever had to multiyear plans for growth."

And just as a reminder, from a hedging standpoint because I know people will be thinking about that as well, we hedged about 76%, 75%, 76% of our product costs last year. We've got about the same amount hedged this year as well. So as we kind of think about the impact of FX on -- specifically on costs, we are in about the same place. And with respect to Boulder, I mean, we're really excited to add the studio to part of our business and create award-winning animation, and they'll continue to do that for third parties as we go forward. So revenue and expense associated with it will show up in our Entertainment and Licensing segment. And just a reminder, we did say it is a profitable studio, so we -- that's why we don't expect it to have a material impact on our results.

I think the one headwind to think about for the remainder of the year certainly is Jurassic World that was down significantly and above the Boys action average for the second quarter. We still have about half the revenues. If you compare it in a movie year, Jurassic does about $100 million, so we have about half that to do -- to compare to 2015. And we've made the decision at the end of '17, we'll no longer handle Jurassic Park. We've had many year relationship with Universal. We'll no longer handle Jurassic Park because we were unable to arrive at a mutually beneficial financial arrangement on that brand. So again, it's about $100 million in a movie year. It was a significant Q2 headwind, and it will be a bit of a headwind for Q3 and Q4. So as you think about the full year and getting to your questions about how to think about gating around the Boys business and STAR WARS, I think that's a factor to consider."

Obviously, Captain America and some of the Marvel Legends product were great contributors and obviously were down a bit versus Avengers in the year ago. But again, a very strong contributor overall and off just a bit. As I said, the biggest impact to the Boys category in the quarter as a headwind was Jurassic."

The Hasbro team delivered a tremendous third quarter, the highest revenue and earnings quarter in Hasbro's history. Revenues grew 14% behind innovative products and engaging storytelling, increasing across all major operating segments and geographies. 
Operating profit increased faster than revenues, up 19%, and we continued investing to profitably grow for years to come. Our financial position is strong, and we returned $112 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. 
As we develop Hasbro into a global play and entertainment company, we have built robust brand building capabilities, including storytelling that supports an expensive brand portfolio. 
Today, we're garnering a greater share of life than ever before by reaching broader demographics, play experiences and geographies. Our innovation marketing and investments are informed by the global consumer insights we are uncovering as we engage with consumers and audiences across touch points and mediums. The investments we have made in our digital expertise enable our global teams to develop immersive brand experiences, which, in turn, elevate our connection with consumers and fans. 
This has far-reaching implications in how we develop brands, engage with consumers, tell stories and spend our marketing dollars. Our digital expertise is differentiating our brands. Thus far, in 2016, videos Hasbro curated or created, along with user-generated content, garnered nearly 5 billion views. 
Third quarter revenues grew at a double-digit pace in both the U.S. and Canada and International segments. Developed economies, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., France and Italy each grew revenues double digits. Emerging markets increased 16%, with strong growth in Latin America, including Brazil, as well as in Asia, including China. The industry also continue to grow, up 6% through August according to industry and company estimates. And Hasbro is gaining share. Importantly, we gained share in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia as well as developed economies, including the U.S., U.K., Spain, Italy and Australia. 
Global point of sale increased slightly in the quarter, overcoming difficult entertainment comparisons at retail, including a later set date for STAR WARS this year and post movie declines for JURASSIC WORLD. 
Girls and Games POS increased, while Boys and Preschool declined. We are seeing strong POS as we start the fourth quarter. 
In respect to Hasbro's third quarter revenues, Hasbro Franchise Brands increased 2%. This growth was led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF, TRANSFORMERS and PLAY-DOH. NERF grew for the 15th consecutive quarter, while PLAY-DOH extended its growth streak to 20 straight quarters. In addition, TRANSFORMERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues increased. 
Transformers: Robots in Disguise animation as well as streaming content from Machinima is supporting product lines, which have strong initial consumer reaction. Importantly, TRANSFORMERS has good momentum heading into 2017, which marks the first of 3 years with planned major theatrical entertainment. 
We have momentum in our gaming portfolio, with growth in several brands driving the 13% increase in the category. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUEL MASTERS, PIE FACE, SIMON and BOP-IT were among the brands posting positive gains. 
Despite most of MAGIC's revenue not being included in our POS reports, POS for the Games category grew. Hasbro's gaming portfolio is unmatched, and we are cultivating gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms, including face-to-face gaming, off-the-board gaming and digital gaming experiences, notably in mobile. 
One of our newest Games, SPEAK OUT, has generated more than 100 million online views. Consumer takeaway has been extremely strong, and we are working to catch up to demand. 
Within our mobile gaming portfolio, Backflip Studios is scheduled to unveil an all new mobile game, DragonVale World, during the fourth quarter. This marks the first major release for this gaming property since Hasbro took a 70% stake in the studio. 
Backflip has also unveiled several new mobile games this year based on Hasbro brands, including TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS and just last week, MY LITTLE PONY Puzzle Party. 
The MY LITTLE PONY franchise continue to drive brand awareness through the strategic use of entertainment, pop culture events and consumer products expansion. In a very competitive small ball segment, our holiday items and new launches are beginning to drive POS gains in many markets around the world. In 2017, the MY LITTLE PONY movie will bring global audiences to all new whirls with both the core cast of characters, along with all new characters. 
In addition to our Franchise Brand and gaming portfolio, innovative new offerings at a variety of price points delivered growth for Baby Alive, FURBY and FurReal Friends. 
Within our Partner Brands portfolio, revenues increased 19%, driven by positive contributions from Hasbro's shipments of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and YO-KAI WATCH. For the full year, we now expect Partner Brand revenues to approach 30% of total Hasbro revenue. Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN is off to a strong start behind a favorable reception to our core shimmer fashion doll assortment. 
Overall, the brands are ahead of our plans for the year, and we recently expanded our offering with new holiday items as well as new items in support of entertainment for Elena of Avalor and Moana. 
STAR WARS continues to be a top global property with strong consumer and retail support around the world. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story product was on-shelf September 30, which was several weeks later than last year's on-shelf date of September 4. This shift most notably impacted our U.S. POS results. Our expectation remains that our 2016 STAR WARS revenue may match the level we achieved in 2015. 
In addition, YO-KAI WATCH and DREAMWORKS' TROLLS contributed to our Partner Brand portfolio gains this quarter. YO-KAI WATCH is now available in global markets, including strong initial performances in several countries. Our DREAMWORKS' TROLLS line hits shelves in the third quarter. Working closely with DreamWorks throughout the development of the movie, we have a robust offering of dolls, flash games and more in support of the global movie premieres over the next several weeks. 
In closing, we've made great strides throughout 2016, including the third quarter, which historically is the largest revenue quarter of our year. Hasbro and our retailers are well positioned to deliver on what we expect to be a strong holiday season for Hasbro brands. Our initiatives are resonating with consumers, and we have good retailers support. 
In addition, inventory available at retail and at Hasbro is improved from this time last year. We are very well positioned heading into 2017 when the entertainment lineup from Hasbro and our partners is among the best we have ever experienced. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,318900558,1055758,"Hasbro Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter result highlighted the strength of Hasbro's business across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top",1340,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter result highlighted the strength of Hasbro's business across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top and bottom line, and we're set for a strong finish to the year. 
14% quarterly revenue growth drove a 19% increase in quarterly operating profit. We grew margins, while investing in our business, in innovation across our brand portfolio, in storytelling across mediums, in our consumer product global talent and in digital expertise, including projects for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and new gaming launches at Backflip Studios. 
Over the trailing 12-month period, we generated $637 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with $830 million in cash on our balance sheet. 
As we look to the full year, we have good momentum in our brands, including our new line supporting DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN. 
In addition, we're supporting more motion pictures in the fourth quarter than last year. We have the right inventory and the right places, both at retail and in our warehouses to support this momentum. 
For the third quarter 2016, we grew revenues in each major operating segment. In the U.S. and Canada segment, revenues increased 16%. Revenue growth in the Games and Girls categories more than offset declines in the Boys and Preschool categories. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues grew 2%, with growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF and TRANSFORMERS. 
Partner Brand revenues increased 13% in the segment, behind contributions from Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and to a lesser extent, YO-KAI WATCH. 
Additional Hasbro brands, including Baby Alive, EASY BAKE, PIE FACE and FURBY also contributed to the year-over-year growth for the segment. 
U.S. point of sale declined slightly in the quarter, given difficult comparisons to JURASSIC WORLD and a shift in timing for STAR WARS on shelf dates versus last year. POS increased in the mid-teens for the first 3 quarters and is positive to start the fourth quarter. 
Retail inventory continue to be a very good quality and has grown primarily from the addition of new initiative. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 22% to $228 million or 24.4% of net revenues. Similar to prior quarters this year, higher revenues drove improved expense leverage. 
International segment revenues grew 13%, including a negative $3 million impact from foreign exchange. Within the International segment, the Boys, Girls and Preschool categories grew, while the Games category was flat. 
Franchise Brand revenues increased 4% with growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, NERF and TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues increased 30% behind Hasbro shipments of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, YO-KAI WATCH and DREAMWORKS' TROLLS. Hasbro brands Baby Alive and PIE FACE also contributed to the segment's strong performance. Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $133.1 million or 19.3% of net revenues. 
The International segment continued to generate greater expense leverage. Through the first 9 months of the year, currency is negatively impacted revenues by $49.1 million. Based on current economic trends, we anticipate a potential further impact of up to approximately $25 million for the remainder of the year. Despite an improved currency translation outlook from where we began the year, the impact from currency varies by market, and our global teams continue to manage the ongoing economic impact on retailers and consumers from currency devaluations in several markets around the world. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 8% behind revenue growth in consumer product Licensing and Digital Gaming. Segment operating profit decreased $2.2 million or 13% to $14.1 million or 25.1% of net revenues. 
Higher revenues and lower program production amortization were partially offset by investments in building our consumer products team globally and higher expenses at Backflip Studios in support of new gaming launches. Boulder Media revenue and expenses are being recorded in the segment and were not material in the quarter. 
Overall, operating profit increased 19%, and operating profit margin gained 100 basis points versus last year. Double-digit revenue growth drove improved expense leverage for the quarter as well as year-to-date. For the full year, we anticipate operating margin in line with or up slightly from last year. 
Cost of sales in the third quarter declined slightly as a percentage of sales and continue to benefit from growth in Partner Brands. This growth in Partner Brand revenue also led to an increase in royalties, which, at 8% of revenues, is up 30 basis points year-over-year. We now expect royalties for the full year to be in the range of our year-to-date level of 8.1% of revenues and last year's level of 8.5%. 
Program production cost amortization declined in the quarter and is running lower in 2016 than last year as we have delivered in our amortizing fewer television programs. 
Content development and storytelling remained core to our strategic investments, and we've spent $36 million in cash on television and film production over the first 9 months of the year. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we acquired Boulder Media to enhance our animation and storytelling expertise. 
SD&A as a percentage of sales is up slightly versus last year. The increase reflected higher spending on digital programs, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Backflip. Compensation expense increased during the quarter, and we anticipate will increase further in the fourth quarter as we true-up 2 years of successful performance on long-term plans versus measures we set several years ago. 
Turning to our results below operating profit. Other income was $8.5 million versus $5.1 million last year. The improvement resulted from a small foreign currency translation gain this year versus a loss last year and, to a lesser extent, higher interest income and growth in earnings from our share of the Discovery Family Channel. 
On a reported basis, the third quarter of 2015 included a $6.8 million gain from the sale of 2 manufacturing facilities. 
Absent the gain, other expense was $1.7 million last year. 
The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.2% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. Diluted earnings per share was $2.03 compared to EPS of $1.64 last year. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Strong cash generation enabled us not only to invest in growing Hasbro, but also to return cash to our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $112.4 million to shareholders, $64 million in dividends and $48.4 million in share repurchases. We've spent $106 million in share repurchases through the first 3 quarters of 2016. This is in line with our full year target of repurchasing $100 million to $150 million, which, as always, is subject to market conditions. 
Receivables at quarter end increased 5% versus the 14% revenue growth, and DSOs decreased 7 days to 78 days. Our accounts receivable remain in good condition and collections continue to be strong. 
Inventories increased 36% versus last year. The overall quality of this inventory is good, and our inventory availability has improved from this point last year. More than $100 million of the year-over-year increase is in DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, YO-KAI WATCH and Trolls, which are all new lines for Hasbro. And for PIE FACE, which is a much bigger business this year than last. 
We're also supporting multiple films in the fourth quarter, including Rogue One. The later on-shelf date and our better inventory availability for this line resulted in Hasbro having more inventory on our books at quarter-end than last year. At year-end, we believe we will have the appropriate inventory to support our lines as well as new initiatives occurring early in 2017, including DISNEY'S live-action, Beauty and the Beast film. 
Finally, our retail inventories have grown in support of the successful new initiatives in growing Hasbro brands. 
In closing, we have the right brand, the right assets and the right teams to deliver a successful year. And we remain committed to taking the right strategic steps to position Hasbro for 2017 and beyond.

So about half of the increase in our inventory is in -- it sits in our International segments, where, believe it or not, at the end of the quarter, we had positive -- we had an increase because of FX, just the way the rates landed at the end of the quarter versus throughout the whole period. So the remainder of the inventory, we -- the $100 million of increase really was due to new lines. The additional piece is due to being in a better position for some of the things that are doing very well this year, like NERF and PLAY-DOH. In addition, we have STAR WARS inventory, which was for Rogue One watch happened at September 30, which was a first Friday, was September 4 a year ago. So overall, this just contributed to having a bit more inventory and place at the end of the quarter, but at a lower percentage increase. And I think what we saw at the end of the second quarter, and as we look to year end, we will be in a good position. We do expect inventory to be up, but not by as much at the end of the year as we have some great new launches coming in the first quarter of 2017, including DISNEY'S live-action Beauty and the Beast, which happens early in the quarter. So we do expect to see inventory up, but at a lower rate."

Or is there a shortfall in one of your Franchise Brands? That's my first question. Second question is on POS. I think you mentioned that it was up modestly in the third quarter, but you were seeing an uptick at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Are you suggesting that you're seeing an acceleration?

We are, in fact, seeing really strong POS trends entering the fourth quarter, particularly in the U.S. We saw a little bit of softness in POS in the late summer, July, August period. And then in September, given the shift in STAR WARS as well as the impact from Jurassic, that impacted our U.S. POS. Internationally, we're seeing very strong POS up double digits in Europe, up in Latin America, up year-to-date in Asia Pacific. And then in the quarter in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, recently, we've seen some retail issues with a retailer where there was just less inventory taken and a little bit less of a sell-through and therefore impacted that half of number, the Asia Pacific number because of Australia. So overall, we feel very good about the POS trends year-to-date and the POS trends going into fourth quarter with a little bit of a note in the third quarter due to some of those timing shifts and some of the brands that have come down significantly versus a year ago. As we think about DISNEY PRINCESS, it's performing incredibly strongly, and it's ahead of our original plan for the year. Our global teams, in partnership with DISNEY, are doing an excellent job. And in fact, we're seeing great growth from areas like our Royal Shimmer fashion dolls, that's the all 11 princesses, not even including Anna and Elsa. For the holidays, we have a big presence coming for the Royal Dreams fashion doll, Castle, so we even give Girls great places to play with their dolls. Deb mentioned some of the entertainment. But also note that in 2017 in the first quarter, we'll have the broadcast premiere of FROZEN. We'll have a holiday special next year from FROZEN. We also have Elena of Avalor, which is off to a very strong start as a television initiative. And then we're also very excited about the launch of MOANA. So all of those elements leading to a very strong Princess business. And we've made great strides and making great progress there toward our long-term objective of growing that business far beyond where it had been in the past."

In fact, the Girls business would have been up in the third quarter absent PRINCESS and FROZEN. So our Boys business because of NERF, where NERF business is up significantly, TRANSFORMERS business in the quarter was up. We're really seeing how the addition of fan-oriented content that started this season on Machinima combined with our core Boys entertainment, combined with our Preschool Boys entertainment is really driving that brand. And we're going to take it to the next level and set it up really well for 2017 when we go into a first year of 3 anticipated movies over the next 3 years.

Last year, which was in our third quarter and this year, it's our week 40, which is in our fourth quarter. So as Deb noted, it means that the inventory for that initiative was on our books at the end of the third quarter. It wasn't yet really out at retail significantly it was a year ago. So therefore, you didn't have that the rate of sell-through on POS. And so you saw that reflected in our third quarter POS, particularly in the U.S. business. Internationally, you didn't see quite the same impact. So overall, I would say a couple of things. First, STAR WARS year-to-date sales, revenues, are up significantly through the third quarter. So as we look at the full year, we look at International POS. And the POS we're seeing coming into the fourth quarter, now that we have inventory, we, again, reiterate our belief that 2015 levels could equal 2016 levels for the STAR WARS brand."

Obviously, you've seen some of the trailers, and you could imagine all the character play and vehicle play that will come and role play that will come as a result of the movie. And as we've said, we look at the business year-on-year versus quarter for quarter, and that's been consistent throughout the year. So we're incredibly excited about this movie.

Our percent in stocks have improved year-on-year, that's something that we care about. We want to make our shelf spaces productive as possible in partnership with our retailers.

If you look at the mix, it's a bit more mix toward lower-priced products and that has to do with the fact that there's some lower price SKUs from prior product inventory that are still selling through in the third quarter. So overall, we're seeing growth in our business, and we're seeing like-for-like stronger take away for our products, but we're also seeing stronger take away into the third quarter for lower-priced products that will be eliminated over the next quarter or 2. We're seeing great takeaway in fashion dolls offering all 11 fashion dolls. We're seeing great early take away from Elena of Avalor. So again, overall PRINCESS and FROZEN performing well. And FROZEN, what's great is the brand is performing for us at quite strong level and FROZEN has even more of an International footprint than the PRINCESS business on a percentage basis so more countries around the world are really focusing in on FROZEN with great results globally and you see that indicated in some of our pos data as FROZEN tending to be slightly more internationally oriented on percentage terms. Obviously, we're benefiting from a great campaign that's began this fall called Dream Big PRINCESS in partnership with the DISNEY company and of course, we're very much looking forward to all of the new entertainment coming next year, the broadcast debut of FROZEN, the FROZEN holiday special.

So if you look at Boys business in the quarter, the biggest decline both for Boys and for our company in the quarter was Jurassic, that's the impact that it had. In the quarter, MARVEL is up a bit in the Boys business. Our action figure business is performing quite a high level. We had -- it was a strong contributor of the quarter. We had great partnership on Superhero Spectacular Retail program with DISNEY and with MARVEL. Our MARVEL Legends business is performing quite well, Spider-Man is also performing quite strongly, which is a great lead into next year's movie. So that's what we're seeing. We're also have got a lot of fan-oriented product. It's one of the brands that's responding the most to our fan orientation and fanning the flames of our fans and providing product to them that they really like and offering that online, and you'll see some products for fans around Dr. Strange. As you go forward, NERF is growing dramatically for both quarter as well as year-to-date. STAR WARS, as I said, year-to-date is up significantly down in the quarter and TRANSFORMERS is up as I noted, TRANSFORMERS is up pretty substantial in the quarter. It has to do with the fact that we continue to improve the blueprint and add elements to the blueprint this quarter with the Machinima content running, the combined awards and that product performing at quite a strong level. So TRANSFORMERS business is doing well. We also add to that Backflip Studios, TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS, which is all around combining wars. So again, executing that blueprint. We even had fan-created product in the quarter, which is a campaign called Victorian. Created by fans who are allowing fans to curate, along with the content that we're streaming. So 3 types of contents. That's a strong lead in to our 2017 plans for TRANSFORMERS. In addition, I forgot to mention but in MARVEL, we have very strong plans leading to next year in 2017, obviously, with Guardians of the Galaxy, with the Spider-Man movie and a Thor movie. So we're in a good position on the MARVEL Boys business overall. And then of course, our new initiative that's working particularly well in early days internationally is YO-KAI WATCH. We you started launch in International markets, and we're seeing some great takeaway there. So overall, there's kind of our Boys line up. And as I've said on STAR WARS, to repeat, we do expect that STAR WARS could equal STAR WARS levels of 2015 across the company."

You're going to see, in 2017, 2 Hasbro films so certainly TRANSFORMERS, you're also going to see a MY LITTLE PONY animated feature in the fall. The opportunity in TRANSFORMERS is to take the storytelling into movies for multiple years, and you'll see that in '17, '18 and '19 with different kinds of stories being told. So not every movie will be the same, but every movie continues to add to the character and story of the property. And when we first started, our objective was always to build the brand enterprise value through the blueprint. And so this is the next logical step. I took a step back as we came into the third quarter call just to give a perspective on our Franchise Brands and brands like TRANSFORMERS. So I look at Franchise Brands as we were sitting here at the end of the third quarter 2013 and take it today, year-to-date versus year-to-date, '13 versus '16, our Franchise Brands are up 33%. And that's the view we take to our businesses is that longer view of building brands over time, adding elements to our blueprint, adding capabilities and taking our brands overtime to the next level. So that's indicative of the way that we think about Franchise Brands. So TRANSFORMERS steps ups, MY LITTLE PONY steps up for next year and then in the next couple of years, you'll also see LITTLEST PET SHOP stepping up to more content in a number of ways."

I think over time, what we've seen is that entertainment is stretching the retail calendar both online and at brick-and-mortar globally with more entertainment initiatives occurring, but spreading the calendar to be now from the first quarter through the fourth quarter versus the older thinking of just looking at summer movies, and that's quite good for our business and good for the way we think about executing our blueprint. In the first quarter, you don't have new initiatives coming from DISNEY and Beauty and the Beast live action, there's a Wolverine movie coming that helps to continue to support the X-Men business. And then Guardians of the Galaxy, TRANSFORMERS movie, both coming in the summer but space -- Spider-Man movie coming, which is very exciting, that's a great brand for us, and we're looking forward to executing that across multiple platforms. MY LITTLE PONY comes in the fall, and in October and then you have Thor, of course, you have Ep 8 -- Episode 8, sorry, STAR WARS Episode 8 in October. So a great spread of entertainment and then combine that with our television efforts across multiple platforms and then the Walt DISNEY company with its television efforts across Spider-Man, Avengers and Guardians, we have a very robust lineup for 2017 that we're very excited about, both from Hasbro having 2 animated films and multiple TV series as well as our partners.

But our market share in Australia has also grown despite that short-term issue. In China, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth. The teams are really executing around the blueprint. If you go to stores in China, what you see is our brands coming to life between consumer products as well as our toys and Games, our entertainment on the area there as well obviously our movies are incredibly important. And TRANSFORMERS, as you know, is one of the most well-known brands in China and beloved, and it's an area for us of significant opportunity for long-term growth between that and several of our other brands that we've launched across franchise and Partner Brands. In Brazil, we've seen great growth. In fact, in Brazil, we enjoyed the position of #1 doll line right now with BABY ALIVE, it's a category where the baby doll business particularly is strong. We've seen overall global growth for BABY ALIVE, but Brazil is particularly baby doll market. And if you think about terms of inventory clearly underlying terms of inventory and our business is growing. When you add new initiatives, you need to provide inventory to satisfy the demand for those new initiatives and not cannibalize those to the rest of your business because these are additive opportunities, and we're seeing great acceleration in POS for those new initiatives, be it DISNEY PRINCESS or FROZEN and then next several weeks, we'll see Trolls movie hits theaters around the world and of course, we're lining up for the Trolls business across a multitude of categories and segments and very excited about that. YO-KAI WATCH, as I noted, was some additional inventory that is already paying dividends and that the takeaway, particularly in some International markets where we have great TV placement is doing quite well. So our terms of inventory and our management of inventory continues to improve. We continue to get leverage in our business over time and make improvements in operating margins overtime as a company, and that's our objective overtime is to grow operating profit faster than revenues, and we've done that in the quarter and the intent to continue to do that."

The Hasbro team delivered a tremendous third quarter, the highest revenue and earnings quarter in Hasbro's history. Revenues grew 14% behind innovative products and engaging storytelling, increasing across all major operating segments and geographies. 
Operating profit increased faster than revenues, up 19%, and we continued investing to profitably grow for years to come. Our financial position is strong, and we returned $112 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. 
As we develop Hasbro into a global play and entertainment company, we have built robust brand building capabilities, including storytelling that supports an expensive brand portfolio. 
Today, we're garnering a greater share of life than ever before by reaching broader demographics, play experiences and geographies. Our innovation marketing and investments are informed by the global consumer insights we are uncovering as we engage with consumers and audiences across touch points and mediums. The investments we have made in our digital expertise enable our global teams to develop immersive brand experiences, which, in turn, elevate our connection with consumers and fans. 
This has far-reaching implications in how we develop brands, engage with consumers, tell stories and spend our marketing dollars. Our digital expertise is differentiating our brands. Thus far, in 2016, videos Hasbro curated or created, along with user-generated content, garnered nearly 5 billion views. 
Third quarter revenues grew at a double-digit pace in both the U.S. and Canada and International segments. Developed economies, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., France and Italy each grew revenues double digits. Emerging markets increased 16%, with strong growth in Latin America, including Brazil, as well as in Asia, including China. The industry also continued to grow, up 6% through August according to industry and company estimates. And Hasbro is gaining share. Importantly, we gained share in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia as well as developed economies, including the U.S., U.K., Spain, Italy and Australia. 
Global point of sale increased slightly in the quarter, overcoming difficult entertainment comparisons at retail, including a later set date for STAR WARS this year and post movie declines for JURASSIC WORLD. 
Girls and Games POS increased, while Boys and Preschool declined. We are seeing strong POS as we start the fourth quarter. 
In respect to Hasbro's third quarter revenues, Hasbro Franchise Brands increased 2%. This growth was led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF, TRANSFORMERS and PLAY-DOH. NERF grew for the 15th consecutive quarter, while PLAY-DOH extended its growth streak to 20 straight quarters. In addition, TRANSFORMERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues increased. 
Transformers: Robots in Disguise animation as well as streaming content from Machinima is supporting product lines, which have strong initial consumer reaction. Importantly, TRANSFORMERS has good momentum heading into 2017, which marks the first of 3 years with planned major theatrical entertainment. 
We have momentum in our gaming portfolio, with growth in several brands driving the 13% increase in the category. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUEL MASTERS, PIE FACE, SIMON and BOP-IT were among the brands posting positive gains. 
Despite most of MAGIC's revenue not being included in our POS reports, POS for the Games category grew. Hasbro's gaming portfolio is unmatched, and we are cultivating gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms, including face-to-face gaming, off-the-board gaming and digital gaming experiences, notably in mobile. 
One of our newest Games, SPEAK OUT, has generated more than 100 million online views. Consumer takeaway has been extremely strong, and we are working to catch up to demand. 
Within our mobile gaming portfolio, Backflip Studios is scheduled to unveil an all new mobile game, DragonVale World, during the fourth quarter. This marks the first major release for this gaming property since Hasbro took a 70% stake in the studio. 
Backflip has also unveiled several new mobile games this year based on Hasbro brands, including TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS and just last week, MY LITTLE PONY Puzzle Party. 
The MY LITTLE PONY franchise continue to drive brand awareness through the strategic use of entertainment, pop culture events and consumer products expansion. In a very competitive small ball segment, our holiday items and new launches are beginning to drive POS gains in many markets around the world. In 2017, the MY LITTLE PONY movie will bring global audiences to all new whirls with both the core cast of characters, along with all new characters. 
In addition to our Franchise Brand and gaming portfolio, innovative new offerings at a variety of price points delivered growth for Baby Alive, FURBY and FurReal Friends. 
Within our Partner Brands portfolio, revenues increased 19%, driven by positive contributions from Hasbro's shipments of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and YO-KAI WATCH. For the full year, we now expect Partner Brand revenues to approach 30% of total Hasbro revenue. Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN is off to a strong start behind a favorable reception to our core shimmer fashion doll assortment. 
Overall, the brands are ahead of our plans for the year, and we recently expanded our offering with new holiday items as well as new items in support of entertainment for Elena of Avalor and MOANA. 
STAR WARS continues to be a top global property with strong consumer and retail support around the world. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story product was on-shelf September 30, which was several weeks later than last year's on-shelf date of September 4. This shift most notably impacted our U.S. POS results. Our expectation remains that our 2016 STAR WARS revenue may match the level we achieved in 2015. 
In addition, YO-KAI WATCH and DREAMWORKS' TROLLS contributed to our Partner Brand portfolio gains this quarter. YO-KAI WATCH is now available in global markets, including strong initial performances in several countries. Our DREAMWORKS' TROLLS line hits shelves in the third quarter. Working closely with DreamWorks throughout the development of the movie, we have a robust offering of dolls, flash games and more in support of the global movie premieres over the next several weeks. 
In closing, we've made great strides throughout 2016, including the third quarter, which historically is the largest revenue quarter of our year. Hasbro and our retailers are well positioned to deliver on what we expect to be a strong holiday season for Hasbro brands. Our initiatives are resonating with consumers, and we have good retailers support. 
In addition, inventory available at retail and at Hasbro is improved from this time last year. We are very well positioned heading into 2017 when the entertainment lineup from Hasbro and our partners is among the best we have ever experienced. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,318900558,1055774,"Hasbro Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter result highlighted the strength of Hasbro's business across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top",1340,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter result highlighted the strength of Hasbro's business across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top and bottom line, and we're set for a strong finish to the year. 
14% quarterly revenue growth drove a 19% increase in quarterly operating profit. We grew margins, while investing in our business, in innovation across our brand portfolio, in storytelling across mediums, in our consumer product global talent and in digital expertise, including projects for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and new gaming launches at Backflip Studios. 
Over the trailing 12-month period, we generated $637 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with $830 million in cash on our balance sheet. 
As we look to the full year, we have good momentum in our brands, including our new line supporting DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN. 
In addition, we're supporting more motion pictures in the fourth quarter than last year. We have the right inventory and the right places, both at retail and in our warehouses to support this momentum. 
For the third quarter 2016, we grew revenues in each major operating segment. In the U.S. and Canada segment, revenues increased 16%. Revenue growth in the Games and Girls categories more than offset declines in the Boys and Preschool categories. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues grew 2%, with growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF and TRANSFORMERS. 
Partner Brand revenues increased 13% in the segment, behind contributions from Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and to a lesser extent, YO-KAI WATCH. 
Additional Hasbro brands, including Baby Alive, EASY BAKE, PIE FACE and FURBY also contributed to the year-over-year growth for the segment. 
U.S. point of sale declined slightly in the quarter, given difficult comparisons to JURASSIC WORLD and a shift in timing for STAR WARS on shelf dates versus last year. POS increased in the mid-teens for the first 3 quarters and is positive to start the fourth quarter. 
Retail inventory continue to be a very good quality and has grown primarily from the addition of new initiative. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 22% to $228 million or 24.4% of net revenues. Similar to prior quarters this year, higher revenues drove improved expense leverage. 
International segment revenues grew 13%, including a negative $3 million impact from foreign exchange. Within the International segment, the Boys, Girls and Preschool categories grew, while the Games category was flat. 
Franchise Brand revenues increased 4% with growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, NERF and TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues increased 30% behind Hasbro shipments of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, YO-KAI WATCH and DREAMWORKS' TROLLS. Hasbro brands Baby Alive and PIE FACE also contributed to the segment's strong performance. Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $133.1 million or 19.3% of net revenues. 
The International segment continued to generate greater expense leverage. Through the first 9 months of the year, currency is negatively impacted revenues by $49.1 million. Based on current economic trends, we anticipate a potential further impact of up to approximately $25 million for the remainder of the year. Despite an improved currency translation outlook from where we began the year, the impact from currency varies by market, and our global teams continue to manage the ongoing economic impact on retailers and consumers from currency devaluations in several markets around the world. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 8% behind revenue growth in consumer product Licensing and Digital Gaming. Segment operating profit decreased $2.2 million or 13% to $14.1 million or 25.1% of net revenues. 
Higher revenues and lower program production amortization were partially offset by investments in building our consumer products team globally and higher expenses at Backflip Studios in support of new gaming launches. Boulder Media revenue and expenses are being recorded in the segment and were not material in the quarter. 
Overall, operating profit increased 19%, and operating profit margin gained 100 basis points versus last year. Double-digit revenue growth drove improved expense leverage for the quarter as well as year-to-date. For the full year, we anticipate operating margin in line with or up slightly from last year. 
Cost of sales in the third quarter declined slightly as a percentage of sales and continue to benefit from growth in Partner Brands. This growth in Partner Brand revenue also led to an increase in royalties, which, at 8% of revenues, is up 30 basis points year-over-year. We now expect royalties for the full year to be in the range of our year-to-date level of 8.1% of revenues and last year's level of 8.5%. 
Program production cost amortization declined in the quarter and is running lower in 2016 than last year as we have delivered in our amortizing fewer television programs. 
Content development and storytelling remained core to our strategic investments, and we've spent $36 million in cash on television and film production over the first 9 months of the year. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we acquired Boulder Media to enhance our animation and storytelling expertise. 
SD&A as a percentage of sales is up slightly versus last year. The increase reflected higher spending on digital programs, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Backflip. Compensation expense increased during the quarter, and we anticipate will increase further in the fourth quarter as we true-up 2 years of successful performance on long-term plans versus measures we set several years ago. 
Turning to our results below operating profit. Other income was $8.5 million versus $5.1 million last year. The improvement resulted from a small foreign currency translation gain this year versus a loss last year and, to a lesser extent, higher interest income and growth in earnings from our share of the Discovery Family Channel. 
On a reported basis, the third quarter of 2015 included a $6.8 million gain from the sale of 2 manufacturing facilities. 
Absent the gain, other expense was $1.7 million last year. 
The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.2% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. Diluted earnings per share was $2.03 compared to EPS of $1.64 last year. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Strong cash generation enabled us not only to invest in growing Hasbro, but also to return cash to our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $112.4 million to shareholders, $64 million in dividends and $48.4 million in share repurchases. We've spent $106 million in share repurchases through the first 3 quarters of 2016. This is in line with our full year target of repurchasing $100 million to $150 million, which, as always, is subject to market conditions. 
Receivables at quarter end increased 5% versus the 14% revenue growth, and DSOs decreased 7 days to 78 days. Our accounts receivable remain in good condition and collections continue to be strong. 
Inventories increased 36% versus last year. The overall quality of this inventory is good, and our inventory availability has improved from this point last year. More than $100 million of the year-over-year increase is in DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, YO-KAI WATCH and Trolls, which are all new lines for Hasbro. And for PIE FACE, which is a much bigger business this year than last. 
We're also supporting multiple films in the fourth quarter, including Rogue One. The later on-shelf date and our better inventory availability for this line resulted in Hasbro having more inventory on our books at quarter-end than last year. At year-end, we believe we will have the appropriate inventory to support our lines as well as new initiatives occurring early in 2017, including DISNEY'S live-action, Beauty and the Beast film. 
Finally, our retail inventories have grown in support of the successful new initiatives in growing Hasbro brands. 
In closing, we have the right brand, the right assets and the right teams to deliver a successful year. And we remain committed to taking the right strategic steps to position Hasbro for 2017 and beyond.

I appreciate the $100 million of incremental brands that you didn't have last year, but even excluding that, the inventory balance was still up into the teens. So can you maybe explain a little bit of where that inventory is basketed and where we should look for that inventory to progress here over the next kind of 90 to 120 days? And then just secondly, your operating profit in the U.S. in the North American segment was very, very strong. I'm wondering if that's something that we should look forward going forward to continue to be strong? Or if there was something unique in the quarter that allowed you to really stretch up into the mid-20s?"

Well, why don't I take the inventory question and then maybe Brian can talk about operating profit in the U.S. But from an inventory standpoint, our inventory is up. If you recall at the end of the third quarter last year, we were chasing some product, and we had only begun to start introducing the -- or building to introduce PIE FACE a little bit later in the year. So about half of the increase in our inventory is in -- it sits in our International segments, where, believe it or not, at the end of the quarter, we had positive -- we had an increase because of FX, just the way the rates landed at the end of the quarter versus throughout the whole period. So the remainder of the inventory, we -- the $100 million of increase really was due to new lines. The additional piece is due to being in a better position for some of the things that are doing very well this year, like NERF and PLAY-DOH. In addition, we have STAR WARS inventory, which was for Rogue One watch happened at September 30, which was a first Friday, was September 4 a year ago. So overall, this just contributed to having a bit more inventory and place at the end of the quarter, but at a lower percentage increase. And I think what we saw at the end of the second quarter, and as we look to year end, we will be in a good position. We do expect inventory to be up, but not by as much at the end of the year as we have some great new launches coming in the first quarter of 2017, including DISNEY'S live-action Beauty and the Beast, which happens early in the quarter. So we do expect to see inventory up, but at a lower rate."

We are, in fact, seeing really strong POS trends entering the fourth quarter, particularly in the U.S. We saw a little bit of softness in POS in the late summer, July, August period. And then in September, given the shift in STAR WARS as well as the impact from Jurassic, that impacted our U.S. POS. Internationally, we're seeing very strong POS up double digits in Europe, up in Latin America, up year-to-date in Asia Pacific. And then in the quarter in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, recently, we've seen some retail issues with a retailer where there was just less inventory taken and a little bit less of a sell-through and therefore impacted that half of number, the Asia Pacific number because of Australia. So overall, we feel very good about the POS trends year-to-date and the POS trends going into fourth quarter with a little bit of a note in the third quarter due to some of those timing shifts and some of the brands that have come down significantly versus a year ago. As we think about DISNEY PRINCESS, it's performing incredibly strongly, and it's ahead of our original plan for the year. Our global teams, in partnership with DISNEY, are doing an excellent job. And in fact, we're seeing great growth from areas like our Royal Shimmer fashion dolls, that's the all 11 princesses, not even including Anna and Elsa. For the holidays, we have a big presence coming for the Royal Dreams fashion doll, Castle, so we even give Girls great places to play with their dolls. Deb mentioned some of the entertainment. But also note that in 2017 in the first quarter, we'll have the broadcast premiere of FROZEN. We'll have a holiday special next year from FROZEN. We also have Elena of Avalor, which is off to a very strong start as a television initiative. And then we're also very excited about the launch of MOANA. So all of those elements leading to a very strong Princess business. And we've made great strides and making great progress there toward our long-term objective of growing that business far beyond where it had been in the past."

In fact, the Girls business would have been up in the third quarter absent PRINCESS and FROZEN. So our Boys business because of NERF, where NERF business is up significantly, TRANSFORMERS business in the quarter was up. We're really seeing how the addition of fan-oriented content that started this season on Machinima combined with our core Boys entertainment, combined with our Preschool Boys entertainment is really driving that brand. And we're going to take it to the next level and set it up really well for 2017 when we go into a first year of 3 anticipated movies over the next 3 years.

Last year, which was in our third quarter and this year, it's our week 40, which is in our fourth quarter. So as Deb noted, it means that the inventory for that initiative was on our books at the end of the third quarter. It wasn't yet really out at retail significantly it was a year ago. So therefore, you didn't have that the rate of sell-through on POS. And so you saw that reflected in our third quarter POS, particularly in the U.S. business. Internationally, you didn't see quite the same impact. So overall, I would say a couple of things. First, STAR WARS year-to-date sales, revenues, are up significantly through the third quarter. So as we look at the full year, we look at International POS. And the POS we're seeing coming into the fourth quarter, now that we have inventory, we, again, reiterate our belief that 2015 levels could equal 2016 levels for the STAR WARS brand."

So this year, we've done a better job across the company, particularly in our U.S. business to ensure we had inventories of great initiatives that we're selling at a high rate. So our retail inventories are up, but up around the brands that are selling quite well, and so we're in support of those. Our percent in stocks have improved year-on-year, that's something that we care about. We want to make our shelf spaces productive as possible in partnership with our retailers. But equally importantly, we are seeing significant increases in online sales. And those online sales are severalfold higher than our overall sales. And we're also seeing online sales increases across every one of our categories. And this is U.S. data, where whether it's Boys, Girls, Preschool or Games, we're seeing significant online sales increases. So where we are able to provide our product lines and our brands directly to the consumer via our retail partners online, we are seeing great takeaway and our brands are really resonating. So that also for us is a great bellwether for how consumers are responding to our products and brands."

We're doing a better job in placing our content around the continent and getting our content played with major broadcasters. We have around the world, so this includes Europe as well as other global players more than 50 SVOD platforms that are now playing our content.

If you look at the mix, it's a bit more mix toward lower-priced products. And that has to do with the fact that there's some lower-price SKUs from prior product inventory that are still selling through in the third quarter. So overall, we're seeing growth in our business. And we're seeing like-for-like stronger take away for our products, but we're also seeing stronger takeaway into the third quarter for lower-priced products that will be eliminated over the next quarter or 2. We're seeing great takeaway in the fashion dolls offering all 11 fashion dolls. We're seeing great early takeaway from Elena of Avalor. So again, overall PRINCESS and FROZEN performing well. And FROZEN, what's great is that the brand is performing, for us, at quite a strong level. And FROZEN has even more of an international footprint than the PRINCESS business on a percentage basis, so more countries around the world are really focusing in on FROZEN with great results globally. And you see that indicated in some of our POS data as FROZEN tend -- is tending to be slightly more internationally oriented on percentage terms. Obviously, we're benefiting from a great campaign that's began this fall called Dream Big PRINCESS in partnership with the DISNEY company. And of course, we're very much looking forward to all of the new entertainment coming next year, the broadcast debut of FROZEN, the FROZEN holiday special. First quarter, seeing a Beauty and the Beast live-action movie, Elena of Avalor on television and, of course, MOANA coming in the next few weeks."

So if you look at Boys business in the quarter, the biggest decline both for Boys and for our company in the quarter was Jurassic, that's the impact that it had. In the quarter, MARVEL is up a bit in the Boys business. Our action figure business is performing at quite a high level. We had -- it was a strong contributor to the quarter. We had great partnership on Superhero Spectacular Retail program with DISNEY and with MARVEL. Our MARVEL Legends business is performing quite well. Spider-Man is also performing quite strongly, which is a great lead into next year's movie. And so that's what we're seeing. We're also have got a lot of fan-oriented product. It's one of the brands that's responding the most to our fan orientation and fanning the flames of our fans and providing product to them that they really like and offering that online. And you'll see some products for fans around Dr. Strange. As you go forward, NERF is growing dramatically for both quarter as well as year-to-date. STAR WARS, as I said, year-to-date is up significantly down in the quarter. And TRANSFORMERS is up. As I noted, TRANSFORMERS is up pretty substantially in the quarter and it has to do with the fact that we continue to improve the blueprint and add elements to the blueprint this quarter with the Machinima content running, the Combiner Wars and that product performing at quite a strong level. So TRANSFORMERS business is doing well. We also add to that Backflip Studios, TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS, which is all around Combiner Wars. So again, executing that blueprint. We even had fan-created product in the quarter, which is a combiner called Victorion created by fans. We're allowing fans to curate, along with the content that we're streaming, so 3 types of contents into the strong lead-in to our 2017 plans for TRANSFORMERS. In addition, I forgot to mention, but in MARVEL, we have very strong plans leading to next year in 2017, obviously, with Guardians of the Galaxy, with the Spider-Man movie and a Thor movie. So it's a -- we're in a good position on the MARVEL Boys business overall. And then of course, a new initiative that's working particularly well in early days internationally is YO-KAI WATCH. We've just started launch in international markets, and we're seeing some great takeaway there. So overall, there's kind of our Boys line up. And as I've said on STAR WARS, to repeat, we do expect that STAR WARS could equal STAR WARS levels of 2015 across the company."

You're going to see, in 2017, 2 Hasbro films, so certainly TRANSFORMERS. You're also going to see a MY LITTLE PONY animated feature in the fall. The opportunity in TRANSFORMERS is to take the storytelling into movies for multiple years, and you'll see that in '17, '18 and '19 with different kinds of stories being told. So not every movie will be the same, but every movie continues to add to the character and story of the property. And when we first started, our objective was always to build the brand enterprise value through the blueprint. And so this is the next logical step. I took a step back as we came into the third quarter call just to give a perspective on our Franchise Brands and brands like TRANSFORMERS. So I looked at Franchise Brands as we were sitting here at the end of the third quarter 2013 and take it today, year-to-date versus year-to-date, '13 versus '16, our Franchise Brands are up 33%. And that's the view we take to our businesses is that longer view of building brands over time, adding elements to our blueprint, adding capabilities and taking our brands over time to the next level. So that's indicative of the way that we think about Franchise Brands. So TRANSFORMERS steps up. MY LITTLE PONY steps up for next year. And then in the next couple of years, you'll also see LITTLEST PET SHOP stepping up to more content in a number of ways."

And that's quite good for our business and good for the way we think about executing our blueprint. In the first quarter, you don't have new initiatives coming from DISNEY and Beauty and the Beast live action. There's a Wolverine movie coming that helps to continue to support the X-Men business. And then Guardians of the Galaxy, a TRANSFORMERS movie, both coming in the summer but spaced. Spider-Man movie coming, which is very exciting, that's a great brand for us, and we're looking forward to really executing that across multiple platforms. MY LITTLE PONY comes in the fall in October. And then you have Thor. And of course, then you have Ep 8 -- Episode 8 -- sorry, STAR WARS Episode 8 in December, so a great spread of entertainment. And then combine that with our television efforts across multiple platforms, and then the Walt Disney Company with its television efforts across Spider-Man, Avengers and Guardians, we have a very robust lineup for 2017 that we're very excited about, both from Hasbro having 2 animated films and multiple TV series as well as our partners.

But our market share in Australia has also grown despite that short-term issue. In China, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth. The teams are really executing around the blueprint. And if you go to stores in China, what you see is our brands coming to life between consumer products as well as our toys and games, our entertainment on the air there. As well obviously, our movies are incredibly important. And TRANSFORMERS, as you know, is one of the most well-known brands in China and beloved. And it's an area for us of significant opportunity for long-term growth between that and several of our other brands that we've launched across Franchise and Partner Brands. In Brazil, we've seen great growth. In fact, in Brazil, we enjoyed the position of #1 doll line right now with BABY ALIVE. It's a category where the baby doll business particularly is strong. We've seen overall global growth for BABY ALIVE. But Brazil is particularly baby doll market. And if you think about turns of inventory, clearly, underlying turns of inventory and our business is growing. When you add new initiatives, you need to provide inventory to satisfy the demand for those new initiatives and not cannibalize those to the rest of your business because these are additive opportunities. And we're seeing great acceleration in POS for those new initiatives, be it DISNEY PRINCESS or FROZEN. And then in the next several weeks, we'll see Trolls movie hit theaters around the world. And of course, we're lining up for the Trolls business across a multitude of categories and segments, and very excited about that. YO-KAI WATCH, as I noted, was some additional inventory that is already paying dividends in that the takeaway, particularly in some international markets where we have great TV placement is doing quite well. So our turns of inventory and our management of inventory continues to improve. We continue to get leverage in our business over time and make improvements in operating margins over time as a company.

They're a bit heavier in this year given the number of new initiatives that we are launching for the first time, particularly PRINCESS and FROZEN. And obviously, that has an impact in the early days on operating margin given that we are building our economy of scale and expertise and investment in that area. And that we do believe, over time, the operating margin for PRINCESS approaches run rate operating margin for our Partner Brands. We've made great progress there. We're ahead of where we thought we'd be this time in the year. But we still have a long way to go toward the opportunity to grow that business over time."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team delivered a tremendous third quarter, the highest revenue and earnings quarter in Hasbro's history.

The Hasbro team delivered a tremendous third quarter, the highest revenue and earnings quarter in Hasbro's history. Revenues grew 14% behind innovative products and engaging storytelling, increasing across all major operating segments and geographies. 
Operating profit increased faster than revenues, up 19%, and we continued investing to profitably grow for years to come. Our financial position is strong, and we returned $112 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. 
As we develop Hasbro into a global play and entertainment company, we have built robust brand-building capabilities, including storytelling, that supports an expansive brand portfolio. 
Today, we're garnering a greater share of life than ever before by reaching broader demographics, play experiences and geographies. Our innovation marketing and investments are informed by the global consumer insights we are uncovering as we engage with consumers and audiences across touchpoints and mediums. The investments we have made in our digital expertise enable our global teams to develop immersive brand experiences, which in turn elevate our connection with consumers and fans. 
This has far-reaching implications in how we develop brands, engage with consumers, tell stories and spend our marketing dollars. Our digital expertise is differentiating our brands. Thus far, in 2016, videos Hasbro curated or created, along with user-generated content, garnered nearly 5 billion views. 
Third quarter revenues grew at a double-digit pace in both the U.S. and Canada and International segments. Developed economies, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., France and Italy each grew revenues double digits. Emerging markets increased 16% with strong growth in Latin America, including Brazil, as well as in Asia, including China. The industry also continued to grow, up 6% through August, according to industry and company estimates. And Hasbro is gaining share. Importantly, we gained share in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia as well as developed economies, including the U.S., U.K., Spain, Italy and Australia. 
Global point of sale increased slightly in the quarter, overcoming difficult entertainment comparisons at retail, including a later set date for STAR WARS this year and post movie declines for JURASSIC WORLD. 
Girls and Games POS increased, while Boys and Preschool declined. We are seeing strong POS as we start the fourth quarter. 
In respect to Hasbro's third quarter revenues, Hasbro Franchise Brands increased 2%. This growth was led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF, TRANSFORMERS and PLAY-DOH. NERF grew for the 15th consecutive quarter, while PLAY-DOH extended its growth streak to 20 straight quarters. In addition, TRANSFORMERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues increased. 
TRANSFORMERS: ROBOTS IN disguise animation as well as streaming content from Machinima is supporting product lines which have strong initial consumer reaction. Importantly, TRANSFORMERS has good momentum heading into 2017, which marks the first of 3 years with planned major theatrical entertainment. 
We have momentum in our gaming portfolio, with growth in several brands driving the 13% increase in the category. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUEL MASTERS, PIE FACE, SIMON and BOP-IT were among the brands posting positive gains. 
Despite most of MAGIC's revenue not being included in our POS reports, POS for the Games category grew. Hasbro's gaming portfolio is unmatched, and we are cultivating gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms, including face-to-face gaming, off-the-board gaming and digital gaming experiences, notably in mobile. 
One of our newest Games, SPEAK OUT, has generated more than 100 million online views. Consumer takeaway has been extremely strong, and we are working to catch up to demand. 
Within our mobile gaming portfolio, Backflip Studios is scheduled to unveil an all new mobile game, DRAGONVALE WORLD, during the fourth quarter. This marks the first major release for this gaming property since Hasbro took a 70% stake in the studio. 
Backflip has also unveiled several new mobile games this year based on Hasbro brands, including TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS and just last week, MY LITTLE PONY: PUZZLE PARTY. 
The MY LITTLE PONY franchise continued to drive brand awareness through the strategic use of entertainment, pop-culture events and consumer products expansion. In a very competitive small-ball segment, our holiday items and new launches are beginning to drive POS gains in many markets around the world. In 2017, the MY LITTLE PONY movie will bring global audiences to all new worlds with both the core cast of characters along with all new characters. 
In addition to our Franchise Brand and Gaming portfolio, innovative new offerings at a variety of price points delivered growth for BABY ALIVE, FURBY and FURREAL FRIENDS. 
Within our Partner Brands' portfolio, revenues increased 19%, driven by positive contributions from Hasbro's shipments of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and YO-KAI WATCH. For the full year, we now expect Partner Brand revenues to approach 30% of total Hasbro revenue. Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN is off to a strong start behind a favorable reception to our core shimmer fashion doll assortment. 
Overall, the brands are ahead of our plans for the year, and we recently expanded our offering with new holiday items as well as new items in support of entertainment for Elena of Avalor and MOANA. 
STAR WARS continues to be a top global property with strong consumer and retail support around the world. ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY product was on shelf September 30, which was several weeks later than last year's on-shelf date of September 4. This shift most notably impacted our U.S. POS results. Our expectation remains that our 2016 STAR WARS revenue may match the level we achieved in 2015. 
In addition, YO-KAI WATCH and DREAMWORKS' TROLLS contributed to our Partner Brand portfolio gains this quarter. YO-KAI WATCH is now available in global markets, including strong initial performances in several countries. Our DREAMWORKS' TROLLS line hits shelves in the third quarter. Working closely with DreamWorks throughout the development of the movie, we have a robust offering of dolls, plush, games and more in support of the global movie premieres over the next several weeks. 
In closing, we've made great strides throughout 2016, including the third quarter, which historically is the largest revenue quarter of our year. Hasbro and our retailers are well positioned to deliver on what we expect to be a strong holiday season for Hasbro brands. Our initiatives are resonating with consumers, and we have good retailer support. 
In addition, inventory available at retail and at Hasbro is improved from this time last year. We are very well positioned heading into 2017 when the entertainment lineup from Hasbro and our partners is among the best we have ever experienced. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,318900558,1055881,"Hasbro Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter result highlighted the strength of Hasbro's business across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top",1339,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter result highlighted the strength of Hasbro's business across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top and bottom line, and we're set for a strong finish to the year. 
14% quarterly revenue growth drove a 19% increase in quarterly operating profit. We grew margins while investing in our business, in innovation across our brand portfolio, in storytelling across mediums, in our consumer product global talent and in digital expertise, including projects for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and new gaming launches at Backflip Studios. 
Over the trailing 12-month period, we generated $637 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with $830 million in cash on our balance sheet. 
As we look to the full year, we have good momentum in our brands, including our new line supporting DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN. 
In addition, we're supporting more motion pictures in the fourth quarter than last year. We have the right inventory in the right places, both at retail and in our warehouses to support this momentum. 
For the third quarter 2016, we grew revenues in each major operating segment. In the U.S. and Canada segment, revenues increased 16%. Revenue growth in the Games and Girls categories more than offset declines in the Boys and Preschool categories. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues grew 2% with growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF and TRANSFORMERS. 
Partner Brand revenues increased 13% in the segment, behind contributions from Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and to a lesser extent, YO-KAI WATCH. 
Additional Hasbro brands, including BABY ALIVE, EASY BAKE, PIE FACE and FURBY also contributed to the year-over-year growth for the segment. 
U.S. point of sale declined slightly in the quarter, given difficult comparisons to JURASSIC WORLD and a shift in timing for STAR WARS on-shelf dates versus last year. POS increased in the mid-teens for the first 3 quarters and is positive to start the fourth quarter. 
Retail inventory continued to be a very good quality and has grown primarily from the addition of new initiatives. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 22% to $228 million or 24.4% of net revenues. Similar to prior quarters this year, higher revenues drove improved expense leverage. 
International segment revenues grew 13%, including a negative $3 million impact from foreign exchange. Within the International segment, the Boys, Girls and Preschool categories grew while the Games category was flat. 
Franchise Brand revenues increased 4% with growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, NERF and TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues increased 30% behind Hasbro shipments of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, YO-KAI WATCH and DREAMWORKS' TROLLS. Hasbro brands BABY ALIVE and PIE FACE also contributed to the segment's strong performance. Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $133.1 million or 19.3% of net revenues. 
The International segment continued to generate greater expense leverage. Through the first 9 months of the year, currency is negatively impacted revenues by $49.1 million. Based on current economic trends, we anticipate a potential further impact of up to approximately $25 million for the remainder of the year. Despite an improved currency translation outlook from where we began the year, the impact from currency varies by market, and our global teams continue to manage the ongoing economic impact on retailers and consumers from currency devaluations in several markets around the world. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 8% behind revenue growth in consumer product licensing and digital gaming. Segment operating profit decreased $2.2 million or 13% to $14.1 million or 25.1% of net revenues. 
Higher revenues and lower program production amortization were partially offset by investments in building our consumer products team globally and higher expenses at Backflip Studios in support of new gaming launches. Boulder Media revenue and expenses are being recorded in the segment and were not material in the quarter. 
Overall, operating profit increased 19%, and operating profit margin gained 100 basis points versus last year. Double-digit revenue growth drove improved expense leverage for the quarter as well as year-to-date. For the full year, we anticipate operating margin in line with or up slightly from last year. 
Cost of sales in the third quarter declined slightly as a percentage of sales and continues to benefit from growth in Partner Brands. This growth in Partner Brand revenue also led to an increase in royalties, which, at 8% of revenues, is up 30 basis points year-over-year. We now expect royalties for the full year to be in the range of our year-to-date level of 8.1% of revenues and last year's level of 8.5%. 
Program production cost amortization declined in the quarter and is running lower in 2016 than last year as we have delivered and our amortizing fewer television programs. 
Content development and storytelling remain core to our strategic investments, and we've spent $36 million in cash on television and film production over the first 9 months of the year. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we acquired Boulder Media to enhance our animation and storytelling expertise. 
SD&A as a percentage of sales was up slightly versus last year. The increase reflected higher spending on digital programs, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and BACKFLIP. Compensation expense increased during the quarter and we anticipate will increase further in the fourth quarter as we true up 2 years of successful performance on long-term plans versus measures we set several years ago. 
Turning to our results below operating profit. Other income was $8.5 million versus $5.1 million last year. The improvement resulted from a small foreign currency translation gain this year versus a loss last year and, to a lesser extent, higher interest income and growth in earnings from our share of the Discovery Family Channel. 
On a reported basis, the third quarter of 2015 included a $6.8 million gain from the sale of 2 manufacturing facilities. 
Absent the gain, other expense was $1.7 million last year. 
The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.2% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. Diluted earnings per share was $2.03 compared to EPS of $1.64 last year. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Strong cash generation enabled us not only to invest in growing Hasbro but also to return cash to our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $112.4 million to shareholders, $64 million in dividends and $48.4 million in share repurchases. We've spent $106 million in share repurchases through the first 3 quarters of 2016. This is in line with our full year target of repurchasing $100 million to $150 million, which, as always, is subject to market conditions. 
Receivables at quarter-end increased 5% versus the 14% revenue growth, and DSOs decreased 7 days to 78 days. Our accounts receivable remain in good condition and collections continue to be strong. 
Inventories increased 36% versus last year. The overall quality of this inventory is good, and our inventory availability has improved from this point last year. More than $100 million of the year-over-year increase is in DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN; YO-KAI WATCH and Trolls, which are all new lines for Hasbro; and for PIE FACE, which is a much bigger business this year than last. 
We're also supporting multiple films in the fourth quarter, including ROGUE ONE. The later on-shelf date and our better inventory availability for this line resulted in Hasbro having more inventory on our books at quarter-end than last year. At year-end, we believe we will have the appropriate inventory to support our lines as well as new initiatives occurring early in 2017, including DISNEY'S live-action, Beauty and the Beast film. 
Finally, our retail inventories have grown in support of the successful new initiatives in growing Hasbro brands. 
In closing, we have the right brands, the right assets and the right teams to deliver a successful year. And we remain committed to taking the right strategic steps to position Hasbro for 2017 and beyond.

So can you maybe explain a little bit of where that inventory is basket-ed and where we should look for that inventory to progress here over the next kind of 90 to 120 days? And then just secondly, your operating profit in the U.S. -- or in the North American segment was very, very strong. I'm wondering if that's something that we should look for going forward to continue to be strong?

Well, why don't I take the inventory question and then maybe Brian can talk about operating profit in the U.S. But from an inventory standpoint, our inventory is up. If you recall at the end of the third quarter last year, we were chasing some product, and we had only begun to start introducing the -- or building to introduce PIE FACE a little bit later in the year. So about half of the increase in our inventory is in -- it sits in our International segments, where, believe it or not, at the end of the quarter, we had positive -- we had an increase because of FX, just the way the rates landed at the end of the quarter versus throughout the whole period. So the remainder of the inventory, we -- the $100 million of increase really was due to new lines. The additional piece is due to being in a better position for some of the things that are doing very well this year, like NERF and PLAY-DOH. In addition, we have STAR WARS inventory, which was for Rogue One launch happened at September 30, which was at -- first Friday was September 4 a year ago. So overall, this just contributed to having a bit more inventory and place at the end of the quarter but at a lower percentage increase than I think what we saw at the end of the second quarter, and as we look to year-end, we will be in a good position. We do expect inventory to be up but not by as much at the end of the year as we have some great new launches coming in the first quarter of 2017, including DISNEY'S live-action Beauty and the Beast, which happens early in the quarter. So we do expect to see inventory up but at a lower rate."

So again, that's an opportunity as we think about the full year. So the team continues to do a very strong job in marketing and looking at expenses and working with retailers to ensure they have great inventory that's delivered more just in time and managing a strong P&L."

Or is there a shortfall in one of your Franchise Brands? That's my first question. Second question is on POS. I think you mentioned that it was up modestly in the third quarter, but you were seeing an uptick at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Are you suggesting that you're seeing an acceleration?

We are, in fact, seeing really strong POS trends entering the fourth quarter, particularly in the U.S. We saw a little bit of softness in POS in the late summer, July/August period. And then in September, given the shift in STAR WARS as well as the impact from Jurassic, that impacted our U.S. POS. Internationally, we're seeing very strong POS up double digits in Europe, up in Latin America, up year-to-date in Asia Pacific. And then in the quarter in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, recently, we've seen some retail issues with a retailer where there was just less inventory taken and a little bit less of a sell-through and, therefore, impacted that happen [ph] number, the Asia Pacific number because of Australia. So overall, we feel very good about the POS trends year-to-date and the POS trends going into fourth quarter with a little bit of a note in the third quarter due to some of those timing shifts in some of the brands that have come down significantly versus year ago. As we think about DISNEY PRINCESS, it's performing incredibly strongly, and it's ahead of our original plan for the year. Our global teams, in partnership with DISNEY, are doing an excellent job. And in fact, we're seeing great growth from areas like our Royal Shimmer fashion dolls, that's the all 11 princesses, not even including Anna and Elsa. For the holidays, we have a big presence coming for the Royal Dreams fashion doll castle, so we even give girls great places to play with their dolls. Deb mentioned some of the entertainment but also note that in 2017 in the first quarter, we'll have the broadcast premiere of FROZEN. We'll have a holiday special next year from FROZEN. We also have Elena of Avalor, which is off to a very strong start as a television initiative. And then we're also very excited about the launch of MOANA. So all of those elements leading to a very strong Princess business. And we've made great strides and making great progress there toward our long-term objective of growing that business far beyond where it had been in the past."

In fact, the Girls business would have been up in the third quarter absent PRINCESS and FROZEN. So our Boys business, because of NERF, where NERF business is up significantly, TRANSFORMERS business in the quarter was up. We're really seeing how the addition of fan-oriented content that started this season on Machinima combined with our core Boys entertainment, combined with our Preschool Boys entertainment is really driving that brand and going to take it to the next level and set it up really well for 2017 when we go into a first year of 3 anticipated movies over the next 3 years.

The shift is really around a lot of the U.S., the way the U.S. retailers really went after Force Friday a year ago. And this year, it was September 30. So that was our Week 36 last year, which was in our third quarter, and this year, it's our Week 40, which is in our fourth quarter. So as Deb noted, it means that the inventory for that initiative was on our books at the end of the third quarter. It wasn't yet really out at retail as significantly it was a year ago. So therefore, you didn't have that the rate of sell-through on POS. And so you saw that reflected in our third quarter POS, particularly in the U.S. business. Internationally, you didn't see quite the same impact. So overall, I would say a couple of things. First, STAR WARS year-to-date sales, revenues, are up significantly through the third quarter. So as we look at the full year, we look at International POS. And the POS we're seeing coming into the fourth quarter, now that we have inventory, we, again, reiterate our belief that 2015 levels could equal 2016 levels for the STAR WARS brand."

We also see the movie as having wonderful play patterns. Obviously, you've seen some of the trailers, and you could imagine all the character play and vehicle play that will come and role play that will come as a result of the movie. And as we've said, we look at the business year-on-year versus quarter-for-quarter, and that's been consistent throughout the year. So we're incredibly excited about this movie.

So our retail inventories are up but up around the brands that are selling quite well, and so we're in support of those. Our percent in stocks have improved year-on-year. That's something that we care about. We want to make our shelf spaces productive as possible in partnership with our retailers. But equally importantly, we are seeing significant increases in online sales. And those online sales are severalfold higher than our overall sales. And we're also seeing online sales increases across every one of our categories.

If you look at the mix, it's a bit more mixed toward lower-priced product.

And we're seeing like-for-like stronger takeaway for our products, but we're also seeing stronger takeaway into the third quarter for lower-priced products that will be eliminated over the next quarter or 2. We're seeing great takeaway in the fashion dolls -- offering all 11 fashion dolls. We're seeing great early takeaway from Elena of Avalor. So again, overall, PRINCESS and FROZEN performing well. And FROZEN, what's great is that the brand is performing, for us, at quite a strong level. And FROZEN has even more of an international footprint than the PRINCESS business on a percentage basis, so more countries around the world are really focusing in on FROZEN with great results globally. And you see that indicated in some of our POS data as FROZEN tend -- is tending to be slightly more internationally oriented on percentage terms. Obviously, we're benefiting from a great campaign that's began this fall called Dream Big PRINCESS in partnership with the DISNEY company. And of course, we're very much looking forward to all of the new entertainment coming next year, the broadcast debut of FROZEN, the FROZEN holiday special.

So if you look at the Boys business in the quarter, the biggest decline both for Boys and for our company in the quarter was Jurassic. That's the impact that it had. In the quarter, MARVEL is up a bit in the Boys business. Our action figure business is performing at quite a high level. We had -- it was a strong contributor to the quarter. We had great partnership on a Superhero Spectacular Retail program with DISNEY and with MARVEL. Our MARVEL Legends business is performing quite well. Spider-Man is also performing quite strongly, which is a great lead into next year's movie. And so that's what we're seeing. We're also have got a lot of fan-oriented product. It's one of the brands that's responding the most to our fan orientation and fanning the flames of our fans and providing product to them that they really like and offering that online. And you'll see some products for fans around Dr. Strange. As you go forward, NERF is growing dramatically for both the quarter as well as year-to-date. STAR WARS, as I said, year-to-date is up significantly, down in the quarter. And TRANSFORMERS is up. As I noted, TRANSFORMERS is up pretty substantially in the quarter, and it has to do with the fact that we continue to improve the blueprint and add elements to the blueprint this quarter with the Machinima content running, the Combiner Wars and that product performing at quite a strong level. So TRANSFORMERS business is doing well. We also add to that the Backflip Studios, TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS, which is all around Combiner Wars. So again, executing that blueprint. We even had fan-created product in the quarter, which is a Combiner called Victorion created by fans. We're allowing fans to curate, along with the content that we're streaming, so 3 types of content. It's a strong lead-in to our 2017 plans for TRANSFORMERS. In addition, I forgot to mention, but in MARVEL, we have very strong plans leading to next year in 2017, obviously, with Guardians of the Galaxy, with the Spider-Man movie and a Thor movie. So it's a -- we're in a good position on the MARVEL Boys business overall. And then of course, a new initiative that's working particularly well in early days internationally is YO-KAI WATCH. We've just started to launch in international markets, and we're seeing some great takeaway there. So overall, there's -- they're kind of our Boys lineup. And as I've said on STAR WARS, to repeat, we do expect that STAR WARS could equal STAR WARS levels of 2015 across the company."

The opportunity in TRANSFORMERS is to take the storytelling into movies for multiple years, and you'll see that in '17, '18 and '19 with different kinds of stories being told. So not every movie will be the same, but every movie continues to add to the character and story of the property. And when we first started, our objective was always to build the brand enterprise value through the blueprint. And so this is the next logical step. I took a step back as we came into the third quarter call just to give a perspective on our Franchise Brands and brands like TRANSFORMERS. So I looked at Franchise Brands as we were sitting here at the end of the third quarter 2013 and take it today, year-to-date versus year-to-date, '13 versus '16, our Franchise Brands are up 33%. And that's the view we take to our business is that longer view of building brands over time, adding elements to our blueprint, adding capabilities and taking our brands over time to the next level. So that's indicative of the way that we think about Franchise Brands. So TRANSFORMERS steps up. MY LITTLE PONY steps up for next year. And then in the next couple of years, you'll also see LITTLEST PET SHOP stepping up to more content in a number of ways."

So overall, in 2017, we are incredibly excited about the lineup. I think, over time, what we've seen is that entertainment is stretching the retail calendar, both online and at brick-and-mortar globally with more entertainment initiatives occurring but spreading the calendar to be now from the first quarter through the fourth quarter versus the older thinking of just looking at summer movies. And that's quite good for our business and good for the way we think about executing our blueprint. In the first quarter, you don't have new initiatives coming from DISNEY and Beauty and the Beast live action. There's a Wolverine movie coming that helps to continue to support the X-Men business. And then Guardians of the Galaxy, a TRANSFORMERS movie, both coming in the summer but spaced. Spider-Man movie coming, which is very exciting. That's a great brand for us, and we're looking forward to really executing that across multiple platforms. MY LITTLE PONY comes in the fall in October. And then you have Thor. And of course, then you have Ep 8 -- Episode 8 -- sorry, STAR WARS Episode 8 in December, so a great spread of entertainment. And then combine that with our television efforts across multiple platforms, and then the Walt Disney Company with its television efforts across Spider-Man, Avengers and Guardians. We have a very robust lineup for 2017 that we're very excited about, both from Hasbro having 2 animated films and multiple TV series as well as our partners. And I think we're well positioned coming into 2017."

We saw a strong growth in Brazil, although the market was a little more flattish in Brazil. And we saw strong growth in China. The impact in the Asia Pacific POS, as I noted, was really an Australian issue with a retailer that we're working through. But our market share in Australia has also grown despite that short-term issue. In China, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth. The teams are really executing around the blueprint. If you go to stores in China, what you see is our brands coming to life between consumer products as well as our toys and games, our entertainment on the air there. As well obviously, our movies are incredibly important. And TRANSFORMERS, as you know, is one of the most well-known brands in China and beloved. And it's an area for us of significant opportunity for long-term growth between that and several of our other brands that we've launched across Franchise and Partner Brands. In Brazil, we've seen great growth. In fact, in Brazil, we enjoyed the position of #1 doll line right now with BABY ALIVE. It's a category where the baby doll business particularly is strong. We've seen overall global growth for BABY ALIVE. But Brazil is particularly a baby doll market. And if you think about turns of inventory, clearly, underlying turns of inventory and our business is growing. When you add new initiatives, you need to provide inventory to satisfy the demand for those new initiatives and not cannibalize those to the rest of your business because these are additive opportunities. And we're seeing great acceleration in POS for those new initiatives, be it DISNEY PRINCESS or FROZEN. And then in the next several weeks, we'll see Trolls movie hit theaters around the world. And of course, we're lining up for the Trolls business across a multitude of categories and segments, and very excited about that. YO-KAI WATCH, as I noted, was some additional inventory that is already paying dividends in that the takeaway, particularly in some international markets where we have great TV placement, is doing quite well. So our turns of inventory and our management of inventory continues to improve. We continue to get leverage in our business over time and make improvements in operating margins over time as a company. And that's our objective over time is to grow operating profit faster than revenues, and we've done that in the quarter, and we intend to continue to do that."

And obviously, that has an impact in the early days on operating margin given that we are building our economy of scale and expertise and investment in that area.

The Hasbro team delivered a tremendous third quarter, the highest revenue and earnings quarter in Hasbro's history. Revenues grew 14% behind innovative products and engaging storytelling, increasing across all major operating segments and geographies. 
Operating profit increased faster than revenues, up 19%, and we continued investing to profitably grow for years to come. Our financial position is strong, and we returned $112 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. 
As we develop Hasbro into a global play and entertainment company, we have built robust brand-building capabilities, including storytelling, that supports an expansive brand portfolio. 
Today, we're garnering a greater share of life than ever before by reaching broader demographics, play experiences and geographies. Our innovation marketing and investments are informed by the global consumer insights we are uncovering as we engage with consumers and audiences across touchpoints and mediums. The investments we have made in our digital expertise enable our global teams to develop immersive brand experiences, which in turn elevate our connection with consumers and fans. 
This has far-reaching implications in how we develop brands, engage with consumers, tell stories and spend our marketing dollars. Our digital expertise is differentiating our brands. Thus far, in 2016, videos Hasbro curated or created, along with user-generated content, garnered nearly 5 billion views. 
Third quarter revenues grew at a double-digit pace in both the U.S. and Canada and International segments. Developed economies, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., France and Italy each grew revenues double digits. Emerging markets increased 16% with strong growth in Latin America, including Brazil, as well as in Asia, including China. The industry also continued to grow, up 6% through August, according to industry and company estimates. And Hasbro is gaining share. Importantly, we gained share in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia as well as developed economies, including the U.S., U.K., Spain, Italy and Australia. 
Global point of sale increased slightly in the quarter, overcoming difficult entertainment comparisons at retail, including a later set date for STAR WARS this year and post movie declines for JURASSIC WORLD. 
Girls and Games POS increased, while Boys and Preschool declined. We are seeing strong POS as we start the fourth quarter. 
In respect to Hasbro's third quarter revenues, Hasbro Franchise Brands increased 2%. This growth was led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF, TRANSFORMERS and PLAY-DOH. NERF grew for the 15th consecutive quarter, while PLAY-DOH extended its growth streak to 20 straight quarters. In addition, TRANSFORMERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues increased. 
TRANSFORMERS: ROBOTS IN disguise animation as well as streaming content from Machinima is supporting product lines which have strong initial consumer reaction. Importantly, TRANSFORMERS has good momentum heading into 2017, which marks the first of 3 years with planned major theatrical entertainment. 
We have momentum in our gaming portfolio, with growth in several brands driving the 13% increase in the category. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUEL MASTERS, PIE FACE, SIMON and BOP-IT were among the brands posting positive gains. 
Despite most of MAGIC's revenue not being included in our POS reports, POS for the Games category grew. Hasbro's gaming portfolio is unmatched, and we are cultivating gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms, including face-to-face gaming, off-the-board gaming and digital gaming experiences, notably in mobile. 
One of our newest Games, SPEAK OUT, has generated more than 100 million online views. Consumer takeaway has been extremely strong, and we are working to catch up to demand. 
Within our mobile gaming portfolio, Backflip Studios is scheduled to unveil an all new mobile game, DRAGONVALE WORLD, during the fourth quarter. This marks the first major release for this gaming property since Hasbro took a 70% stake in the studio. 
Backflip has also unveiled several new mobile games this year based on Hasbro brands, including TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS and just last week, MY LITTLE PONY: PUZZLE PARTY. 
The MY LITTLE PONY franchise continued to drive brand awareness through the strategic use of entertainment, pop-culture events and consumer products expansion. In a very competitive small-ball segment, our holiday items and new launches are beginning to drive POS gains in many markets around the world. In 2017, the MY LITTLE PONY movie will bring global audiences to all new worlds with both the core cast of characters along with all new characters. 
In addition to our Franchise Brand and Gaming portfolio, innovative new offerings at a variety of price points delivered growth for BABY ALIVE, FURBY and FURREAL FRIENDS. 
Within our Partner Brands' portfolio, revenues increased 19%, driven by positive contributions from Hasbro's shipments of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and YO-KAI WATCH. For the full year, we now expect Partner Brand revenues to approach 30% of total Hasbro revenue. Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN is off to a strong start behind a favorable reception to our core shimmer fashion doll assortment. 
Overall, the brands are ahead of our plans for the year, and we recently expanded our offering with new holiday items as well as new items in support of entertainment for Elena of Avalor and MOANA. 
STAR WARS continues to be a top global property with strong consumer and retail support around the world. ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY product was on shelf September 30, which was several weeks later than last year's on-shelf date of September 4. This shift most notably impacted our U.S. POS results. Our expectation remains that our 2016 STAR WARS revenue may match the level we achieved in 2015. 
In addition, YO-KAI WATCH and DREAMWORKS' TROLLS contributed to our Partner Brand portfolio gains this quarter. YO-KAI WATCH is now available in global markets, including strong initial performances in several countries. Our DREAMWORKS' TROLLS line hits shelves in the third quarter. Working closely with DreamWorks throughout the development of the movie, we have a robust offering of dolls, plush, games and more in support of the global movie premieres over the next several weeks. 
In closing, we've made great strides throughout 2016, including the third quarter, which historically is the largest revenue quarter of our year. Hasbro and our retailers are well positioned to deliver on what we expect to be a strong holiday season for Hasbro brands. Our initiatives are resonating with consumers, and we have good retailer support. 
In addition, inventory available at retail and at Hasbro is improved from this time last year. We are very well positioned heading into 2017 when the entertainment lineup from Hasbro and our partners is among the best we have ever experienced. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,318900558,1056103,"Hasbro Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2016",2016-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter result highlighted the strength of Hasbro's business across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top",1339,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter result highlighted the strength of Hasbro's business across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top and bottom line, and we're set for a strong finish to the year. 
14% quarterly revenue growth drove a 19% increase in quarterly operating profit. We grew margins while investing in our business, in innovation across our brand portfolio, in storytelling across mediums, in our consumer product global talent and in digital expertise, including projects for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and new gaming launches at Backflip Studios. 
Over the trailing 12-month period, we generated $637 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with $830 million in cash on our balance sheet. 
As we look to the full year, we have good momentum in our brands, including our new line supporting DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN. 
In addition, we're supporting more motion pictures in the fourth quarter than last year. We have the right inventory in the right places, both at retail and in our warehouses to support this momentum. 
For the third quarter 2016, we grew revenues in each major operating segment. In the U.S. and Canada segment, revenues increased 16%. Revenue growth in the Games and Girls categories more than offset declines in the Boys and Preschool categories. Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues grew 2% with growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF and TRANSFORMERS. 
Partner Brand revenues increased 13% in the segment, behind contributions from Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and to a lesser extent, YO-KAI WATCH. 
Additional Hasbro brands, including BABY ALIVE, EASY BAKE, PIE FACE and FURBY also contributed to the year-over-year growth for the segment. 
U.S. point of sale declined slightly in the quarter, given difficult comparisons to JURASSIC WORLD and a shift in timing for STAR WARS on-shelf dates versus last year. POS increased in the mid-teens for the first 3 quarters and is positive to start the fourth quarter. 
Retail inventory continued to be a very good quality and has grown primarily from the addition of new initiatives. 
Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 22% to $228 million or 24.4% of net revenues. Similar to prior quarters this year, higher revenues drove improved expense leverage. 
International segment revenues grew 13%, including a negative $3 million impact from foreign exchange. Within the International segment, the Boys, Girls and Preschool categories grew while the Games category was flat. 
Franchise Brand revenues increased 4% with growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, NERF and TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues increased 30% behind Hasbro shipments of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN, YO-KAI WATCH and DREAMWORKS' TROLLS. Hasbro brands BABY ALIVE and PIE FACE also contributed to the segment's strong performance. Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $133.1 million or 19.3% of net revenues. 
The International segment continued to generate greater expense leverage. Through the first 9 months of the year, currency is negatively impacted revenues by $49.1 million. Based on current economic trends, we anticipate a potential further impact of up to approximately $25 million for the remainder of the year. Despite an improved currency translation outlook from where we began the year, the impact from currency varies by market, and our global teams continue to manage the ongoing economic impact on retailers and consumers from currency devaluations in several markets around the world. 
Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 8% behind revenue growth in consumer product licensing and digital gaming. Segment operating profit decreased $2.2 million or 13% to $14.1 million or 25.1% of net revenues. 
Higher revenues and lower program production amortization were partially offset by investments in building our consumer products team globally and higher expenses at Backflip Studios in support of new gaming launches. Boulder Media revenue and expenses are being recorded in the segment and were not material in the quarter. 
Overall, operating profit increased 19%, and operating profit margin gained 100 basis points versus last year. Double-digit revenue growth drove improved expense leverage for the quarter as well as year-to-date. For the full year, we anticipate operating margin in line with or up slightly from last year. 
Cost of sales in the third quarter declined slightly as a percentage of sales and continues to benefit from growth in Partner Brands. This growth in Partner Brand revenue also led to an increase in royalties, which, at 8% of revenues, is up 30 basis points year-over-year. We now expect royalties for the full year to be in the range of our year-to-date level of 8.1% of revenues and last year's level of 8.5%. 
Program production cost amortization declined in the quarter and is running lower in 2016 than last year as we have delivered and our amortizing fewer television programs. 
Content development and storytelling remain core to our strategic investments, and we've spent $36 million in cash on television and film production over the first 9 months of the year. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we acquired Boulder Media to enhance our animation and storytelling expertise. 
SD&A as a percentage of sales was up slightly versus last year. The increase reflected higher spending on digital programs, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and BACKFLIP. Compensation expense increased during the quarter and we anticipate will increase further in the fourth quarter as we true up 2 years of successful performance on long-term plans versus measures we set several years ago. 
Turning to our results below operating profit. Other income was $8.5 million versus $5.1 million last year. The improvement resulted from a small foreign currency translation gain this year versus a loss last year and, to a lesser extent, higher interest income and growth in earnings from our share of the Discovery Family Channel. 
On a reported basis, the third quarter of 2015 included a $6.8 million gain from the sale of 2 manufacturing facilities. 
Absent the gain, other expense was $1.7 million last year. 
The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.2% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. Diluted earnings per share was $2.03 compared to EPS of $1.64 last year. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. Strong cash generation enabled us not only to invest in growing Hasbro but also to return cash to our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $112.4 million to shareholders, $64 million in dividends and $48.4 million in share repurchases. We've spent $106 million in share repurchases through the first 3 quarters of 2016. This is in line with our full year target of repurchasing $100 million to $150 million, which, as always, is subject to market conditions. 
Receivables at quarter-end increased 5% versus the 14% revenue growth, and DSOs decreased 7 days to 78 days. Our accounts receivable remain in good condition and collections continue to be strong. 
Inventories increased 36% versus last year. The overall quality of this inventory is good, and our inventory availability has improved from this point last year. More than $100 million of the year-over-year increase is in DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN; YO-KAI WATCH and Trolls, which are all new lines for Hasbro; and for PIE FACE, which is a much bigger business this year than last. 
We're also supporting multiple films in the fourth quarter, including ROGUE ONE. The later on-shelf date and our better inventory availability for this line resulted in Hasbro having more inventory on our books at quarter-end than last year. At year-end, we believe we will have the appropriate inventory to support our lines as well as new initiatives occurring early in 2017, including DISNEY'S live-action, Beauty and the Beast film. 
Finally, our retail inventories have grown in support of the successful new initiatives in growing Hasbro brands. 
In closing, we have the right brands, the right assets and the right teams to deliver a successful year. And we remain committed to taking the right strategic steps to position Hasbro for 2017 and beyond.

I appreciate the $100 million of incremental brands that you didn't have last year, but even excluding that, the inventory balance was still up into the teens. So can you maybe explain a little bit of where that inventory is basket-ed and where we should look for that inventory to progress here over the next kind of 90 to 120 days? And then just secondly, your operating profit in the U.S. -- or in the North American segment was very, very strong. I'm wondering if that's something that we should look for going forward to continue to be strong? Or if there was something unique in the quarter that allowed you to really stretch up into the mid-20s?"

Well, why don't I take the inventory question and then maybe Brian can talk about operating profit in the U.S. But from an inventory standpoint, our inventory is up. If you recall at the end of the third quarter last year, we were chasing some product, and we had only begun to start introducing the -- or building to introduce PIE FACE a little bit later in the year. So about half of the increase in our inventory is in -- it sits in our International segments, where, believe it or not, at the end of the quarter, we had positive -- we had an increase because of FX, just the way the rates landed at the end of the quarter versus throughout the whole period. So the remainder of the inventory, we -- the $100 million of increase really was due to new lines. The additional piece is due to being in a better position for some of the things that are doing very well this year, like NERF and PLAY-DOH. In addition, we have STAR WARS inventory, which was for Rogue One launch happened at September 30, which was at -- first Friday was September 4 a year ago. So overall, this just contributed to having a bit more inventory and place at the end of the quarter but at a lower percentage increase than I think what we saw at the end of the second quarter, and as we look to year-end, we will be in a good position. We do expect inventory to be up but not by as much at the end of the year as we have some great new launches coming in the first quarter of 2017, including DISNEY'S live-action Beauty and the Beast, which happens early in the quarter. So we do expect to see inventory up but at a lower rate."

We are, in fact, seeing really strong POS trends entering the fourth quarter, particularly in the U.S. We saw a little bit of softness in POS in the late summer, July/August period. And then in September, given the shift in STAR WARS as well as the impact from Jurassic, that impacted our U.S. POS. Internationally, we're seeing very strong POS up double digits in Europe, up in Latin America, up year-to-date in Asia Pacific. And then in the quarter in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, recently, we've seen some retail issues with a retailer where there was just less inventory taken and a little bit less of a sell-through and, therefore, impacted that happen [ph] number, the Asia Pacific number because of Australia. So overall, we feel very good about the POS trends year-to-date and the POS trends going into fourth quarter with a little bit of a note in the third quarter due to some of those timing shifts in some of the brands that have come down significantly versus year ago. As we think about DISNEY PRINCESS, it's performing incredibly strongly, and it's ahead of our original plan for the year. Our global teams, in partnership with DISNEY, are doing an excellent job. And in fact, we're seeing great growth from areas like our Royal Shimmer fashion dolls, that's the all 11 princesses, not even including Anna and Elsa. For the holidays, we have a big presence coming for the Royal Dreams fashion doll castle, so we even give girls great places to play with their dolls. Deb mentioned some of the entertainment but also note that in 2017 in the first quarter, we'll have the broadcast premiere of FROZEN. We'll have a holiday special next year from FROZEN. We also have Elena of Avalor, which is off to a very strong start as a television initiative. And then we're also very excited about the launch of MOANA. So all of those elements leading to a very strong Princess business. And we've made great strides and making great progress there toward our long-term objective of growing that business far beyond where it had been in the past."

So as Deb noted, it means that the inventory for that initiative was on our books at the end of the third quarter. It wasn't yet really out at retail as significantly it was a year ago. So therefore, you didn't have that the rate of sell-through on POS. And so you saw that reflected in our third quarter POS, particularly in the U.S. business. Internationally, you didn't see quite the same impact. So overall, I would say a couple of things. First, STAR WARS year-to-date sales, revenues, are up significantly through the third quarter. So as we look at the full year, we look at International POS. And the POS we're seeing coming into the fourth quarter, now that we have inventory, we, again, reiterate our belief that 2015 levels could equal 2016 levels for the STAR WARS brand."

So this year, we've done a better job across the company, particularly in our U.S. business, to ensure we had inventories of great initiatives that were selling at a high rate. So our retail inventories are up but up around the brands that are selling quite well, and so we're in support of those. Our percent in stocks have improved year-on-year. That's something that we care about. We want to make our shelf spaces productive as possible in partnership with our retailers. But equally importantly, we are seeing significant increases in online sales. And those online sales are severalfold higher than our overall sales. And we're also seeing online sales increases across every one of our categories. And this is U.S. data, where whether it's Boys, Girls, Preschool or Games, we're seeing significant online sales increases. So where we are able to provide our product lines and our brands directly to the consumer via our retail partners online, we are seeing great takeaway and our brands are really resonating. So that also for us is a great bellwether for how consumers are responding to our products and brands."

We're doing a better job in placing our content around the continent and getting our content played with major broadcasters. We have around the world, so this includes Europe as well as other global players, more than 50 SVOD platforms that are now playing our content.

If you look at the mix, it's a bit more mixed toward lower-priced product. And that has to do with the fact that there's some lower-price SKUs from prior product inventory that are still selling through in the third quarter. So overall, we're seeing growth in our business. And we're seeing like-for-like stronger takeaway for our products, but we're also seeing stronger takeaway into the third quarter for lower-priced products that will be eliminated over the next quarter or 2. We're seeing great takeaway in the fashion dolls -- offering all 11 fashion dolls. We're seeing great early takeaway from Elena of Avalor. So again, overall, PRINCESS and FROZEN performing well. And FROZEN, what's great is that the brand is performing, for us, at quite a strong level. And FROZEN has even more of an international footprint than the PRINCESS business on a percentage basis, so more countries around the world are really focusing in on FROZEN with great results globally. And you see that indicated in some of our POS data as FROZEN tend -- is tending to be slightly more internationally oriented on percentage terms. Obviously, we're benefiting from a great campaign that's began this fall called Dream Big PRINCESS in partnership with the DISNEY company. And of course, we're very much looking forward to all of the new entertainment coming next year, the broadcast debut of FROZEN, the FROZEN holiday special. First quarter, seeing a Beauty and the Beast live-action movie, Elena of Avalor on television and, of course, MOANA coming in the next few weeks."

So if you look at the Boys business in the quarter, the biggest decline both for Boys and for our company in the quarter was Jurassic. That's the impact that it had. In the quarter, MARVEL is up a bit in the Boys business. Our action figure business is performing at quite a high level. We had -- it was a strong contributor to the quarter. We had great partnership on a Superhero Spectacular Retail program with DISNEY and with MARVEL. Our MARVEL Legends business is performing quite well. Spider-Man is also performing quite strongly, which is a great lead into next year's movie. And so that's what we're seeing. We're also have got a lot of fan-oriented product. It's one of the brands that's responding the most to our fan orientation and fanning the flames of our fans and providing product to them that they really like and offering that online. And you'll see some products for fans around Dr. Strange. As you go forward, NERF is growing dramatically for both the quarter as well as year-to-date. STAR WARS, as I said, year-to-date is up significantly, down in the quarter. And TRANSFORMERS is up. As I noted, TRANSFORMERS is up pretty substantially in the quarter, and it has to do with the fact that we continue to improve the blueprint and add elements to the blueprint this quarter with the Machinima content running, the Combiner Wars and that product performing at quite a strong level. So TRANSFORMERS business is doing well. We also add to that the Backflip Studios, TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS, which is all around Combiner Wars. So again, executing that blueprint. We even had fan-created product in the quarter, which is a Combiner called Victorion created by fans. We're allowing fans to curate, along with the content that we're streaming, so 3 types of content. It's a strong lead-in to our 2017 plans for TRANSFORMERS. In addition, I forgot to mention, but in MARVEL, we have very strong plans leading to next year in 2017, obviously, with Guardians of the Galaxy, with the Spider-Man movie and a Thor movie. So it's a -- we're in a good position on the MARVEL Boys business overall. And then of course, a new initiative that's working particularly well in early days internationally is YO-KAI WATCH. We've just started to launch in international markets, and we're seeing some great takeaway there. So overall, there's -- they're kind of our Boys lineup. And as I've said on STAR WARS, to repeat, we do expect that STAR WARS could equal STAR WARS levels of 2015 across the company."

You're going to see, in 2017, 2 Hasbro films, so certainly TRANSFORMERS. You're also going to see a MY LITTLE PONY animated feature in the fall. The opportunity in TRANSFORMERS is to take the storytelling into movies for multiple years, and you'll see that in '17, '18 and '19 with different kinds of stories being told. So not every movie will be the same, but every movie continues to add to the character and story of the property. And when we first started, our objective was always to build the brand enterprise value through the blueprint. And so this is the next logical step. I took a step back as we came into the third quarter call just to give a perspective on our Franchise Brands and brands like TRANSFORMERS. So I looked at Franchise Brands as we were sitting here at the end of the third quarter 2013 and take it today, year-to-date versus year-to-date, '13 versus '16, our Franchise Brands are up 33%. And that's the view we take to our business is that longer view of building brands over time, adding elements to our blueprint, adding capabilities and taking our brands over time to the next level. So that's indicative of the way that we think about Franchise Brands. So TRANSFORMERS steps up. MY LITTLE PONY steps up for next year.

And that's quite good for our business and good for the way we think about executing our blueprint. In the first quarter, you don't have new initiatives coming from DISNEY and Beauty and the Beast live action. There's a Wolverine movie coming that helps to continue to support the X-Men business. And then Guardians of the Galaxy, a TRANSFORMERS movie, both coming in the summer but spaced. Spider-Man movie coming, which is very exciting. That's a great brand for us, and we're looking forward to really executing that across multiple platforms. MY LITTLE PONY comes in the fall in October. And then you have Thor. And of course, then you have Ep 8 -- Episode 8 -- sorry, STAR WARS Episode 8 in December, so a great spread of entertainment.

The impact in the Asia Pacific POS, as I noted, was really an Australian issue with a retailer that we're working through. But our market share in Australia has also grown despite that short-term issue. In China, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth. The teams are really executing around the blueprint. If you go to stores in China, what you see is our brands coming to life between consumer products as well as our toys and games, our entertainment on the air there. As well obviously, our movies are incredibly important. And TRANSFORMERS, as you know, is one of the most well-known brands in China and beloved. And it's an area for us of significant opportunity for long-term growth between that and several of our other brands that we've launched across Franchise and Partner Brands. In Brazil, we've seen great growth. In fact, in Brazil, we enjoyed the position of #1 doll line right now with BABY ALIVE. It's a category where the baby doll business particularly is strong. We've seen overall global growth for BABY ALIVE. But Brazil is particularly a baby doll market. And if you think about turns of inventory, clearly, underlying turns of inventory and our business is growing. When you add new initiatives, you need to provide inventory to satisfy the demand for those new initiatives and not cannibalize those to the rest of your business because these are additive opportunities. And we're seeing great acceleration in POS for those new initiatives, be it DISNEY PRINCESS or FROZEN. And then in the next several weeks, we'll see Trolls movie hit theaters around the world. And of course, we're lining up for the Trolls business across a multitude of categories and segments, and very excited about that. YO-KAI WATCH, as I noted, was some additional inventory that is already paying dividends in that the takeaway, particularly in some international markets where we have great TV placement, is doing quite well. So our turns of inventory and our management of inventory continues to improve. We continue to get leverage in our business over time and make improvements in operating margins over time as a company.

Even with your revised royalty guidance, it would imply that 4Q royalty would be down year-over-year despite potentially supporting more movie franchises in 4Q. Could you maybe help me understand some of the moving pieces there?"

So again, we're not suggesting that Partner Brands going to continue to grow over time beyond the range that they're in. I think they're up a bit versus what we'd said earlier. We thought they might come in around 25% over time. And over time, I would believe, around 25%, 27% is about right. They're a bit heavier in this year given the number of new initiatives what we're launching for the first time, particularly PRINCESS and FROZEN. And obviously, that has an impact in the early days on operating margin given that we are building our economy of scale and expertise and investment in that area. And that we do believe, over time, the operating margin for PRINCESS approaches run rate operating margin for our Partner Brands. We've made great progress there. We're ahead of where we thought we'd be this time in the year. But we still have a long way to go toward the opportunity to grow that business over time."

EASY BAKE was up in the quarter. FURREAL FRIENDS was up in the quarter. And those brands are all up as well year-to-date, so our teams who are working on our Challenger Brands are doing quite a good job in identifying, creating lighthouse identities. As we normally would say, we don't really comment on M&A overall. We continue to look at our brand portfolio. We own about 1,500 brand names. And we look at brands that have the greatest global potential enterprise value. And over time, we may identify brands as we have that are licensed out to other parties. For example, Tonka is licensed out to another party, and we receive royalty income, but we're not receiving revenues. So over time, the team may look at different strategic optionality for some of those brands."
