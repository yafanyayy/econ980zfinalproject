Thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Our second quarter and first half results are largely in line with our expectations for how fiscal '16 would've unfold. While Q2 revenue was a bit weaker than expected, we anticipate operating within the",1406,"Okay. Thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Our second quarter and first half results are largely in line with our expectations for how fiscal '16 would've unfold. While Q2 revenue was a bit weaker than expected, we anticipate operating within the continuing soft revenue environment, with Q2 being the weakest of the year relative to prior year results due to the budget process and a difficult compare in the legacy Exelis business. And as we previously communicated, our #1 priority this year would be integrating Exelis and realizing the synergy savings and earnings accretion we promised and we're executing well against that goal. We're also delivering on our commitment to maximize free cash flow to quickly delever and to dispassionately evaluate portfolio reshaping as today's announcements and results will demonstrate. 
Second quarter earnings were solid, and free cash flow was particularly strong, and again, this quarter, we made excellent progress in achieving integration savings. We've also identified the additional opportunities and now expect to reach run rate savings exiting fiscal '17 of $140 million to $150 million, significantly higher than the $120 million we previously communicated. First half free cash flow was supporting our deleveraging priority, reducing term loan debt $200 million in the quarter and $383 million since closing the transaction in late May. 
We're also pleased to report being far down the path of divesting the aerostructures business, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and was determined to not be strategic to Harris. Aerostructures is currently reported within the electronic system segment and had calendar '15 revenue of $77 million. After receiving considerable interest from potential buyers, we are narrowing the group to a select few and expect to reach a definitive agreement soon. 
We'll also continue to evaluate our now much broader portfolio with the dispassionate view towards which businesses are strategically aligned and which are not. We also continue to adapt to market conditions and adjust our cost structure accordingly as we have in the past. In the second quarter, due to the prolonged downturn in CapRock's energy market, we took a noncash write-down of goodwill and other assets, and we launched restructuring and other actions that were primarily in CapRock. Our goal is to rightsize the business in line with market conditions, and these latest actions reduce their headcount by about 20%. When combined with steps we took in Q4 last year, headcount at CapRock will be down about 35% over the last 18 months. Altogether, these actions are expected to generate modest savings in fiscal '16 and about $20 million to $25 million in fiscal '17. 
So let me turn quickly to quarterly results in Slide 3 in the presentation, and I remind you that our discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per share was $1.49, with acquisition savings supporting operating performance in a still relatively soft revenue environment, with the recently reenacted R&D tax credit contributing $0.10 per share. Reported revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.21 billion in the prior year. In an organic basis, while we anticipate in a difficult year-over-year revenue compare, it was a little weaker than expected at down 14%, so let me give you a little more color on the drivers. About 4 to 5 points of the decline related to Exelis overdrive in their Q4 '14 results, Government IT Services contributed another 5 points, which as we mentioned before would be impacted by the wind-down of a couple of large contracts in a still slow procurement environment, and CapRock with another point or so with the remaining business contributing about 3 points. 
On the positive side, Harris legacy international tactical revenue was up a strong 10% in the quarter, resulting in Harris total legacy tactical revenue at about flat with the prior year and about as expected for the quarter. Revenue was also higher in geospatial imagery, driven by the continued ramp of our large classified foundation, geo and content management program, and was also higher with the FAA, driven by NextGen modernization programs. On a sequential basis for the company, revenue was up 2% with all segments higher except Critical Networks, which includes IT Services and CapRock. 
Orders in the quarter were $1.5 billion, and together with strong orders booked in Q1, first half book-to-bill with just over 1. In IT Services, although revenue was down in the quarter, orders were encouraging, driving a book-to-bill of 1.1 for the quarter in the first half. And we expect first half orders, combined with incumbent positions on existing programs, will support back half revenue stability. 
In CapRock, our strategy to diversify our business into the cruise market where bandwidth demand is growing is helping to offset a bit of the energy revenue weakness. Over the last 2 years, bandwidth demand on cruise ships has increased exponentially from an average of less than 5 megabits per ship to now 35 megabits with 1 gigabit in sight for the largest vessels. And it's important to note that our position in the cruise market is solid, with 2.5 years left on our 5-year agreement with Carnival and another 5 years left with Royal Caribbean following a contract extension that was awarded in the quarter. Perhaps as important, diversification brings a significant volume leverage for purchasing satellite bandwidth, and our scale has allowed us to consolidate bandwidth, drive down cost and implement a sales approach of one price over one global system regardless of market to further drive efficiency gains in the organization. 
In Tactical Communications, we previously highlighted U.S. funding support for foreign military sales from both the base budget as well as from accounts for special initiatives such as the European Reassurance Initiative, the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund for Middle East and Africa, and the Iraq Train and Equip Fund or ITEF. The funding supports our strong 1Q bookings, and in 2Q, we booked $66 million in orders supported by ITEF. We ended the first half of the year with an international tactical book-to-bill of 0.99. On the U.S. tactical front, progress continues to be made on Army modernization, and we were encouraged that the Army requested best and final offers from all bidders for the 2-channel Manpack radio and reconfirm to their calendar Q1 award date. 
In Public Safety, orders were up more than 30% on a weak prior year compare, with book-to-bill greater than 1 on a fairly good revenue level of $109 million. Orders included $20 million from Arizona Public services, the state's largest electrical utility company; and $18 million from the International Guard that includes our latest product offering, the multiband XL 200P radio. While we're still not satisfied with our Public Safety results, we've expressed multiple times that improving performance in the business will come as a result of solving basic execution challenges, introducing new products, improving quality, strengthening front line and program management capabilities, and we're beginning to see positive signs that the business is slowly turning the corner. 
In space and Intel, on top of strong Q1 wins from classified customers, we received healthy orders of $172 million and another $23 million contract to support space superiority missions. Space superiority and protection has become a U.S. defense priority and is expected to receive $8 billion in funding over the next 5 years. Our first half win in space superiority, combined with the strong funding support, should make this an area of solid growth for the company into the future. 
And following the close of the quarter, the space and Intel segment was awarded a $316 million follow-on contract for NASA for the cross-track infrared sounder or CRISP payloads on the third and fourth weather satellites for the Joint Polar Satellite System. These payloads provide key global data used by the National Weather Service, and for Harris, the award continues the strong customer relationship we enjoy with NASA and with NOA. And then just recently in Critical Networks, we were awarded a 9-year, $44 million contract from U.K. navigation service provider called NATS to modernize their voice communications infrastructure. This represents our first international win in this area and results from leveraging technology provided under the FAA's NextGen modernization program to now address the global market. 
So with the successful integration of Excelis as our #1 focus for the company, I've asked Sheldon to join us again this quarter to provide a little more detail in integration and any additional opportunities the team has identified. Sheldon?"

Again, this quarter, we made excellent progress in achieving integration savings and have identified several new opportunities. The team quickly developed plans to capture these additional savings, and we're pleased to report that 100% of our cost-saving projects are either complete or in progress. As Bill noted earlier, we now expect net run rate savings to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million as we exit fiscal '17, up significantly from our previous estimate of $120 million. Associated with this, we now expect wrote integration cost of $250 million and net cost of $200 million after government reimbursements. Additional savings are primarily in 2 areas: rationalization and supply chain. 
In the Q1 call, we highlighted the SINCGARS tactical radio manufacturing operations from Fort Wayne to Rochester. And just last week, we completed production for our very first SINCGARS radio assembly in our Rochester state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. With this project well underway, we've launched new facilities consolidation projects in 5 locations that will reduce footprint by an additional 230,000 square feet, bringing total company's square footage reduction related to the acquisition down 15% since closing. 
The second area of additional savings comes from a thorough review of our supply chain. We've spent a lot of time building the database to what Exelis buys to what Harris buys and what each pays on price, down to the individual part number to understand our supply chain spending across the combined company. With this database in place, we launched multiple projects across a broad range of spend categories from electronic components to company travel to eliminate price disparity and leverage our much larger volume to reduce costs. We also launched should-cause analyses and value-engineering initiatives to further drive supply chain savings. A quick example is the should-cause analysis that identified a 20% reduction in the price of a key component used across our night vision product line. We see a lot of opportunities like these, which will add to our pipeline of regular annual operational excellence projects. And while not highlighted on the page, an underlying core theme of our integration is to reduce complexity throughout the company, and we're using this opportunity to take the best of both companies' approach to simplify and standardize across the new Harris. We've already reduce the number of health plans by 50%, corporate policies by 40% and legal entities by 12%. And we're targeting a 50% reduction in core IT applications and an even greater reduction in the number of data centers. So as we enter the back half of the first year of integration, we're excited about the progress so far and confident that driving standardization and simplification across the business will build a solid foundation for the future. 
And with that, I'll turn over to  Mick to discuss segment results."
177934,322511693,924467,"Harris Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sheldon, and good morning to everyone.

Before turning to each segment, we'll provide some color around the onetime items in the quarter that are excluded from our non-GAAP results and also point you to GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on Slide 5. 
Unrelated to the acquisition, we had a $367 million noncash charge to write down goodwill and other assets in the CapRock business as a result of the prolonged downturn in the energy market. Acquisition-related items included a $101 million benefit for a net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefit plans, $43 million of integration cost and a $3 million charge related to inventory step-up. We also had restructuring and other charges totaling $35 million, with the majority for workforce and facility reductions. 
So turning now to segment detail on Slide 6 and comparisons to prior year pro forma results as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. Communication Systems' segment revenue was $489 million compared to prior year pro forma of $539 million. Tactical Communications revenue was down 10%, declining primarily due to weakness in Exelis legacy, tactical and night vision product lines. Harris legacy Tactical Communications was about flat as a result of strength in international. 
Public Safety revenue was $109 million compared to $116 million in the prior year, declining year-over-year but up 18% sequentially quarter-to-quarter. Operating income in the second quarter was $138 million, and operating margin was 28.2% compared to last year's operating income of $144 million and 26.7% margin. 
Turning to space and intelligence systems on Slide 7. Second quarter revenue was $446 million compared to prior year pro forma of $488 million. Higher revenue from 2 classified programs, including the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program was more than offset by the completion of other classified programs and lower GPS3 revenue. Operating income in the second quarter was $67 million, and operating margin was 15% compared to last year's operating income of $87 million and 17.8% margin. 
Turning to electronic systems on Slide 8. Second quarter revenue was $382 million compared to prior year pro forma of $451 million. Higher revenue from the ramp in F-35 production was more than offset by lower electronic warfare revenue. Operating income in the second quarter was $69 million, and operating margin was 18.1% compared to last year's operating income of $78 million and 17.3% margin. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 9. Second quarter revenue was $541 million compared to prior year pro forma of $672 million. Lower revenue and IT Services in CapRock's energy market was partially offset by higher FAA revenue, driven by NextGen modernization programs. Operating income in the second quarter was $71 million, and operating margin was 13.1% compared to last year's operating income of $83 million and 12.4% margin. 
So let me turn it back to Bill for the guidance discussion and a few wrapup comments."

Revenue guidance on an organic basis as revised from down 3% to 5% to now down 5% to 6%. We expect the impact of lower volume on earnings to be more than offset by the flow-through of the R&D tax credit and cost savings across the company. As a result, non-GAAP EPS guidance has been increased to a range of $5.70 to $5.80. And to remind you, non-GAAP includes intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition of $133 million or about $0.70 per share. 
In Communication Systems, the expectations are unchanged. In Space and Intel, operating margin expectations have been revised to a range of 15% to 15.5%, primarily to reflect the higher mix of cost plus revenue and new program starts. In electronic systems, revenue expectations have been revised to a range of down 2% to 3% due to a few losses in electronic warfare pursuits combined with a lower-than-expected ramp of previous electronic warfare wins. In Critical Networks, revenue expectations have been revised to down about 14% due to further weakness in Government IT Services and CapRock's energy market. 
So to wrap up, as I said upfront, our top priorities are successfully integrating Exelis, delivering strong free cash flow, deleveraging our balance sheet and continuing to reshape the portfolio. And through the first half of the year, we're making good progress on all of them. So while we still face top line pressure in fiscal '16, integration and other cost-reduction actions are driving good earnings growth, and we expect this rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal '17. 
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

Let me see if I could hit on some of the key things, and I'll provide you I think as much as I can on that. First thought, the -- on the book-to-bill, this is all legacy tactical radios, so go back to sort of how Harris define tactical radio. Our book-to-bill in the first half was up [ph] 0.97, so international was 0.99, as mentioned in my remarks, and DoD was a little bit less than that. A little bit softer in Q2, but we had a very strong Q1. Remember, it was about 1.3. Revenue, we believe came in about as expected in the quarter, a bit stronger in international, which as we said, up 10%, a little bit lower in the DoD. it's Flat overall in Q2 and up 3% in the first half, so I think overall, a pretty decent start. For the full year, we still state see revenue being flat to down low single digits. We still see DoD to be flat up slightly, and international be down slightly on a year-over-year basis. And it's really shaping up almost as we had expected where we initiated guidance 6 months ago: up, first half; down in the second half on a year-over-year basis. With 2 bigger tranches and to specific countries winding down, that makes for tougher comparisons in the back half. We still see sequentially the second half being up versus the first, with Europe and the Middle East both contributing pretty nicely. In fact, in this year, we think Europe is shaping up to be a record or near-record year for us, driven a lot by this ERI U.S. Government funding for Ukraine and the Baltics as well as a few other Central European, Eastern European countries. But we do see the impact of lower oil pricing that's shifting some of the priorities in some of the countries in the Middle East as well as some of the priorities of the U.S. government. So that's giving a little bit of more caution in the back half, but still we see second half up sequentially from the first. Now let me turn to the pipeline and just quickly cover that. In the international side, the pipeline is still very robust. It's now $2.9 billion. Last time, it was $2.4 billion. So it's come up as we brought in about a $600 million opportunity for Phase 3 modernization in Australia. We expect that the award at the end of fiscal '17, so that is now into our 12- to 18-month pipeline. The Middle East is still very solid. On a dollar basis, it's still about the same as it was before. On a percentage basis, down a little bit, now slightly under 50% because the size of the overall pipeline has increased, so still very, very broad. Again, Europe is strong. is holding [indiscernible] and we see Asia coming up pretty nicely, meaning because of Australia. So that's on the international front. On the DoD side the pipeline is at $890 million, so down slightly from where we were last time, about $925 million, so it was just under $900 million. The mix is still about the same, 60% Air Force, SOCOM, Marine Corps; and about 25% being Army in part modernization and part resets and other opportunities. So let me stop with that, Gautam, and see if I answer that question that you're trying to get at."

The words around that is numerically the same as we guided before to $750 million. And without getting beyond '16 guidance, we do still see 3 or 4 years out of $1 billion of free cash flow. The drivers are as we expected before. We do see the higher run rate synergies impacting that free cash flows growing from $750 million. We see interest rate reductions, interest cost reductions coming down because we're paying down some debt. We do see continued working capital performance improvements over time. Recall, we're at, as Harris, last year fiscal '15, about 46  days working capital. Exelis was quite a bit higher than that. We came in at about 56 days at the end of Q2. So just as we get back to where Harris was before, we see another 10-plus-or-minus days of improvement of working capital at about $20 million per day. So we'll close some of that this year. But even we don't close all of that, it's still to be substantial increases in cash flow just simply from capital. Of course, we also see a little bit of capital spend efficiency over time as well. So those are the major elements. Again, we're still confident about $1 billion 3 to 4 years out."

And we now in Saudi, Saudi has been a significant opportunity for us, one of the big in our pipeline, like Iraq happens to be in others throughout the Middle East. There's 5 or 6 countries that make us the biggest of international -- Middle East part of our pipeline. And we do see in Saudi, in particular, where their focus on the war in Yemen and military purchases to support that, we're seeing some of the opportunities on the radio business slip a little bit to the right both in terms of Harris as well as what was legacy Exelis. So that has slipped a little bit to the right. But overall, do I think the opportunity in the Middle East still remains out there? The pipeline size is still very good and very robust, and we're very encouraged by the fact that there's strong U.S. Government support, FMS support for opportunities in the Middle East. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we talked about this last time. The ITEF funding, that flowed from the U.S. Government is flowing in and is helping us in Q2, and we do expect to see more opportunities into the future. GFY16, it was just about $700 million worth of ITEF funding, which is Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, which includes amount for Syria, so $1.1 billion.

We typically see quarter-to-quarter some fluctuations, Seth, and you saw -- you went through some of the charts some sequential deteriorations, some business have been up or down, CN was actually quite strong on a sequential and year-over-year basis because of mix. It was a lot of FAA work that's going in there offsetting decline in services as well as in CapRock. Things are moving around a little bit. But we'll see margins continuing to improve going out into next year simply based on better volume and also the integration savings are going to continue to roll through, and we keep working hard to drive our normal OpEx agenda. So we expect that we'll see margins improving. Right now, I think we're pretty strong this year in CS. We were guiding to 29.5 to 30.5 so we're holding on that. And we do expect based on mix and the trends we're seeing in the business that we could be towards the higher end of that. The SIS business is a government contracting business. While it's a little bit weaker in terms of margin than we expect it before, it's pretty solid 15, 15.5. So I think that's very, very strong ES at 18% to 19% is a very strong margin. That will be impacted over time by some changes in the mix of the programs as we bring on newer programs and move off  of legacy ones, so we'll see some of the integration savings offset some of the mix. In CN, we're just battling right now what's happening in the CapRock business and services. The FAA work in international opportunities for mission networks or FAA-like opportunities, I think, are going to help us there. So I wouldn't want to get too far out of fiscal '16 in terms of margin guidance here, Seth, but that's where we stand right now for within the year."

We see what's happening in the DoD base budget this year and next year, so it's on an upswing at least a little bit and which I think is very positive. Now for Harris, in particular, I think we feel very good about our programs. The tactical radio lines that we typically pull from are well supported. Army modernization, we think is adequately covered. The FAA looks really good. The NextGen programs were well-funded in fiscal '16. We were pleased to see funding for GPS3, which is an important Exelis program on SV9 and 10. Weather programs were well supported, and I'm glad that you see the recent award come through very recently on the Chris payloads for GPS3 and 4. F-35, we got a pretty large content per ship set. Again, we're seeing that ramp. That was well supported. In addition, the F-18 aircraft into the budget. There were 7 or 8 aircraft. It was also good because Exelis is an EW product line for the F-18. And again, finally, OCO, we feel good about because of the amounts that are in there, which support some of the international FMS opportunities that we're going after in our tactical business.

We came into the year thinking we'd be down mid-teens, and it's now down probably in the 23%, 25% range over the course of the year. But we do see, at least sequentially, it's stabilizing quarter-to-quarter going through the back end of fiscal '16. Our book-to-bill in Q2 in the first half was reasonably good. It was over 1, of course, on a lower revenue environment, but the book-to-bill was pretty good, which again gets us encouraged that we can support some stability in the back half. We also have incumbent positions on some legacy programs that as the roll-off start to ease, I think we'll see more stability in the back half. So for the pipeline that we have, we've got a very large pipeline of opportunities that we're chasing. It's actually come up a couple of billion from the beginning of the year. It's something like $24 billion now. We have, within Harris, we've got to make sure that we improve our win rate. Our win rate is a little bit below what our target happens to be. We typically win in the 23%, 25%. It should be 30% or more, so we're not winning quite as much as we need to be. A lot of that is really around our frontline execution and our process execution, and we're getting that fixed.

We are also a mission-critical communication defense electronics-type company. So for the aerostructures business, we've got these large composite skins and large factories and lot of capital intensity. It really didn't necessarily fit with the rest of what we look like. So I think that one, as we came into the year, we're looking hard which businesses should management focus its time and attention on, on a continuum of businesses that go from very, very strategic like tactical radios on the far left to may be less strategic on the far right being aerostructures. Other businesses sit in the middle, and I'm using the criteria that I just described to assess which ones we should keep and which we should and should not. At the end of the day, does it fit strategically? Is it more valuable to us versus to somebody else? We look at performance of the company, performance of the business.

Our second quarter and first half results are largely in line with our expectations for how fiscal '16 would unfold. While Q2 revenue was a bit weaker than expected, we anticipate operating within the continuing soft revenue environment, with Q2 being the weakest of the year relative to prior year results due to the budget process and a difficult compare in the legacy Exelis business. And as we've previously communicated, our #1 priority this year would be integrating Exelis and realizing the synergy savings and earnings accretion we have promised, and we're executing well against that goal. We're also delivering on our commitment to maximize free cash flow to quickly delever and to dispassionately evaluate portfolio reshaping as today's announcements and results will demonstrate. 
Second quarter earnings were solid, and free cash flow was particularly strong. And again, this quarter, we made excellent progress in achieving integration savings. We've also identified the additional opportunities and now expect to reach run rate savings exiting fiscal '17 of $140 million to $150 million, significantly higher than the $120 million we previously communicated. First half free cash flow was supporting our deleveraging priority, reducing term loan debt $200 million in the quarter and $383 million since closing the transaction in late May. 
We're also pleased to report being far down the path of divesting the aerostructures business, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and was determined to not be strategic to Harris. Aerostructures is currently reported within the Electronic Systems segment and had calendar '15 revenue of $77 million. After receiving considerable interest from potential buyers, we are narrowing the group to a select few and expect to reach a definitive agreement soon. 
We'll also continue to evaluate our now much broader portfolio with a dispassionate view towards which businesses are strategically aligned and which are not. We also continue to adapt to market conditions and adjust our cost structure accordingly as we have in the past. In the second quarter, due to the prolonged downturn in CapRock's energy market, we took a noncash write-down of goodwill and other assets, and we launched restructuring and other actions that were primarily in CapRock. Our goal is to rightsize the business in line with market conditions, and these latest actions reduced their headcount by about 20%. When combined with steps we took in Q4 last year, headcount at CapRock will be down about 35% over the last 18 months. Altogether, these actions are expected to generate modest savings in fiscal '16 in about $20 million to $25 million in fiscal '17. 
So let me turn quickly to quarterly results in Slide 3 in the presentation, and I'll remind you that our discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per share was $1.49, with acquisition savings supporting operating performance in a still relatively soft revenue environment with the recently reenacted R&D tax credit contributing $0.10 per share. Reported revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.21 billion in the prior year. And on an organic basis, while we anticipated a difficult year-over-year revenue compare, it was a little weaker than expected at down 14%, so let me give you a little more color on the drivers. About 4 to 5 points of the decline related to Exelis overdrive in their Q4 '14 results. Government IT Services contributed another 5 points, which as we've mentioned before would be impacted by the wind-down of a couple of large contracts in a still slow procurement environment. And CapRock with another point or so, with the remaining business contributing about 3 points. 
On the positive side, Harris legacy international tactical revenue was up a strong 10% in the quarter, resulting in Harris total legacy tactical revenue at about flat with the prior year and about as expected for the quarter. Revenue was also higher in geospatial imagery, driven by the continued ramp of our large classified foundation, GEOINT Content Management program, and was also higher with the FAA, driven by NextGen modernization programs. On a sequential basis for the company, revenue was up 2% with all segments higher except Critical Networks, which includes IT Services and CapRock. 
Orders in the quarter were $1.5 billion. And together with strong orders booked in Q1, first half book-to-bill with just over 1. In IT Services, although revenue was down in the quarter, orders were encouraging, driving a book-to-bill of 1.1 for the quarter and the first half. And we expect first half orders, combined with incumbent positions on existing programs, will support back-half revenue stability. 
In CapRock, our strategy to diversify our business into the cruise market, where bandwidth demand is growing, is helping to offset a bit of the energy revenue weakness. Over the last 2 years, bandwidth demand on cruise ships has increased exponentially from an average of less than 5 megabits per ship to now 35 megabits, with 1 gigabit in sight for the largest vessels. And it's important to note that our position in the cruise market is solid, with 2.5 years left on our 5-year agreement with Carnival and another 5 years left with Royal Caribbean, following a contract extension that was awarded in the quarter. Perhaps as important, diversification brings a significant volume leverage for purchasing satellite bandwidth, and our scale has allowed us to consolidate bandwidth, drive down cost and implement a sales approach of one price over one global system, regardless of market, to further drive efficiency gains in the organization. 
In Tactical Communications, we previously highlighted U.S. funding support for foreign military sales from both the base budget as well as from OCO accounts for special initiatives, such as the European Reassurance Initiative, the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund for Middle East and Africa, and the Iraq Train and Equip Fund, or ITEF. The funding supported our strong 1Q bookings. And in 2Q, we booked $66 million in orders supported by ITEF. We ended the first half of the year with an international tactical book-to-bill of 0.99. On the U.S. tactical front, progress continues to be made on army modernization, and we were encouraged that the army requested best and final offers from all bidders for the 2-channel Manpack radio and reconfirmed their calendar Q1 award date. 
In Public Safety, orders were up more than 30% on a weak prior year compare, with book-to-bill greater than 1 on a fairly good revenue level of $109 million. Orders included $20 million from Arizona Public Services, the state's largest electrical utility company; and $18 million from the Air National Guard that includes our latest product offering, the multiband XL-200P radio. While we're still not satisfied with our Public Safety results, we've expressed multiple times that improving performance in the business will come as a result of solving basic execution challenges, introducing new products, improving quality, strengthening front line and program management capabilities, and we're beginning to see positive signs that the business is slowly turning the corner. 
In Space and Intel, on top of strong Q1 wins from classified customers, we received healthy orders of $172 million and another $23 million contract to support space superiority missions. Space superiority and protection has become a U.S. Defense priority and is expected to receive $8 billion in funding over the next 5 years. Our first half wins in space superiority, combined with the strong funding support, should make this an area of solid growth for the company into the future. 
And following the close of the quarter, the Space and Intel segment was awarded a $316 million follow-on contract for NASA for the Cross-track Infrared Sounder, or CrIS payloads, on the third and fourth weather satellites for the Joint Polar Satellite System. These payloads provide key global data used by the National Weather Service, and for Harris, the award continues the strong customer relationship we enjoy with NASA and with NOAA. 
And then just recently in Critical Networks, we were awarded a 9-year, $44 million contract from the U.K.'s inter-navigation service provider called NATS to modernize their voice communication's infrastructure. This represents our first international win in this area and results from leveraging technology provided under the FAA's NextGen modernization program to now address the global market. 
So with the successful integration of Excelis as our #1 focus for the company, I've asked Sheldon to join us again this quarter to provide a little more detail in integration and the additional opportunities the team has identified. Sheldon?"

If you turn to Slide 4. Again, this quarter, we've made excellent progress in achieving integration savings and have identified several new opportunities. The team quickly developed plans to capture these additional savings, and we're pleased to report that 100% of our cost-saving projects are either complete or in progress. As Bill noted earlier, we now expect net run rate savings to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million as we exit fiscal '17, up significantly from our previous estimate of $120 million. Associated with this, we now expect gross integration cost of $250 million and net cost of $200 million after government reimbursements. Additional savings are primarily in 2 areas: footprint rationalization and supply chain. 
In the Q1 call, we highlighted moving the SINCGARS tactical radio manufacturing operations from Fort Wayne to Rochester. And just last week, we completed production of our very first SINCGARS radio assembly in our Rochester state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. With this project well underway, we've launched new facility consolidation projects in 5 locations that will reduce footprint by an additional 230,000 square feet, bringing total company square footage reduction related to the acquisition down 15% since closing. 
The second area of additional savings comes from a thorough review of our supply chain. We've spent a lot of time building the database to compare what Exelis buys to what Harris buys and what each pays on price, down to the individual part number to understand our supply chain spending across the combined company. With this database in place, we launched multiple projects across a broad range of spend categories, from electronic components to company travel, to eliminate price disparity and leverage our much larger volume to reduce costs. We also launched should-cost analysis and value-engineering initiatives to further drive supply chain savings. A quick example is a should-cost analysis that identified a 20% reduction in the price of a key component used across our night vision product line. We see a lot of opportunities like these, which will add to our pipeline of regular annual operational excellence projects. And while not highlighted on the page, an underlying core theme of our integration is to reduce complexity throughout the company. And we're using this opportunity to take the best of both companies' approach to simplify and standardize across the new Harris. We've already reduced the number of health plans by 50%, corporate policies by 40% and legal entities by 12%. And we're targeting a 50% reduction in core IT applications and an even greater reduction in the number of data centers. So as we enter the back half of the first year of integration, we're excited about the progress so far and confident that driving standardization and simplification across the business will build a solid foundation for the future. 
And with that, I'll turn over to Mick to discuss segment results."

Before turning to each segment, we'll provide some color around the onetime items in the quarter that are excluded from our non-GAAP results and also point you to the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on Slide 5. 
Unrelated to the acquisition, we had a $367 million noncash charge to write down goodwill and other assets in the CapRock business as a result of the prolonged downturn in the energy market. Acquisition-related items included a $101 million benefit for a net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefit plans, $43 million of integration cost and a $3 million charge related to inventory step-up. We also had restructuring and other charges totaling $35 million, with the majority for workforce and facility reductions. 
So turning now to segment detail on Slide 6 and comparisons to prior year pro forma results as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. Communication Systems' segment revenue was $489 million compared to prior year pro forma of $539 million. Tactical Communications revenue was down 10%, declining primarily due to weakness in Exelis legacy tactical and night vision product lines. Harris legacy Tactical Communications was about flat as a result of strength in international. 
Public Safety revenue was $109 million compared to $116 million in the prior year, declining year-over-year but up 18% sequentially quarter-to-quarter. 
Operating income in the second quarter was $138 million, and operating margin was 28.2% compared to last year's operating income of $144 million and 26.7% margin. 
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 7. Second quarter revenue was $446 million compared to prior year pro forma of $488 million. Higher revenue from 2 classified programs, including the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program was more than offset by the completion of other classified programs and lower GPS III revenue. Operating income in the second quarter was $67 million, and operating margin was 15% compared to last year's operating income of $87 million and 17.8% margin. 
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 8. Second quarter revenue was $382 million compared to prior year pro forma of $451 million. Higher revenue from the ramp in F-35 production was more than offset by lower electronic warfare revenue. Operating income in the second quarter was $69 million, and operating margin was 18.1% compared to last year's operating income of $78 million and 17.3% margin. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 9. Second quarter revenue was $541 million compared to prior year pro forma of $672 million. Lower revenue in IT Services and CapRock's energy market was partially offset by higher FAA revenue, driven by NextGen modernization programs. Operating income in the second quarter was $71 million and operating margin was 13.1% compared to last year's operating income of $83 million and 12.4% margin. 
So let me turn it back to Bill for the guidance discussion and a few wrap-up comments."

So moving to Slides 10 and 11. Revenue guidance on an organic basis is revised from down 3% to 5% to now down 5% to 6%. We expect the impact of lower volume on earnings to be more than offset by the flow-through of the R&D tax credit and cost savings across the company. As a result, non-GAAP EPS guidance has been increased to a range of $5.70 to $5.80. And to remind you, non-GAAP includes intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition of $133 million or about $0.70 per share. 
In Communication Systems, expectations are unchanged. In Space and Intel, operating margin expectations have been revised to a range of 15% to 15.5%, primarily to reflect the higher mix of cost plus revenue and new program starts. In Electronic Systems, revenue expectations have been revised to a range of down 2% to 3% due to a few losses in electronic warfare pursuits combined with a lower-than-expected ramp of previous electronic warfare wins. In Critical Networks, revenue expectations have been revised to down about 14% due to the further weakness in government IT Services and CapRock's energy market. 
So to wrap up, as I said upfront, our top priorities are successfully integrating Exelis, delivering strong free cash flow, deleveraging our balance sheet and continuing to reshape the portfolio. And through the first half of the year, we're making good progress on all of them. So while we still face top line pressure in fiscal '16, integration and other cost-reduction actions are driving good earnings growth, and we expect this rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal '17. 
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

Let me see if I could hit on some of the key things, and I'll provide you, I think, as much as I can on that. First off, the -- on the book-to-bill. And this is all legacy tactical radios, so go back to sort of how the way Harris define tactical radio. Our book-to-bill in the first half was 0.97, so international was 0.99, as mentioned in my remarks, and DoD was a little bit less than that. A little bit softer in Q2, but we had a very strong Q1. Remember, it was about 1.3. Revenue, we believe, came in about as expected in the quarter. A bit stronger in international, which as we said was up 10%. A little bit lower in the DoD. It's flat overall in Q2, and up 3% in the first half. So I think overall, a pretty decent start. For the full year, we still see revenue being flat to down low single digits. We still see DoD to be flat up slightly, and international be down slightly on a year-over-year basis. And it's really shaping up almost as we had expected when we initiated guidance 6 months ago: up, first half; down in the second half on a year-over-year basis. With 2 bigger tranches in 2 specific countries winding down, that makes for tougher comparisons in the back half. We still see sequentially the second half being up versus the first, with Europe and the Middle East both contributing pretty nicely. In fact, Gautam, this year, we think Europe is shaping up to be a record or near-record year for us, driven a lot by this ERI U.S. Government funding for Ukraine and the Baltics as well as a few other Central European, Eastern European countries. But we do see the impact of lower oil pricing that's shifting some of the priorities in some of the countries in the Middle East as well as some of the priorities of the U.S. government. So that's giving us a little bit more caution in the back half. But still, we see second half up sequentially from the first. Now let me turn to the pipeline and just quickly cover that. In the international side, the pipeline is still very robust. It's now $2.9 billion. Last time, it was $2.4 billion. So it's come up as we brought in about a $600 million opportunity for Phase 3 modernization in Australia. We expect that award at the end of fiscal '17, so that is now into our 12- to 18-month pipeline. The Middle East is still very solid. On a dollar basis, it's still about the same as it was before. On a percentage basis, down a little bit. Now slightly under 50% because the size of the overall pipeline has increased. So still very, very broad. Again, Europe is strong. [indiscernible] holding [indiscernible]. And we see Asia coming up pretty nicely, mainly because of Australia. So that's on the international front. On the DoD side, the pipeline's at $890 million, so down slightly from where we were last time, about $925 million, so it's just under $900 million. The mix is still about the same, 60% Air Force, SOCOM, Marine Corps; and about 25% being army; in part, modernization; in part, resets and other opportunities. So let me stop with that, Gautam, and see if I answered that question that you're trying to get at."

The words are rounded out, but numerically, it's the same as we guided before, it's $750 million. And without getting beyond '16 guidance, we do still see, 3 or 4 years out, $1 billion of free cash flow. The drivers are as we expected before. We do see the higher run rate synergies impacting that free cash flows growing from $750 million. We see interest rate reductions, interest cost reductions coming down because we're paying down some debt. We do see continued working capital performance improvements over time. Recall, we are at -- as Harris, last year fiscal '15, about 46 days of working capital. Exelis was quite a bit higher than that. They came in at about 56 days at the end of Q2. So just as we get back to where Harris was before, we see another 10, plus or minus, days of improvement, working capital at about $20 million per day. So we'll close some of that this year. But even we don't close all of that, it's still to be substantial increases in cash flow just simply from working capital. Of course, we also see a little bit of capital spend efficiency over time as well. So those are the major elements. Again, we're still confident about $1 billion 3 to 4 years out."

It doesn't impact the overall size of our international or our Middle East pipeline. We still see opportunities there. The flow of those opportunities to the pipeline are seeing a little bit more friction. And we know in Saudi, Saudi has been a significant opportunity for us, one of the biggers in our pipeline, like Iraq happens to be in others throughout the Middle East. There's 5 or 6 countries that make up the biggest part of international -- Middle East part of our pipeline. And we do see in Saudi, in particular, where their focus on the war in Yemen and military purchases to support that, we're seeing some of the opportunities on our radio business slip a little bit to the right, both in terms of Harris as well as what was legacy Exelis. So that has slipped a little bit to the right. But overall, Noah, I think the opportunity in the Middle East still remains out there. The pipeline size is still very good and very robust. We're very encouraged by the fact that there is strong U.S. government support, FMS support, for opportunities in the Middle East. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we talked about this last time, the ITEF funding, that -- from the U.S. Government is flowing in and is helping us in Q2, and we do expect to see more opportunities into the future. GFY16, it was just about just over $700 million worth of ITEF funding, which is Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, which includes amounts for Syria, so $1.1 billion. So there's a lot of U.S. Government funding that does backstop our Middle East pipeline. So as I said in my remarks, we do see, on a year-over-year basis, the second half in tactical to be down, but sequentially up first half to second half."

We typically see, quarter-to-quarter, some fluctuations, Seth. And you saw -- you went through some of the charts, some sequential deteriorations, some business have been up or down. CN was actually quite strong on a sequential and a year-over-year basis because of mix. There was a lot of FAA work that's going in there, offsetting decline in services as well as in CapRock. Things are moving around a little bit. But we'll see margins continuing to improve going out into next year, simply based on better volume and also the integration savings are going to continue to roll through, and we keep working hard to drive our normal OpEx agenda. So we expect that we'll see margins improving. Right now, I think they're pretty strong this year in CS. We were guiding to 29.5% to 30.5% so we're holding on that. And I do expect, based on mix and the trends that we're seeing in the business, that we could be towards the higher end of that. The SIS business is a government contracting business. While it's a little bit weaker in terms of margins than we expect before, it's pretty solid, 15%, 15.5%. So that, I think, very, very strong. ES at 18% to 19% is a very strong margin. That will be impacted over time by some changes in the mix of the programs as we bring on newer programs and move off of legacy ones, so we'll see some of the integration savings offset some of the mix. In CN, we're just battling right now what's happening in the CapRock business and services. The FAA work in the international opportunities for mission networks or FAA-like opportunities, I think, are going to help us there. So I don't want to get too far out of fiscal '16 in terms of margin guidance here, Seth, but that's where we stand right now for within the year."

Now for Harris, in particular, I think we feel very good about our programs. The tactical radio lines that we typically pull from are well supported. Army modernization, we think it's adequately covered. The FAA looks really good, and the NextGen programs were well-funded in fiscal '16. We were pleased to see funding for GPS III, which is an important Exelis program on SV-9 and 10. Weather programs were well supported, and I'm glad that you'd see the recent award come through very recently on the CrIS payloads for JPSS-3 and 4. F-35, we got a pretty large content per ship set. Again, we're seeing that ramp. That was well supported. In additional -- the F-18 aircraft into the budget. I think was were 7 or 8 aircraft. It was also good because Exelis has an EW product line for the F-18.

It's now down, probably in the 23%, 25% range over the course of the year. But we do see, at least sequentially, it's stabilizing quarter-to-quarter, going through the back end of fiscal '16. Our book-to-bill in Q2 in the first half was reasonably good. It was over 1. Of course, it's on a lower revenue environment, but the book-to-bill was pretty good, which again, gets us encouraged that we can support some stability in the back half. We also have incumbent positions on some legacy programs that as the roll-off start to ease, I think we'll see more stability in the back half. So for the pipeline that we have, we've got a very large pipeline of opportunities that we're chasing. It's actually come up a couple of billion from the beginning of the year. It's something like $24 billion now. We have -- within Harris, we've got to make sure that we're -- we improve our win rate. Our win rate is a little bit below what our target happens to be. It's -- we typically win in the 23%, 25%. It should be 30% or more. So we're not winning quite as much as we need to be.

We are getting into our strategic planning process, and that'll kind of inform a little bit more on what sort of portfolio we want over the long term. And so I won't really comment about any specific business. But at the end of the day, a couple of things I would share with you, one, we are a technology-based company. We invest in new product development, and we want to use technology to differentiate offerings in the marketplace. So one of the key things that I look for are the things that the businesses that we want to begin should be able to be differentiated by providing some technology. We are also a mission-critical communication defense electronics-type company. So for the aerostructures business, we've got these large composite skins and large factories and lot of capital intensity. It really didn't necessarily fit with the rest of what we'd look like. So I think that one, as we came into the year, we're looking hard at which businesses should management focus its time and attention on, on a continuum of businesses that go from very, very strategic-like tactical radios on the far left to maybe less strategic on the far right, being aerostructures. Other businesses sit in the middle, and I'm using the criteria that I just described to assess which ones we should keep and which we should not. At the end of the day, does it fit strategically? Is it more valuable to us versus to somebody else? We look at performance of the company, performance of the business. All of those factors come into play in determining which ones we should keep and which ones we should not."

It is growing very, very quickly. And with a very significant change in the supply structure of bandwidth -- satellite bandwidth, we're able to use that leverage to both negotiate better deals, better pricing and globally consistent pricing, so we don't have, for different types of satellites, for different customers in different regions, very different pricing. We're looking for pricing uniformity, and that helps us run our business a little more efficiently and effectively. And that's what we're heading on the bandwidth deal.

There's a process that they've laid out. I think it's a little bit on the aggressive side. There's questions and capability assessments that are due, coming up here in February and March. Bids are due on, I think, the 29th of April. They don't get extended. My expectation, at least what comes out in the RFP, is a June award -- a preliminary in June. And then it goes to the state consultation period for 90 days, where the states have an opportunity to opt-in or opt-out. And then, after which, whoever is the preliminary award winner would resubmit a new bid and with a final award by November of '16. So that, to me, it's a pretty aggressive time line. I think the RFP, Josh, feels like it's geared more towards commercial carriers as primes, just by the way it's written and some of the requirements in the RFP.

Thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Our second quarter and first half results are largely in line with our expectations for how fiscal '16 would unfold. While Q2 revenue was a bit weaker than expected, we anticipate operating within the con",1405,"Okay. Thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Our second quarter and first half results are largely in line with our expectations for how fiscal '16 would unfold. While Q2 revenue was a bit weaker than expected, we anticipate operating within the continuing soft revenue environment, with Q2 being the weakest of the year relative to prior-year results due to the budget process and a difficult compare in the legacy Exelis business. And as we've previously communicated, our #1 priority this year would be integrating Exelis and realizing the synergy savings and earnings accretion we have promised, and we're executing well against that goal. We're also delivering on our commitment to maximize free cash flow, to quickly delever, and to dispassionately evaluate portfolio reshaping, as today's announcements and results will demonstrate. 
Second quarter earnings were solid, and free cash flow was particularly strong. And again, this quarter, we made excellent progress in achieving integration savings. We've also identified additional opportunities and now expect to reach run rate savings exiting fiscal '17 of $140 million to $150 million, significantly higher than the $120 million we previously communicated. First half free cash flow is supporting our deleveraging priority, reducing term loan debt $200 million in the quarter and $383 million since closing the transaction in late May. 
We're also pleased to report being far down the path of divesting the aerostructures business, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and was determined to not be strategic to Harris. Aerostructures is currently reported within the Electronic Systems segment and had calendar '15 revenue of $77 million. After receiving considerable interest from potential buyers, we are narrowing the group to a select few and expect to reach a definitive agreement soon. 
We'll also continue to evaluate our now much broader portfolio with a dispassionate view towards which businesses are strategically aligned and which are not. We also continue to adapt to market conditions and adjust our cost structure accordingly, as we have in the past. In the second quarter, due to the prolonged downturn in CapRock's energy market, we took a noncash write-down of goodwill and other assets, and we launched restructuring and other actions that were primarily in CapRock. Our goal is to rightsize the business in line with market conditions, and these latest actions reduced their headcount by about 20%. When combined with steps we took in Q4 last year, headcount at CapRock will be down about 35% over the last 18 months. All together, these actions are expected to generate modest savings in fiscal '16 and about $20 million to $25 million in fiscal '17. 
So let me turn quickly to quarterly results in Slide 3 in the presentation, and I'll remind you that our discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per share was $1.49, with acquisition savings supporting operating performance in a still relatively soft revenue environment, with the recently reenacted R&D tax credit contributing $0.10 per share. Reported revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.21 billion in the prior year. And on an organic basis, while we anticipated a difficult year-over-year revenue compare, it was a little weaker than expected at down 14%, so let me give you a little more color on the drivers. About 4 to 5 points of the decline related to Exelis overdrive in their Q4 '14 results. Government IT Services contributed another 5 points which, as we've mentioned before, would be impacted by the wind-down of a couple of large contracts in a still slow procurement environment. And CapRock with another point or so, with the remaining business contributing about 3 points. 
On the positive side, Harris legacy international tactical revenue was up a strong 10% in the quarter, resulting in Harris total legacy tactical revenue at about flat with the prior year and about as expected for the quarter. Revenue was also higher in geospatial imagery, driven by the continued ramp of our large classified Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, and was also higher with the FAA, driven by NextGen modernization programs. On a sequential basis for the company, revenue was up 2%, with all segments higher except Critical Networks, which includes IT Services and CapRock. 
Orders in the quarter were $1.5 billion. And together with strong orders booked in Q1, first half book-to-bill was just over 1. In IT Services, although revenue was down in the quarter, orders were encouraging, driving a book-to-bill of 1.1 for the quarter and the first half. And we expect first half orders, combined with incumbent positions on existing programs, will support back-half revenue stability. 
In CapRock, our strategy to diversify our business into the cruise market, where bandwidth demand is growing, is helping to offset a bit of the energy revenue weakness. Over the last 2 years, bandwidth demand on cruise ships has increased exponentially, from an average of less than 5 megabits per ship to now 35 megabits, with 1 gigabit in sight for the largest vessels. And it's important to note that our position in the cruise market is solid, with 2.5 years left on our 5-year agreement with Carnival and another 5 years left with Royal Caribbean, following a contract extension that was awarded in the quarter. Perhaps as important, diversification brings us significant volume leverage for purchasing satellite bandwidth, and our scale has allowed us to consolidate bandwidth, drive down cost and implement a sales approach of one price over one global system, regardless of market, to further drive efficiency gains in the organization. 
In Tactical Communications, we previously highlighted U.S. funding support for foreign military sales from both the base budget as well as from OCO accounts for special initiatives, such as the European Reassurance Initiative, the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund for Middle East and Africa, and the Iraq Train and Equip Fund, or ITEF. The funding supported our strong 1Q bookings. And in 2Q, we booked $66 million in orders supported by ITEF. We ended the first half of the year with an international tactical book-to-bill of 0.99. On the U.S. tactical front, progress continues to be made on army modernization, and we were encouraged that the army requested best and final offers from all bidders for the 2-channel Manpack radio and reconfirmed their calendar Q1 award date. 
In Public Safety, orders were up more than 30% on a weak prior-year compare, with book-to-bill greater than 1 on a fairly good revenue level of $109 million. Orders included $20 million from Arizona Public Services, the state's largest electrical utility company; and $18 million from the Air National Guard that includes our latest product offering, the multiband XL-200P radio. While we're still not satisfied with our Public Safety results, we've expressed multiple times that improving performance in the business will come as a result of solving basic execution challenges, introducing new products, improving quality, strengthening front line and program management capabilities, and we're beginning to see positive signs that the business is slowly turning the corner. 
In Space and Intel, on top of strong Q1 wins from classified customers, we received healthy orders of $172 million and another $23 million contract to support space superiority missions. Space superiority and protection has become a U.S. Defense priority and is expected to receive $8 billion in funding over the next 5 years. Our first half wins in space superiority, combined with the strong funding support, should make this an area of solid growth for the company into the future. 
And following the close of the quarter, the Space and Intel segment was awarded a $316 million follow-on contract for NASA for the Cross-track Infrared Sounder, or CrIS payloads, on the third and fourth weather satellites for the Joint Polar Satellite System. These payloads provide key global data used by the National Weather Service, and for Harris, the award continues the strong customer relationship we enjoy with NASA and with NOAA. 
And then just recently in Critical Networks, we were awarded a 9-year, $44 million contract from the U.K.'s air navigation service provider, called NATS, to modernize their voice communication's infrastructure. This represents our first international win in this area and results from leveraging technology provided under the FAA's NextGen modernization program to now address the global market. 
So with the successful integration of Exelis as our #1 focus for the company, I've asked Sheldon to join us again this quarter to provide a little more detail in integration and the additional opportunities the team has identified. Sheldon?"

If you turn to Slide 4. Again, this quarter, we've made excellent progress in achieving integration savings and have identified several new opportunities. The team quickly developed plans to capture these additional savings, and we're pleased to report that 100% of our cost-saving projects are either complete or in progress. As Bill noted earlier, we now expect net run rate savings to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million as we exit fiscal '17, up significantly from our previous estimate of $120 million. Associated with this, we now expect gross integration cost of $250 million and net cost of $200 million, after government reimbursements. Additional savings are primarily in 2 areas: footprint rationalization and supply chain. 
In the Q1 call, we highlighted moving the SINCGARS tactical radio manufacturing operations from Fort Wayne to Rochester. And just last week, we completed production of our very first SINCGARS radio assembly in our Rochester state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. With this project well underway, we've launched new facility consolidation projects in 5 locations that will reduce footprint by an additional 230,000 square feet, bringing total company square-footage reduction related to the acquisition down 15% since closing. 
The second area of additional savings comes from a thorough review of our supply chain. We've spent a lot of time building the database to compare what Exelis buys to what Harris buys and what each pays on price, down to the individual part number, to understand our supply chain spending across the combined company. With this database in place, we launched multiple projects across a broad range of spend categories, from electronic components to company travel, to eliminate price disparity and leverage our much larger volume to reduce costs. We also launched should-cost analyses and value-engineering initiatives to further drive supply chain savings. A quick example is a should-cost analysis that identified a 20% reduction in the price of a key component used across our night-vision product line. We see a lot of opportunities like these, which will add to our pipeline of regular annual operational excellence projects. And while not highlighted on the page, an underlying core theme of our integration is to reduce complexity throughout the company. And we're using this opportunity to take the best of both companies' approach to simplify and standardize across the new Harris. We've already reduced the number of health plans by 50%, corporate policies by 40% and legal entities by 12%. And we're targeting a 50% reduction in core IT applications and an even greater reduction in the number of data centers. So as we enter the back half of the first year of integration, we're excited about the progress so far and confident that driving standardization and simplification across the business will build a solid foundation for the future. 
And with that, I'll turn over to Mick to discuss segment results."

Before turning to each segment, we'll provide some color around the onetime items in the quarter that are excluded from our non-GAAP results, and also point you to the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on Slide 5. 
Unrelated to the acquisition, we had a $367 million noncash charge to write down goodwill and other assets in the CapRock business as a result of the prolonged downturn in the energy market. Acquisition-related items included a $101 million benefit for a net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefit plans, $43 million of integration cost and a $3 million charge related to inventory step-up. We also had restructuring and other charges totaling $35 million, with the majority for workforce and facility reductions. 
So turning now to segment detail on Slide 6 and comparisons to prior-year pro forma results as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. Communication Systems' segment revenue was $489 million compared to prior-year pro forma of $539 million. Tactical Communications revenue was down 10%, declining primarily due to weakness in Exelis legacy tactical and night-vision product lines. Harris legacy Tactical Communications was about flat as a result of strength in international. 
Public Safety revenue was $109 million compared to $116 million in the prior year, declining year-over-year but up 18% sequentially quarter-to-quarter. 
Operating income in the second quarter was $138 million, and operating margin was 28.2% compared to last year's operating income of $144 million and 26.7% margin. 
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 7. Second quarter revenue was $446 million compared to prior-year pro forma of $488 million. Higher revenue from 2 classified programs, including the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, was more than offset by the completion of other classified programs and lower GPS III revenue. Operating income in the second quarter was $67 million and operating margin was 15% compared to last year's operating income of $87 million and 17.8% margin. 
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 8. Second quarter revenue was $382 million compared to prior-year pro forma of $451 million. Higher revenue from the ramp in F-35 production was more than offset by lower electronic warfare revenue. Operating income in the second quarter was $69 million and operating margin was 18.1% compared to last year's operating income of $78 million and 17.3% margin. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 9. Second quarter revenue was $541 million compared to prior year pro forma of $672 million. Lower revenue in IT Services and CapRock's energy market was partially offset by higher FAA revenue, driven by NextGen modernization programs. Operating income in the second quarter was $71 million and operating margin was 13.1% compared to last year's operating income of $83 million and 12.4% margin. 
So let me turn it back to Bill for the guidance discussion and a few wrap-up comments."

So moving to Slides 10 and 11. Revenue guidance on an organic basis is revised from down 3% to 5% to now down 5% to 6%. We expect the impact of lower volume on earnings to be more than offset by the flow-through of the R&D tax credit and cost savings across the company. As a result, non-GAAP EPS guidance has been increased to a range of $5.70 to $5.80. And to remind you, non-GAAP includes intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition of $133 million or about $0.70 per share. 
In Communication Systems, expectations are unchanged. In Space and Intel, operating margin expectations have been revised to a range of 15% to 15.5%, primarily to reflect the higher mix of cost plus revenue and new program starts. In Electronic Systems, revenue expectations have been revised to a range of down 2% to 3% due to a few losses in electronic warfare pursuits combined with a lower-than-expected ramp of previous electronic warfare wins. In Critical Networks, revenue expectations have been revised to down about 14% due to further weakness in government IT Services and CapRock's energy market. 
So to wrap up, as I said upfront, our top priorities are successfully integrating Exelis, delivering strong free cash flow, deleveraging our balance sheet and continuing to reshape the portfolio. And through the first half of the year, we're making good progress on all of them. So while we still face top line pressure in fiscal '16, integration and other cost-reduction actions are driving good earnings growth, and we expect this rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal '17. 
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

Let me see if I could hit on some of the key things, and I'll provide you, I think, as much as I can on that. First off, the -- on the book-to-bill -- and this is all legacy tactical radio, so go back to sort of how the way Harris defined tactical radio. Our book-to-bill in the first half was 0.97, so international was 0.99, as mentioned in my remarks, and DoD was a little bit less than that. A little bit softer in Q2, but we had a very strong Q1. Remember, it was about 1.3. Revenue, we believe, came in about as expected in the quarter. A bit stronger in international, which as we said was up 10%. A little bit lower in the DoD. It's flat overall in Q2, and up 3% in the first half. So I think overall, a pretty decent start. For the full year, we still see revenue being flat to down low single digits. We still see DoD to be flat, up slightly, and international be down slightly on a year-over-year basis. And it's really shaping up almost as we had expected when we initiated guidance 6 months ago: up, first half; down in the second half on a year-over-year basis. With 2 bigger tranches in 2 specific countries winding down, that makes for tougher comparisons in the back half. We still see sequentially the second half being up versus the first, with Europe and the Middle East both contributing pretty nicely. In fact, Gautam, this year, we think Europe is shaping up to be a record or near-record year for us, driven a lot by this ERI U.S. Government funding for Ukraine and the Baltics as well as a few other Central European, Eastern European countries. But we do see the impact of lower oil pricing that's shifting some of the priorities in some of the countries in the Middle East as well as some of the priorities of the U.S. government. So that's giving us a little bit more caution in the back half. But still, we see second half up sequentially from the first. Now let me turn to the pipeline and just quickly cover that. In the international side, the pipeline is still very robust. It's now $2.9 billion. Last time, it was $2.4 billion. So it's come up as we brought in about a $600 million opportunity for Phase 3 modernization in Australia. We expect that award at the end of fiscal '17, so that is now into our 12- to 18-month pipeline. The Middle East is still very solid. On a dollar basis, it's still about the same as it was before. On a percentage basis, down a little bit. Now slightly under 50% because the size of the overall pipeline has increased. So still very, very broad. Again, Europe is strong. CAL [ph] is holding SIRV [ph]. And we see Asia coming up pretty nicely, mainly because of Australia. So that's on the international front. On the DoD side, the pipeline's at $890 million, so down slightly from where we were last time, about $925 million, so it's just under $900 million. The mix is still about the same, 60% Air Force, SOCOM, Marine Corps; and about 25% being army; in part, modernization; in part, resets and other opportunities. So let me stop with that, Gautam, and see if I answered that question that you're trying to get at."

The words around it have, but numerically, it's the same as we guided before, so $750 million. And without getting beyond '16 guidance, we do still see, 3 or 4 years out, $1 billion of free cash flow. The drivers are as we expected before. We do see the higher run rate synergies impacting that free cash flow, so growing from $750 million. We see interest rate reductions, interest cost reductions coming down because we're paying down some debt. We do see continued working capital performance improvements over time. Recall, we are at -- as Harris, last year fiscal '15, about 46 days of working capital. Exelis was quite a bit higher than that. We came in at about 56 days at the end of Q2. So just as we get back to where Harris was before, we see another 10, plus or minus, days of improvement in working capital at about $20 million per day. So we'll close some of that this year. But even if we don't close all of that, it still could be substantial increases in cash flow just simply from working capital. Of course, we also see a little bit of capital spend efficiency over time as well. So those are the major elements. Again, we're still confident about $1 billion, 3 to 4 years out."

It doesn't impact the overall size of our international or our Middle East pipeline. We still see opportunities there. The flow of those opportunities through the pipeline are seeing a little bit more friction. And we know in Saudi, Saudi has been a significant opportunity for us, one of the biggers in our pipeline, like Iraq happens to be, and others throughout the Middle East. There's 5 or 6 countries that make up the biggest part of our international -- Middle East part of our pipeline. And we do see in Saudi, in particular, where their focus on the war in Yemen and military purchases to support that, we're seeing some of the opportunities on our radio business slip a little bit to the right, both in terms of Harris as well as what was legacy Exelis. So that has slipped a little bit to the right. But overall, Noah, I think the opportunity in the Middle East still remains out there. The pipeline size is still very good and very robust. We're very encouraged by the fact that there is strong U.S. government support, FMS support, for opportunities in the Middle East. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we talked about this last time, the ITEF funding, that flow from the U.S. Government is flowing in and is helping us in Q2, and we do expect to see more opportunities into the future. GFY '16, it was about just over $700 million worth of ITEF funding, which is Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, which includes amounts for Syria, so $1.1 billion. So there's a lot of U.S. Government funding that does backstop our Middle East pipeline. So as I said in my remarks, we do see, on a year-over-year basis, the second half in tactical to be down, but sequentially up first half to second half."

We typically see, quarter-to-quarter, some fluctuations, Seth. And you saw -- you went through some of the charts, some sequential deterioration, some business have been up or down. CN was actually quite strong on a sequential and a year-over-year basis because of mix. There was a lot of FAA work that's going in there, offsetting decline in services as well as in CapRock. Things are moving around a little bit. But we'll see margins continuing to improve going out into next year, simply based on better volume and also the integration savings are going to continue to roll through, and we keep working hard to drive our normal OpEx agenda. So we expect that we'll see margins improving. Right now, I think they're pretty strong. This year in CS, we're guiding to 29.5% to 30.5%, so we're holding on that. And I do expect, based on mix and the trends that we're seeing in the business, that we could be towards the higher end of that. The SIS business is a government contracting business. While it's a little bit weaker in terms of margins than we expected before, it's pretty solid, 15%, 15.5%. So that, I think, very, very strong. ES at 18% to 19% is a very strong margin. That will be impacted over time by some changes in the mix of the programs as we bring on newer programs and move off of legacy ones, so we'll see some of the integration savings offset some of the mix. In CN, we're just battling right now what's happening in the CapRock business and services. The FAA work and the international opportunities for mission networks or FAA-like opportunities, I think, are going to help us there. So I don't want to get too far out of fiscal '16 in terms of margin guidance here, Seth, but that's where we stand right now for within the year."

But I think from the fiscal '16 basis, like others in the industry have been expressing, the 2-year deal feels pretty good. It's good for Harris, it's good for the industry. We see what's happening in the DoD base budget this year and next year, so it's on the upswing, at least a little bit, and which I think is very positive. Now for Harris, in particular, I think we feel very good about our programs. The tactical radio lines that we typically pull from are well supported. Army modernization, we think it's adequately covered. The FAA looks really good, and the NextGen programs were well funded in fiscal '16. We were pleased to see funding for GPS III, which is an important Exelis program on SV-9 and 10. Weather programs were well supported, and I'm glad that you'd see the recent award come through very recently on the CrIS payloads for JPSS-3 and 4. F-35, we got a pretty large content per ship set. Again, we're seeing that ramp. That was well supported. The additional -- the F-18 aircraft into the budget, I think it was 7 or 8 aircraft, was also good because Exelis has an EW product line for the F-18. And again, finally, OCO, we feel good about because of the amounts that are in there, which support some of the international FMS opportunities that we're going after in our tactical business. So overall, Seth, I think we feel pretty good about where the budget came out."

And I think, as we've been talking about probably for the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've been impacted by a couple of sizable program roll-offs. We still see the overall procurement environment being relatively weak. We adjusted our full year expectations for IT Services. We came into the year thinking we'd be down mid-teens. It's now down, probably, in the 23%, 25% range over the course of the year. But we do see, at least sequentially, it stabilizing quarter-to-quarter, going through the back end of fiscal '16. Our book-to-bill in Q2 in the first half was reasonably good. It was over 1. Of course, it's on a lower revenue environment, but the book-to-bill was pretty good, which again gets us encouraged that we can support some stability in the back half. We also have incumbent positions on some legacy programs that, as the roll-offs start to ease, I think we'll see more stability in the back half. So for the pipeline that we have, we've got a very large pipeline of opportunities that we're chasing. It's actually come up a couple of billion from the beginning of the year. It's something like $24 billion now. We have -- within Harris, we've got to make sure that we're -- we improve our win rate. Our win rate is a little bit below what our target happens to be. It's -- we typically win in the 23%, 25%. It should be 30% or more. So we're not winning quite as much as we need to be. A lot of that's really around our frontline execution and our process execution, and we're getting that fixed. So I do think, Rob, that part of this is a slow environment, and part of it is what we need to do to improve our own win rate internally within the company."

We are getting into our strategic planning process, and that'll kind of inform a little bit more on what sort of portfolio we want over the long term. And so I won't really comment about any specific business. But at the end of the day, a couple of things I would share with you. One, we are a technology-based company. We invest in new product development, and we want to use technology to differentiate offerings in the marketplace. So one of the key things that I look for are the things that -- the businesses that we want to be in should be able to be differentiated by providing some technology. We are also a mission-critical communication defense electronics-type company. So for the aerostructures business, we've got these large composite skins and large factories with a lot of capital intensity. It really didn't necessarily fit with the rest of what we'd look like. So I think that one, as we came into the year, we're looking hard at which businesses should management focus its time and attention on, on a continuum of businesses that go from very, very strategic, like tactical radios on the far left, to maybe less strategic on the far right, being aerostructures. Other businesses sit in the middle, and I'm using the criteria that I just described to assess which ones we should keep and which we should not. At the end of the day, does it fit strategically? Is it more valuable to us versus to somebody else? We look at performance of the company, performance of the business. All of those factors come into play in determining which ones we should keep and which ones we should not."

There's a process that they've laid out. I think it's a little bit on the aggressive side. There's questions and capability assessments that are due, coming up here in February and March. Bids are due on, I think, the 29th of April, if they don't get extended. My expectation, at least, of what comes out in the RFP is a June award -- a preliminary award in June. And then it goes to the state consultation period for 90 days, where the states have an opportunity to opt in or opt out. And then, after which, whoever is the preliminary award winner would resubmit a new bid, and with a final award by November of '16. So that, to me, it's a pretty aggressive time line. I think the RFP, Josh, feels like it's geared more towards commercial carriers as primes, just by the way it's written and some of the requirements in the RFP. We are, as Harris, still assessing the role that we're going to play. Since it's a live competitive procurement, I don't think we want to talk more about that.

Looking to the full year and the now slower pace in the Middle East, together with a DoD tactical radio opportunity that has slipped into next year, we're adjusting our fiscal '16 earnings per share guidance to about $5.70, the bottom end of the prior ranfe, on revenue of about $7.5 billion. Rahul will provide more color in a minute, but the only segment that's change is Communication Systems where we're now expecting legacy tactical revenue to be down high single digits with similar declines in both international and DoD. 
So let me start with a little color and what's driving the change. We started the year anticipating Harris legacy international of flat to down, even though we are coming off several years of strong expansion in international, including a record fiscal '15. But at the time we have started to see some opportunities in the Middle East, market stretched out a bit. The first half of the year played out about as we thought with international revenue up 5%, including higher revenue from the Middle East as a result of strong FMS funding support. And while we were expecting a year-over-year back half decline in the Middle East, we anticipated sequential revenue growth. With combination of fiscal pressures and funding priorities in country and with the U.S. government as well as a slow FMS approval process have shifted opportunities to the right. 
We believe the slow pace in the Middle East is temporary. Security issues and the need for more capable practical communications remain unchanged and FMS funding support remains strong for the region with additional money earmarked in the GFY 17 president's budget request. 
In the U.S. technical market, while our book-to-bill was above 1 in the quarter, upgrade opportunities is expected and fiscal '16 are now unlikely to begin before the end of the year. While the capability is designed to our new 2 channel Manpack for the U.S. Army, we've also adapted the wave form so that could be easily ported to a simple download into our  117G radios, 30,000 of which are currently fielded in DoD inventory. 
We demonstrated connectivity between our radio and the satellite. We're on track to receive NASA certification shortly and customers across several services are anxious to benefit from the mobility and higher bandwidth that the Constellation provides. This is a very real and compelling value proposition for our customers and funding for this opportunity has been earmarked in GFY '16. We anticipate this funding converting to an order for Harris before the end of September. 
So while fiscal '16 is a bit softer than expected in Tactical Communications, our outlook is solid and our competitive position has never been stronger. In the DoD, we won or have a position on every major tactical radio contract awarded in the last 5 years. The mid-tier radio, MNVR 1 in 2013, the Raytheon Radio One last year, the SOCOM 2-channel handheld 1 earlier this year and most recently, the very large HMS Manpack awarded in February. These are all significant wins for Harris, so let me update you on the latest developments. 
After more than 4 years of tenacious effort, the Army awarded Harris a 10-year $12.7 billion IDIQ contract for the multichannel Manpack radio, opening a market for Harris which had previously been closed to competition. Qualification and customer test are starting soon and scheduled to wrap up by the end of our fiscal '17, with the initial production delivery order award currently scheduled in early fiscal 18. The $3.7 billion Rifleman Radio procurement is also progressing well. We've now completed both qualification and customer tests, receiving positive feedback on operational capabilities such as range and battery life. 
An initial production delivery order is expected in the second half of fiscal '17. SOCOM's modernization is also moving forward and the protest of Harris' single award for the $390 million 2-channel handheld radio program was recently resolved in our favor and work has begun. Product deliveries began in the first half of fiscal '18. This radio features both communications and ISR capabilities and since SOCOM has long been an early adopter of cutting-edge technology that eventually finds its way into the broader DoD and international militaries, it positions us well to compete on a number of other modernization programs. 
The handheld is part of our broader modernization program that SOCOM is said to reach $900 million and included a new Manpack and HF radio. The Manpack RFP is expected late this summer and contract award before the end of fiscal '17, with the HF Radio following some time thereafter. 
On the international front, the pipeline remains about $2.9 billion and is diverse in terms of regions, countries and customers within the country. And while the near-term velocity has slowed a bit in the Middle East, continued progress is being made elsewhere. In the last earnings call, we mentioned that a $600 million opportunity for Australia's Phase III modernization had moved into the pipeline with an award expected by the end of fiscal '17. We've now been selected as the preferred supplier with a significantly broader scope where Harris will now prime to deliver an integrated solution. This is a key part of our long-term growth strategy and international to expand our addressable market, leverage capabilities from across Harris and evolved from a radio supplier to now providing entire systems. 
Turning to a few highlights in other areas of the company. Both Space and Intel and electronic systems had strong orders, higher sequential and year-over-year organic revenue and book-to-bill greater than 1. Approximately 70% of Exelis' legacy business reside in these 2 segments and contributed to the positive sales and orders trend. 
In space and Intel, awards from classified customers totaled $329 million with continued strong budget support for intelligence program and the ongoing customer focus on space superiority and protection capabilities. On the commercial space side, there are signs of a recapitalization cycle and fleet expansions beginning and we recently received a $37 million order to provide an 18-meter unfurlable antenna reflector for the JC 17 geostationary communications satellite. The prospects in our space antenna business are stronger today than they've been in the last decade. 
Within Electronic Systems, we enjoyed another quarter of strong electronic warfare bookings, including $88 million to supply electronic jammers for the F-18 aircraft. And the excellent example of modernization opportunities on existing platforms with a very long tail. Electronic warfare is now on track in fiscal '16 to double orders over the prior year and end the year with about $200 million higher backlog. 
Strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging remain top priorities for Harris. And at the end of the third quarter, year-to-date free cash flow stood at $425 million, supporting expectations for the year of $750 million. On April 8, we completed the sale of Aerostructures and used that cash proceeds to pay down debt. So less than a year after closing that Exelis acquisition, we've repaid $683 million of term loan debt, which is approximately 1/3 of the total that we've committed to repaying over 3 years. 
So now before turning the call over to Rahul Ghai, our new Chief Financial Officer, to cover the detailed financial results and guidance, I will provide a brief introduction. 
As you already know, Rahul joined Harris and March of 2015 to lead the finance integration team and was named CFO in early February. By leading the finance integration team over the last year, Rahul has been essential to our integration success and has provided a smooth and natural transition to CFO. Rahul and I work closely together for 5 of his 12 years at United Technologies. And again, over the past year as we've integrated Exelis. I'm confident in Rahul's ability to lead that Harris finance organization and be a true business partner to me and to the rest of the management team. 
So Rahul?"

Before starting, I would like to remind you that our discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. Now turning to third quarter results on Slide 3 in the presentation. EPS was $1.45, with acquisition savings sup",959,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before starting, I would like to remind you that our discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. 
Now turning to third quarter results on Slide 3 in the presentation. EPS was $1.45, with acquisition savings supporting operating performance and benefiting from a lower-than-expected tax rate in the quarter. Reported revenue was $1.91 billion compared to $1.19 billion in the prior year. On an organic basis, revenue was down 3%. Strong revenue growth in Space and Intelligence Systems and Electronic Systems was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services and International Tactical, in both legacy Harris and Exelis. Sequentially, revenue was up 3.6% with higher revenue across 3 of our 4 segments with the exception of the Communication Systems where revenue was less than 1 point lower than the revenue in the second quarter. 
EBIT margin for the company held strong at 16.4%, driven by excellent margin performance across all segments and reflecting continued focus on driving integration savings and lowering cost across the company. Orders in the quarter were $2.1 billion, bringing year-to-date book-to-bill to 1.06 company for the company and was greater than 1 in each segment in the third quarter, with the exception of Communication Systems. 
Within the Communication Systems, third quarter book-to-bill for Tactical Communications was 0.8, with legacy Harris business at 0.83. And in the supplemental pages of the presentation, we have included historical order and backlog detail for legacy Harris tactical business. Public Safety book-to-bill was a bit disappointing at 0.5 and reflects that while the business is slowly improving with revenue up 15% in the quarter, we are not beyond the choppiness. 
In Space and Intelligence, orders strength continued in the classified area. In Electronic Systems, orders was strong, electronic warfare and also in avionics, where we received $121 million in follow-on contracts for the F-35. In Critical Networks, FAA funding was a significant driver and both capital energy and maritime reported book-to-bill of more than 1. 
For Harris overall, awards are on track to achieve the book-to-bill of 1 or close to 1 for the year. So turning to segment detail on Slide 4 and comparisons to prior-year performance results as Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. 
Communication System third quarter revenue was $485 million and down 10%. Tactical Communication was down 16% and Public Safety was up 15% compared to the prior year. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower revenue in Middle East for both Harris and Exelis legacy businesses and completion of Australia's Phase II modernization program. Operating income was $154 million and operating margin was a strong 31.8%. 
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $489 million and up 7% compared to prior year. Driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs including programs in space superiority. Operating income in the third quarter was $76 million and operating margin was 15.5%. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded $81 million in follow-on contracts with $26 million ordered for sustained ground-based systems that support U.S. missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance missions from the Air Force for the sensor program. 
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $393 million and up 6.2% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from the F-35 program and Counter IED systems was partially offset by lower revenue from commercial broadband, satellite program terminals. Operating income in the third quarter was $75 million and operating margin was excellent at 19.1%. 
Just following the close of the quarter, we completed the sale of Aerostructures, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and reported within the Electronic Systems. While not material to Harris, we have included historical financial information's of Aerostructures for fiscal '15 and '16 in the supplemental section of the presentation. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue was $551 million and down 10% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's nextgen modernization programs was more than offset for lower revenue in IT Services from the wind down of 2 major programs and lower revenue in CapRock's energy market.  Operating income in the third quarter was $59 million and operating margin was 10.7%. 
So moving to Slides 8 and 9. Total company revenue guidance on organic basis is revised from down 5% to 6% to down about 7%, driven by lower revenue in Communication Systems. The impact of lower revenue is expected to be partially offset by cost savings across the company and lower taxes. As a result, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be approximately $5.70, the lower end of the penis guidance range. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be down between 8% to 9%, with Harris legacy tactical down in single digits. With lower volume for the year, operating margin is expected to be about 29% in the segment, which is at the lower end of the previous range. 
In Electronic Systems, expectations remain unchanged with the exception of removing Aerostructures for the remainder of the year. With Aerostructures removed, revenue was revised to a range of down 3% to 4% and equivalent the pre-was organic expectations of down 2% to 3%. Operating margin is unchanged at 18% to 19%. And in Space and Intelligence and Critical Networks, expectations remain unchanged. The expected tax rate for fiscal '16 has been revised from 32.5% to 31% due to international tax settlements for prior years and from integration steps that have lowered state taxes. 
Beyond fiscal '16, we expect to benefit from lower state taxes and R&D tax credit. So Let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

We're executing well on the integration and the results are benefiting from synergy capture. 
From day 1 of integration, we've been tracking a little ahead of schedule in reaching integration targets, which is a great achievement from the team. So as we maneuvered through pockets of revenue softness, it's evident that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improved operating resiliency. With less than a year into the acquisition, achieving our current expectation of about 11% earnings growth is a good outcome. 
Looking ahead, we expect fiscal '16's rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal '17, supported by higher synergy savings and other cost reduction actions. In the meantime, we'll continue to gain traction in our multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis, lower cost and deliver accretion, shape our business portfolio, drive strong free cash flow and deleverage, all while still investing in technology and new product development to drive future growth.

So we're not going to provide some guidance today, but there's several things that are on our radar screen that we'd like to see happen in the near term that it'll help some of the guidance will provide in early August. In the DOD side, both Nuos [ph] and the MNVR radio, the mid-tier radio, together wil contribute to higher earnings, higher revenue in fiscal '17. Nuos which did solid quarter is we expect to receive certifications on that this summer, NASA certification. We've already demonstrated on-air performance for both the voice and data. It's well supported, funds are allocated and it's a very strong and compelling business case, so we're very proud that's going to happen over the next several months. On the mid-Tier side, on the MNVR, that will be in tens of millions of dollars, it's well supported in the President's budget request as well as in the NDAA that just came out. The network assessment is going on as we speak. And we expect a production award towards the end of government fiscal year '16, so around September timeframe. I think on the international side which is become a bigger part of our business and it's a very large pipeline, we're looking at what's occurring in Eastern Europe and the Ukraine where we've very, very strong in fiscal '16. We need that to continue. We need to see the opportunities that we've seen very well in Iraq in fiscal '16. We expect that to continue at the same level as we see in '16. And again, opportunities in Iraw to us, as we speak today, seem to be well supported. One of the opportunities in the international that slipped out of fiscal '16 into '17 is in Iraq, but it's well funded. We think that that's going to happen in the '17. There's another country in the Middle East we can't name where an opportunity did slip out and we expect that to happen in early '17 as well. And then finally, in Central Asia, meaning specifically Afghanistan, we've had a very strong year this year. Opportunities there seem well supported. And we do expect Afghanistan and, more broadly, Central Asia to be a strong contributor to revenue into next year. Now outside the Tactical Communication, we have a broader business outside of legacy tactical, we have a broader communications business, including Exelis, the radio business from Exelis, which is mostly international. We've been tracking an opportunity in Saudi Arabia for quite some time. It's about $40 million, $50 million in size for radio for vehicles. It's been hung up in the Saudi Royal Court for a number of months and we need that to break free as we get into '17 as well. So maybe Pete, just a little bit of shape and color around what we expect going to next year."

And this focus is really on that. And it's across as a gambit, it's across technology, across platform, across geographies or channels to market. And all those things, we're starting to see some opportunities. And as we get beyond this year and start to shape '17, we'll talk a bit more about where they start to -- where we're starting to see those opportunities come to fruition. What I'd rather do is talk about the one that we are actually achieving as we achieve them as opposed to speculating about where they might be. One last point on this, Howard, because I think it's a very important and I want to make sure investors don't miss this. It's not just about applying common technologies going after channels. The part of what we're doing in driving operational excellence and integration into across Exelis is improving program performance. This is very important. The best way to grow our business is performing well on what you're doing today. And in the note that -- in Rahul's prepared remarks, he talked about the sensor program. The sensor program is being recompleted because the performance was up with Air Force and through a lot of work, the on-time delivery of the program has improved dramatically. And now we're starting to get awards back on sensor and the competition has been canceled going to one of the pieces of sensor because of the improved performance. So I feel if we just keep focused on performance and executing very, very well, that will help us grow our business into the future as well."

We haven't changed it based on what's going on in the CapRock business. The energy business is still under a lot of pressure and the oil price have recovered a little bit, but still well down. A lot of the energy majors are reporting some pretty terrible numbers right now. For the year, we still expect CapRock Energy to be down about 25%. We were down in the 20% range-ish in the first half. They'll be worse than that obviously in the second half. As we get into Q4, we see the revenue in Q4 on CapRock Energy to be on the order of about $60 million in the quarter. So if you just annualize that, you're sort around $240 million for the year as we exit fiscal '16 and for perspective in fiscal '16 overall, revenue caprock energy was around to $90 million. So the math would imply that we'll see a little bit of another downturn on an annual basis in '17 over '16. '16 again is down about 25% from fiscal '15. So we are seeing another step down as we get into next year. But it's not different than what we described last time and did -- and built into our guidance for this year. I guess, as you saw the CM margins, we're down little bit sequentially. We did lose money in energy in Q3, but we've done quite a bit the restructuring as we laid out to investors back in February. And we do expect the energy business to go back to profitability in Q4 and be less of a profit driver as we get into fiscal '17."

Third quarter results were solid with operational earnings benefiting from the continuing ramp in synergy savings. Total company orders and revenue were sequentially higher, and book-to-bill was a very strong 1.12, driven by Space and Intelligence Systems, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks. We delivered good bottom line results, despite the impact of lower tactical radio revenue from the Middle East, demonstrating that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improve operating resiliency. 
Looking to the full year and the now-slower pace in the Middle East, together with a DoD tactical radio opportunity that has slipped into next year, we're adjusting our fiscal '16 earnings per share guidance to about $5.70, the bottom end of the prior range, on revenue of about $7.5 billion. Rahul will provide more color in a minute, but the only segment that's changing is Communication Systems, where we're now expecting legacy tactical revenue to be down high single digits with similar declines in both international and DoD. 
So let me start with a little color on what's driving the change. We started the year anticipating Harris legacy international of flat to down, even though we are coming off several years of strong expansion in international, including a record fiscal '15. But at the time, we had started to see some opportunities in the Middle East, market stretch out a bit. The first half of the year played out about as we thought, with international revenue up 5%, including higher revenue from the Middle East as a result of strong FMS funding support. And while we were expecting a year-over-year back-half decline in the Middle East, we anticipated sequential revenue growth. With the combination of fiscal pressures and funding priorities, both in-country and with the U.S. government as well as a slow FMS approval process, have shifted opportunities to the right. 
We believe the slow pace in the Middle East is temporary. Security issues and the need for more capable tactical communications are unchanged, and the FMS funding support remains strong for the region with additional money earmarked in the GFY '17 President's Budget request. 
In the U.S. tactical market, while our book-to-bill was above 1 in the quarter, MUOS upgrade opportunities expected in fiscal '16 are now unlikely to begin before the end of the year. While the MUOS capability is designed into our new 2-channel Manpack for the U.S. Army, what we've also adapted the wave form so that could be easily ported to a simple download into our 117G radios, 30,000 of which are currently fielded in DoD inventory. 
We've demonstrated connectivity between our radio and the satellite. We're on track to receive NSA certification shortly, and customers across several services are anxious to benefit from the mobility and higher bandwidth that the MUOS constellation provides. This is a very real and compelling value proposition for our customers, and funding for this opportunity has been earmarked in GFY '16. We anticipate this funding converting to an order for Harris before the end of September. 
So while fiscal '16 is a bit softer than expected in Tactical Communications, our outlook is solid and our competitive position has never been stronger. In the DoD, we've won or have a position on every major tactical radio contract awarded in the last 5 years: the mid-tier radio, MNVR, won in 2013; the Rifleman Radio, won last year; the SOCOM 2-channel handheld, won earlier this year; and most recently, the very large HMS Manpack, awarded in February. These are all significant wins for Harris, so let me update you on the latest developments. 
After more than 4 years of tenacious effort, the Army awarded Harris a 10-year $12.7 billion IDIQ contract for the multichannel Manpack radio, opening a market for Harris which had previously been closed to competition. Qualification and customer test are starting soon and scheduled to wrap up by the end of our fiscal '17, with the initial production delivery order award currently scheduled in early fiscal '18. The $3.7 billion Rifleman Radio procurement is also progressing well. We've now completed both qualification and customer tests, receiving positive feedback on operational capabilities, such as range and battery life. An initial production delivery order is expected in the second half of fiscal '17.
SOCOM's modernization is also moving forward, and a protest of Harris' single award for the $390 million 2-channel handheld radio program was recently resolved in our favor and work has begun. Product deliveries began in the first half of fiscal '18. This radio features both communications and ISR capabilities, and since SOCOM has long been an early adopter of cutting-edge technology that eventually finds its way into the broader DoD and international militaries, it positions us well to compete on a number of other modernization programs. The handheld is part of a broader modernization program that SOCOM is said to reach $900 million and include a new Manpack and HF radio. The Manpack RFP is expected late this summer and contract award before the end of fiscal '17, with the HF Radio following some time thereafter. 
On the international front, the pipeline remains about $2.9 billion and is diverse in terms of regions, countries and customers within a country. And while the near-term velocity has slowed a bit in the Middle East, continued progress is being made elsewhere. In the last earnings call, we mentioned that a $600 million opportunity for Australia's Phase 3 modernization had moved into the pipeline, with an award expected by the end of fiscal '17. We've now been selected as the preferred supplier with a significantly broader scope where Harris will now prime to deliver an integrated solution. This is a key part of our long-term growth strategy in international to expand our addressable market, leverage capabilities from across Harris and evolve from a radio supplier to now providing entire systems. 
Turning to a few highlights in other areas of the company. Both Space and Intel and Electronic Systems had strong orders, higher sequential and year-over-year organic revenue and book-to-bill greater than 1. Approximately 70% of Exelis' legacy business reside in these 2 segments and contributed to the positive sales and orders trend. 
In Space and Intel, awards from classified customers totaled $329 million, with continued strong budget support for intelligence programs and the ongoing customer focus on space superiority and protection capabilities. On the commercial space side, there are signs of a recapitalization cycle and fleet expansions beginning, and we recently received a $37 million order to provide an 18-meter unfurlable antenna reflector for the JCSAT-17 geostationary communications satellite. The prospects in our space antenna business are stronger today than they've been in the last decade. 
Within Electronic Systems, we enjoyed another quarter of strong electronic warfare bookings, including $88 million to supply electronic jammers for the F/A-18 aircraft, an excellent example of modernization opportunities on existing platforms with a very long tail. Electronic warfare is now on track in fiscal '16 to double orders over the prior year and end the year with about $200 million higher backlog. 
Strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging remain top priorities for Harris. And at the end of the third quarter, year-to-date free cash flow stood at $425 million, supporting expectations for the year of $750 million. On April 8, we completed the sale of Aerostructures and used the cash proceeds to pay down debt. So less than a year after closing the Exelis acquisition, we've repaid $683 million of term loan debt, which is approximately 1/3 of the total debt we've committed to repaying over 3 years. 
So now before turning the call over to Rahul Ghai, our new Chief Financial Officer, to cover the detailed financial results and guidance, I want to provide a brief introduction. 
As you already know, Rahul joined Harris in March of 2015 to lead the finance integration team and was named CFO in early February. By leading the finance integration team over the last year, Rahul has been essential to our integration success and has provided a smooth and natural transition to CFO. Rahul and I worked closely together for 5 of his 12 years at United Technologies, and again, over the past year as we've integrated Exelis. I'm confident in Rahul's ability to lead the Harris finance organization and be a true business partner to me and to the rest of the management team. 
So Rahul?"

Now turning to third quarter results and Slide 3 in the presentation. EPS was $1.45, with acquisition savings supporting operating performance and benefiting from a lower-than-expected tax rate in the quarter. Reported revenue was $1.91 billion compared to $1.19 billion in the prior year. On an organic basis, revenue was down 3%. Strong revenue growth in Space and Intelligence Systems and Electronic Systems was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services and International Tactical, in both legacy Harris and Exelis. Sequentially, revenue was up 3.6% with higher revenue across 3 of our 4 segments with the exception of the Communication Systems, where revenue was less than 1 point lower than revenue in the second quarter. 
EBIT margin for the company held strong at 16.4%, driven by excellent margin performance across all segments and reflecting continued focus on driving integration savings and lowering costs across the company. Orders in the quarter were $2.1 billion, bringing year-to-date book-to-bill to 1.06 company for the company and was greater than 1 in each segment in the third quarter, with the exception of Communication Systems. 
Within Communication Systems, third quarter book-to-bill for Tactical Communications was 0.8, with legacy Harris business at 0.83. And in the supplemental pages of the presentation, we have included historical order and backlog detail for legacy Harris tactical business. Public Safety book-to-bill was a bit disappointing at 0.5 and reflects that while the business is slowly improving with revenue up 15% in the quarter, we're not beyond the choppiness. 
In Space and Intelligence, order strength continued in the classified area. 
In Electronic Systems, orders were strong in electronic warfare and also in avionics, where we received $121 million in follow-on contracts for the F-35. 
In Critical Networks, FAA funding was a significant driver, and both CapRock energy and maritime reported book-to-bill of more than 1. 
For Harris overall, awards are on track to achieve a book-to-bill of 1 or close to 1 for the year. 
So turning to segment detail on Slide 4 and comparisons to prior year performance results as Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. 
Communication System third quarter revenue was $485 million and down 10%. Tactical Communication was down 16% and Public Safety was up 15% compared to the prior year. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower revenue in Middle East for both Harris and Exelis legacy businesses and completion of Australia's Phase 2 modernization program. Operating income was $154 million and operating margin was a strong 31.8%. 
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $489 million and up 7% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including programs in Space Superiority. Operating income in the third quarter was $76 million and operating margin was 15.5%. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded $81 million in follow-on contracts with $26 million ordered was sustained ground-based systems that support U.S. missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance missions from the Air Force for the SENSOR program. 
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $393 million and up 6.2% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from the F-35 program and counter IED systems was partially offset by lower revenue from Commercial Broadband Satellite Program terminals. Operating income in the third quarter was $75 million and operating margin was excellent at 19.1%. 
Just following the close of the quarter, we completed the sale of Aerostructures, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and reported within the Electronic Systems. While not material to Harris, we have included historical financial informations of Aerostructures for fiscal '15 and '16 in the supplemental section of the presentation. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue was $551 million and down 10% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset for lower revenue in IT Services from the wind down of 2 major programs and lower revenue in CapRock's energy market. Operating income in the third quarter was $59 million and operating margin was 10.7%. 
So moving to Slides 8 and 9. Total company revenue guidance, on an organic basis, is revised from down 5% to 6% to down about 7%, driven by lower revenue in Communication Systems. The impact of lower revenue is expected to be partially offset by cost savings across the company and lower taxes. As a result, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be approximately $5.70, the lower end of the previous guidance range. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be down between 8% to 9%, with Harris legacy tactical down in single digits. With lower volume for the year, operating margin is expected to be about 29% in the segment, which is at the lower end of the previous range. 
In Electronic Systems, expectations remain unchanged with the exception of removing Aerostructures for the remainder of the year. With Aerostructures removed, revenue was revised to a range of down 3% to 4% and is equivalent to the previous organic expectations of down 2% to 3%. Operating margin is unchanged at 18% to 19%. And in Space and Intelligence and Critical Networks, expectations remain unchanged. 
The expected tax rate for fiscal '16 has been revised from 32.5% to 31% due to international tax settlements for prior years and from integration steps that have lowered state taxes. Beyond fiscal '16, we expect to benefit from lower state taxes and permanent R&D tax credit. 
So let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

We're executing well on the integration, and the results are benefiting from synergy capture. 
From Day 1 of integration, we've been tracking a little ahead of schedule and reaching integration targets, which is a great achievement from the team. So as we maneuvered through pockets of revenue softness, it's evident that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improved operating resiliency. With less than a year into the acquisition, achieving our current expectation of about 11% earnings growth is a good outcome. 
Looking ahead, we expect fiscal '16's rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal '17, supported by higher synergy savings and other cost reduction actions. In the meantime, we'll continue to gain traction in our multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis, lower cost and deliver accretion, shape our business portfolio, drive strong free cash flow and deleverage, all while still investing in technology and new product development to drive future growth. 
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

We're not -- we'll come to that in early August. But I think when you talk about communications, you sound -- your question seems more direct towards the tactical side, which as we know, has been more of the important earnings driver. So we're not going to provide some guidance today, but there's several things that are on our radar screen that we'd like to see happen in the near term that will help us shape some of the guidance will provide in early August. In the DoD side, both MUOS and the MNVR radio, the mid-tier radio, together will contribute to higher earnings, higher revenue in fiscal '17. MUOS, which did slip out of the quarter, is we expect to receive certifications on that this summer, an NSA certification. We've already demonstrated on-air performance for both voice and data. It's well supported. Funds are allocated. And it's a very strong and compelling business case, and we're very proud [ph] if that's going to happen over the next several months. On the mid-tier side, on the MNVR, that will be in the tens of millions of dollars. It's well supported in the President's Budget request as well as in the NDAA that just came out. The network assessment is going on as we speak. And we expect a production award towards the end of government fiscal year '16, so around the September timeframe. I think on the international side, which has become a bigger part of our business and is a very large pipeline, we're looking at what's occurring in Eastern Europe and the Ukraine, where we've been very, very strong in fiscal '16. We need that to continue. We need to see the opportunities that we've seen very well in Iraq in fiscal '16. We expect that to continue at the same level as we've see in '16. And again, opportunities in Iraq to us, as we speak today, seem to be well supported. One of the opportunities in international had slipped out of fiscal '16 into '17 is in Iraq, but is well funded. We think that, that's going to happen in the '17. There's another country in the Middle East -- we can't name where an opportunity did slip out, and we expect that'll happen in early '17 as well. And then finally, in Central Asia, meaning specifically Afghanistan, we've had a very strong year this year. Opportunities there seem well supported. And we do expect Afghanistan, and more broadly, Central Asia to be a strong contributor to revenue into next year. Now outside of Tactical Communication, we have a broader business -- outside of legacy tactical, we have a broader communications business, including Exelis, the radio business from Exelis, which is mostly international. We've been tracking an opportunity in Saudi Arabia for quite some time. It's about $40 million, $50 million in size for SINCGARS radios for vehicles. It's been hung up in the Saudi Royal Court for a number of months, and we need that to break free as we get into '17 as well. So maybe Pete, just a little bit of shape and color around what we expect going into next year."

But Howard, as I step back, we are at the heart, a technology-based company, really in defense electronics, mission critical communications, and we want to be in businesses where technology is a discriminator, add some competitive advantage. We spend quite a bit on IRAD [indiscernible] and 4% is well above our peers, 4% of our revenue.

We're closing about 15% of our floor space, and that's tracking very, very well. So that has been our #1 focus. And that's how we justify the acquisition. It was really on cost take out. On the revenue side, yes, there -- we've got our teams really focused on this. Dana Mehnert, who's been here at Harris for more than 30 years and really built our Tactical Radio business into what it is today, has now taken on a role as Head of Global Business Development, really with an eye towards how do we grow in major markets around the world where the opportunities might be a little bit outside of the horizon or between businesses or might involve bringing together, strapping together, some technology from Exelis with Harris. And this focus is really on that. And it's across -- as a again, it's across technology, across platforms, across geographies or channels to market. And all those things, we're starting to see some opportunities. And as we get beyond this year and start to shape '17, we'll talk a bit more about where they start to -- where we're starting to see those opportunities come to fruition. What I'd rather do is talk about the one that we are actually achieving as we achieve them as opposed to speculating about where they might be. One last point on this, Howard, because I think this is very important, and I want to make sure investors don't miss this. It's not just about applying common technologies, going after channels. The part of what we're doing in driving operational excellence and integration into -- across Exelis is improving program performance. This is very important. The best way to grow our business is performing well on what you're doing today. And in the note that -- in Rahul's prepared remarks, he talked about the SENSOR program. The SENSOR program was being recompleted because the performance wasn't quite up to snuff with the Air Force. And through a lot of work, the on-time delivery of the program has improved dramatically. And now we're starting to get awards back on SENSOR. And the competition has been canceled, going to one of the pieces of SENSOR because of the improved performance. So I feel if we just keep focused on performance and executing very, very well, that'll help us grow our business into the future as well."

I feel very confident that the DoD business will be a growth driver for us, certainly as we get into '18 and beyond. '17 is a little bit too soon to call. I do see it coming off the bottom in '16 into '17, but I think '18 is really the growth year. And I think it really relates to the flow-in from some of these modernization programs where we're very, very, very well-positioned, including in SOCOM. So the DoD, I think, clearly is a growth driver. On the international side, we've seen fantastic growth over the last few years. We've seen a little bit of softness this year. The pipeline is still very robust. We are still well positioned. Competitively, we're very strong. Where we are going out to compete, we win, almost all the places that we are competing in around the world where we have a position. I think the opportunity in Australia, where we've become the preferred supplier for a very large contract, would include systems and products, is an important part of our strategy because we need to increase the size of the addressable market we're going after in international in order to continue to see growth in that international base over time.

We haven't changed it based on what's going on in the CapRock business. The energy business is still under a lot of pressure, and the oil prices have recovered a little bit, but still well down. A lot of the energy majors are reporting some pretty terrible numbers right now. For the year, we still expect CapRock energy to be down about 25%. We were down in the 20% range-ish in the first half, and it will be worse than that, obviously, in the second half. As we get into Q4, we see the revenue in Q4 at CapRock energy to be on the order of about $60 million in the quarter. So if you just annualize that, you're sort around $240 million for the year as we exit fiscal '16. And for perspective, in fiscal '16, overall, revenue caprock energy was around to $290 million. So the math would imply that we'll see a little bit of another downturn on an annual basis in '17 over '16. '16 again is down about 25% from fiscal '15. So we are seeing another step down as we get into next year. But it's not different than what we described last time, and did -- and built into our guidance for this year. I guess, as you saw the CN margins, we're down little bit sequentially. We did lose money in energy in Q3, but we've done quite a bit of restructuring as we laid out to investors back in February. And we do expect the energy business to go back to profitability in Q4 and be less of a profit driver as we get into fiscal '17."

That's something we've been working on for quite some time in the U.S. The U.S. Military tends to do their own systems integration. They manage each of the suppliers and the components and then integrate it together. And test it through what we're seeing today in these network evaluations, in these NIEs. On the international side, more and more customers are moving towards buying an installed solution, an integrated solution. And that's, I think, a good trend that's heading in our direction. We feel very good that the radio itself is very, very competitive and provides a key source of value, and we think we can broaden that and bring other partners on to our team. In fact, that's exactly what we've been able to do in Australia, some very important large global players are on the Harris team in Australia, providing components to us. And what that does is you not just provide a radio but software and other components around that. It does continue to build more stickiness into that end customer coming back to Harris Corporation over time. So we feel very good about the trajectory we happen to be on in the systems and integrated solution side internationally."

Third quarter results were solid with operational earnings benefiting from the continuing ramp in synergy savings. Total company orders and revenue were sequentially higher, and book-to-bill was a very strong 1.12, driven by Space and Intelligence Systems, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks. We delivered good bottom line results, despite the impact of lower tactical radio revenue from the Middle East, demonstrating that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improved operating resiliency. 
Looking to the full year and the now-slower pace in the Middle East, together with a DoD tactical radio opportunity that has slipped into next year, we're adjusting our fiscal '16 earnings per share guidance to about $5.70, the bottom end of the prior range, on revenue of about $7.5 billion. Rahul will provide more color in a minute, but the only segment that's changing is Communication Systems, where we're now expecting legacy tactical revenue to be down high single digits with similar declines in both international and DoD. 
So let me start with a little color on what's driving the change. We started the year anticipating Harris legacy international of flat to down, even though we are coming off several years of strong expansion in international, including a record fiscal '15. But at the time we had started to see some opportunities in the Middle East market stretch out a bit. The first half of the year played out about as we thought, with international revenue up 5%, including higher revenue from the Middle East as a result of strong FMS funding support. And while we were expecting a year-over-year back-half decline in the Middle East, we anticipated sequential revenue growth. But the combination of fiscal pressures and funding priorities, both in-country and with the U.S. government, as well as a slow FMS approval process, have shifted opportunities to the right. 
We believe the slow pace in the Middle East is temporary. Security issues and the need for more capable tactical communications are unchanged, and the FMS funding support remains strong for the region with additional money earmarked in the GFY '17 President's Budget request. 
In the U.S. tactical market, while our book-to-bill was above 1 in the quarter, MUOS upgrade opportunities expected in fiscal '16 are now unlikely to begin before the end of the year. While the MUOS capability is designed into our new 2-channel Manpack for the U.S. Army, we've also adapted the waveform so that could be easily ported through a simple download into our 117G radios, 30,000 of which are currently fielded in DoD inventory. 
We've demonstrated connectivity between our radio and the satellite. We're on track to receive NSA certification shortly, and customers across several services are anxious to benefit from the mobility and higher bandwidth that the MUOS constellation provides. This is a very real and compelling value proposition for our customers, and funding for this opportunity has been earmarked in GFY '16. We anticipate this funding converting to an order for Harris before the end of September. 
So while fiscal '16 is a bit softer than expected in Tactical Communications, our outlook is solid and our competitive position has never been stronger. In the DoD, we've won or have a position on every major tactical radio contract awarded in the last 5 years: the mid-tier radio, MNVR, won in 2013; the Rifleman Radio won last year; the SOCOM 2-channel handheld won earlier this year; and most recently, the very large HMS Manpack, awarded in February. These are all significant wins for Harris, so let me update you on the latest developments. 
After more than 4 years of tenacious effort, the Army awarded Harris a 10-year, $12.7 billion IDIQ contract for the multichannel Manpack radio, opening a market for Harris which had previously been closed to competition. Qualification and customer tests are starting soon and scheduled to wrap up by the end of our fiscal '17, with the initial production delivery order award currently scheduled in early fiscal '18. The $3.7 billion Rifleman Radio procurement is also progressing well. We've now completed both qualification and customer tests, receiving positive feedback on operational capabilities such as range and battery life. An initial production delivery order is expected in the second half of fiscal '17.
SOCOM's modernization is also moving forward, and a protest of Harris' single award for the $390 million 2-channel handheld radio program was recently resolved in our favor and work has begun. Product deliveries begin in the first half of fiscal '18. This radio features both communications and ISR capabilities, and since SOCOM has long been an early adopter of cutting-edge technology that eventually finds its way into the broader DoD and international militaries, it positions us well to compete on a number of other modernization programs. The handheld is part of a broader modernization program that SOCOM has said could reach $900 million and include a new Manpack and HF radio. The Manpack RFP is expected late this summer and contract award before the end of fiscal '17, with the HF Radio following some time thereafter. 
On the international front, the pipeline remains about $2.9 billion and is diverse in terms of regions, countries and customers within a country. And while the near-term velocity has slowed a bit in the Middle East, continued progress is being made elsewhere. In the last earnings call we mentioned that a $600 million opportunity for Australia's Phase 3 modernization had moved into the pipeline, with an award expected by the end of fiscal '17. We've now been selected as the preferred supplier with a significantly broader scope, where Harris will now prime to deliver an integrated solution. This is a key part of our long-term growth strategy in international: to expand our addressable market, leverage capabilities from across Harris and evolve from a radio supplier to now providing entire systems. 
Turning to a few highlights in other areas of the company. Both Space and Intel and Electronic Systems had strong orders, higher sequential and year-over-year organic revenue and book-to-bill greater than 1. Approximately 70% of Exelis' legacy business reside in these 2 segments and contributed to the positive sales and orders trend. 
In Space and Intel, awards from classified customers totaled $329 million, with continued strong budget support for intelligence programs and the ongoing customer focus on space superiority and protection capabilities. On the commercial space side, there are signs of a recapitalization cycle and fleet expansions beginning, and we recently received a $37 million order to provide an 18-meter unfurlable antenna reflector for the JCSAT-17 geostationary communications satellite. The prospects in our space antenna business are stronger today than they've been in the last decade. 
Within Electronic Systems, we enjoyed another quarter of strong electronic warfare bookings, including $88 million to supply electronic jammers for the F/A-18 aircraft, an excellent example of modernization opportunities on existing platforms with a very long tail. Electronic warfare is now on track in fiscal '16 to double orders over the prior year and end the year with about $200 million higher backlog. 
Strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging remain top priorities for Harris. And at the end of the third quarter, year-to-date free cash flow stood at $425 million, supporting expectations for the year of $750 million. On April 8, we completed the sale of Aerostructures and used the cash proceeds to pay down debt. So less than a year after closing the Exelis acquisition, we've repaid $683 million of term loan debt, which is approximately 1/3 of the total debt we've committed to repaying over 3 years. 
So now, before turning the call over to Rahul Ghai, our new Chief Financial Officer, to cover the detailed financial results and guidance, I want to provide a brief introduction. 
As you already know, Rahul joined Harris in March of 2015 to lead the finance integration team and was named CFO in early February. By leading the finance integration team over the last year, Rahul has been essential to our integration success and has provided a smooth and natural transition to CFO. Rahul and I worked closely together for 5 of his 12 years at United Technologies and again over the past year as we integrated Exelis. I'm confident in Rahul's ability to lead the Harris finance organization and be a true business partner to me and to the rest of the management team. 
So Rahul?"

Now turning to third quarter results and Slide 3 in the presentation. EPS was $1.45, with acquisition savings supporting operating performance and benefiting from a lower-than-expected tax rate in the quarter. Reported revenue was $1.91 billion compared to $1.19 billion in the prior year. On an organic basis, revenue was down 3%. Strong revenue growth in Space and Intelligence Systems and Electronic Systems was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services and International Tactical, in both legacy Harris and Exelis. Sequentially, revenue was up 3.6% with higher revenue across 3 of our 4 segments with the exception of Communication Systems, where revenue was less than 1 point lower than revenue in the second quarter. 
EBIT margin for the company held strong at 16.4%, driven by excellent margin performance across all segments and reflecting continued focus on driving integration savings and lowering costs across the company. Orders in the quarter were $2.1 billion, bringing year-to-date book-to-bill to 1.06 company for the company and was greater than 1 in each segment in the third quarter, with the exception of Communication Systems. 
Within Communication Systems, third quarter book-to-bill for Tactical Communications was 0.8, with legacy Harris business at 0.83. And in the supplemental pages of the presentation, we have included historical order and backlog detail for legacy Harris tactical business. Public Safety book-to-bill was a bit disappointing at 0.5 and reflects that while the business is slowly improving with revenue up 15% in the quarter, we're not beyond the choppiness. 
In Space and Intelligence, order strength continued in the classified area. 
In Electronic Systems, orders were strong in electronic warfare and also in avionics, where we received $121 million in follow-on contracts for the F-35. 
In Critical Networks, FAA funding was a significant driver, and both CapRock energy and maritime reported book-to-bill of more than 1. 
For Harris overall, awards are on track to achieve a book-to-bill of 1 or close to 1 for the year. 
So turning to segment detail on Slide 4 and comparisons to prior year performance results as Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. 
Communication System third quarter revenue was $485 million and down 10%. Tactical Communication revenue was down 16% and Public Safety was up 15% compared to the prior year. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower revenue in Middle East for both Harris and Exelis legacy businesses and completion of Australia's Phase 2 modernization program. Operating income was $154 million and operating margin was a strong 31.8%. 
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $489 million and up 7% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including programs in Space Superiority. Operating income in the third quarter was $76 million and operating margin was 15.5%. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded $81 million in follow-on contracts with $26 million ordered for sustained ground-based systems that support U.S. missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance missions from the Air Force for the SENSOR program. 
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $393 million and up 6.2% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from the F-35 program and counter-IED systems was partially offset by lower revenue from Commercial Broadband Satellite Program terminals. Operating income in the third quarter was $75 million and operating margin was excellent at 19.1%. 
Just following the close of the quarter, we completed the sale of Aerostructures, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and reported within Electronic Systems. While not material to Harris, we have included historical financial information of Aerostructures for fiscal '15 and '16 in the supplemental section of the presentation. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue was $551 million and down 10% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services from the
wind-down of 2 major programs and lower revenue in CapRock's energy market. Operating income in the third quarter was $59 million and operating margin was 10.7%. 
So moving to Slides 8 and 9. Total company revenue guidance on an organic basis is revised from down 5% to 6% to down about 7%, driven by lower revenue in Communication Systems. The impact of lower revenue is expected to be partially offset by cost savings across the company and lower taxes. As a result, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be approximately $5.70, the lower end of the previous guidance range. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be down between 8% to 9%, with Harris legacy tactical down high single digits. With lower volume for the year, operating margin is expected to be about 29% in the segment, which is at the lower end of the previous range. 
In Electronic Systems, expectations remain unchanged, with the exception of removing Aerostructures for the remainder of the year. With Aerostructures removed, revenue was revised to a range of down 3% to 4% and is equivalent to the previous organic expectations of down 2% to 3%. Operating margin is unchanged at 18% to 19%. And in Space and Intelligence and Critical Networks, expectations remain unchanged. 
The expected tax rate for fiscal '16 has been revised from 32.5% to 31% due to international tax settlements for prior years and from integration steps that have lowered state taxes. Beyond fiscal '16, we expect to benefit from lower state taxes and [indiscernible] R&D tax credit. 
So let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

We're executing well on the integration, and our results are benefiting from synergy capture. 
From Day 1 of integration, we've been tracking a little ahead of schedule and reaching integration targets, which is a great achievement from the team. So as we maneuver through pockets of revenue softness, it's evident that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improved operating resiliency. With less than a year into the acquisition, achieving our current expectation of about 11% earnings growth is a good outcome. 
Looking ahead, we expect fiscal '16's rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal '17, supported by higher synergy savings and other cost reduction actions. In the meantime, we'll continue to gain traction in our multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis, lower costs and deliver accretion, shape our business portfolio, drive strong free cash flow and deleverage, all while still investing in technology and new product development to drive future growth.

So we're not going to provide some guidance today, but there's several things that are on our radar screen that we'd like to see happen in the near term that will help to shape some of the guidance we'll provide in early August. 
In the DoD side, both MUOS and the MNVR radio, the mid-tier radio, together will contribute to higher earnings, higher revenue in fiscal '17. MUOS, which did slip out of the quarter, we expect to receive certifications on that this summer, NSA certification. We've already demonstrated on-air performance for both voice and data. It's well supported. Funds are allocated. It's a very strong and compelling business case, and we're very [indiscernible] that that's going to happen over the next several months. 
On the mid-tier side, on the MNVR, that will be in the tens of millions of dollars. It's well supported in the President's budget request as well as in the NDAA that just came out. The network assessment is going on as we speak. And we expect a production award towards the end of the government fiscal year '16, so around the September timeframe. 
I think on the international side, which has become a bigger part of our business and is a very large pipeline, we're looking at what's occurring in Eastern Europe and the Ukraine, where we've been very, very strong in fiscal '16. We need that to continue. We need to see the opportunities that we've seen very well in Iraq in fiscal '16. We expect that to continue at the same level as we've seen in '16. And again, opportunities in Iraq to us, as we speak today, seem to be well supported. One of the opportunities in international that had slipped out of fiscal '16 into '17 is in Iraq but is well funded. We think that, that's going to happen in '17. There's another country in the Middle East we can't name where an opportunity did slip out, and we expect that'll happen in early '17 as well. 
And then finally, in Central Asia, meaning specifically Afghanistan, we've had a very strong year this year. Opportunities there seem well supported. And we do expect Afghanistan and more broadly Central Asia to be a strong contributor to revenue into next year. Now outside of Tactical Communications, we have a broader business -- outside of legacy tactical we have a broader communications business, including Exelis, the radio business from Exelis, which is mostly international. We've been tracking an opportunity in Saudi Arabia for quite some time. It's about $40 million, $50 million in size for SINCGARS radios for vehicles. It's been hung up in the Saudi Royal Court for a number of months, and we need that to break free as we get into '17 as well. So maybe, Pete, just a little bit of shape and color around what we expect going into next year."

We're closing about 15% of our floor space, and that's tracking very, very well. So that has been our #1 focus. And that's how we justified the acquisition. It was really on cost take-out. 
On the revenue side, yes, there -- we've got our teams really focused on this. Dana Mehnert, who's been here at Harris for more than 30 years and really built our Tactical Radio business into what it is today, has now taken on a role as Head of Global Business Development, really with an eye towards how do we grow in major markets around the world where the opportunities might be a little bit outside of the horizon or between businesses or might involve bringing together, strapping together some technology from Exelis with Harris. And his focus is really on that. And it's across the gamut. It's across technology, across platforms, across geographies or channels to market. In all those things we're starting to see some opportunities. 
And as we get beyond this year and start to shape '17 we'll talk a bit more about where they start to -- where we're starting to see those opportunities come to fruition. What I'd rather do is talk about the ones that we are actually achieving as we achieve them as opposed to speculating about where they might be. 
One last point on this, Howard, because I think this is very important, and I want to make sure investors don't miss this. It's not just about applying common technologies, going after channels. But part of what we're doing in driving operational excellence and integration into -- across Exelis is improving program performance. This is very important. The best way to grow a business is performing well on what you're doing today. And in the note that -- in Rahul's prepared remarks, he talked about the SENSOR program. The SENSOR program was being recompeted because the performance wasn't quite up to snuff with the Air Force. And through a lot of work, the on-time delivery of the program has improved dramatically. And now we're starting to get awards back on SENSOR. And the competition has been canceled, going to one of the pieces of SENSOR, because of the improved performance. So I feel if we just keep focused on performance and executing very, very well, that'll help us grow our business into the future as well."

And that data can be used in other forms for other uses, including supporting the integration of UAVs into the North American air traffic control system. That is a key part of our strategy. That's an opportunity that's likely beyond the next couple, 3-year planning horizon. But clearly, through both technology partnerships and legislation, all of which need to be worked on today to make sure we've got a strong position there over time.

'17 is a little bit too soon to call. I do see it coming off the bottom in '16 into '17. But I think '18 is really the growth year. And I think it really relates to the flow-in from some of these modernization programs where we're very, very, well-positioned, including in SOCOM. So the DoD I think clearly is a growth driver. 
On the international side, we've seen fantastic growth over the last few years. We've seen a little bit of softness this year. The pipeline is still very robust. We are still well positioned. Competitively we're very strong. Where we are going out to compete we win, almost all the places that we are competing in around the world where we have a position. I think the opportunity in Australia, where we've become the preferred supplier for a very large contract which includes systems and products, is an important part of our strategy because we need to increase the size of the addressable market we're going after in international in order to continue to see growth in that international base over time.

The energy business is still under a lot of pressure. And oil prices have recovered a little bit, but still well down. A lot of the energy majors are reporting some pretty terrible numbers right now. For the year we still expect CapRock energy to be down about 25%. We were down in the 20% range-ish in the first half, and it will be worse than that, obviously, in the second half. As we get into Q4, we see the revenue in Q4 in CapRock energy to be on the order of about $60 million in the quarter. So if you just annualize that, you're sort of around $240 million for the year as we exit fiscal '16. 
And for perspective, in fiscal '16 overall, revenue in CapRock energy was around $290 million. So the math would imply that we'll see a little bit of another downturn on an annual basis in '17 over '16. '16, again, is down about 25% from fiscal '15. So we are seeing another step down as we get into next year. But it's not different than what we described last time and did -- and built into our guidance for this year. I guess, as you saw the CN margins, we're down a little bit sequentially. We did lose money in energy in Q3, but we've done quite a bit of restructuring, as we laid out to investors back in February, and we do expect the energy business to go back to profitability in Q4 and be less of a profit driver as we get into fiscal '17."

Total company orders and revenue were sequentially higher, and book-to-bill was a very strong 1.12, driven by Space and Intelligence Systems, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks. We delivered good bottom line results, despite the impact of lower tactical radio revenue from the Middle East, demonstrating that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improved operating resiliency. 
Looking to the full year and the now-slower pace in the Middle East, together with a DoD tactical radio opportunity that has slipped into next year, we're adjusting our fiscal '16 earnings per share guidance to about $5.70, the bottom end of the prior range, on revenue of about $7.5 billion. Rahul will provide more color in a minute, but the only segment that's changing is Communication Systems, where we're now expecting legacy tactical revenue to be down high single digits with similar declines in both international and DoD. 
So let me start with a little color on what's driving the change. We started the year anticipating Harris legacy international of flat to down, even though we are coming off several years of strong expansion in international, including a record fiscal '15. But at the time we had started to see some opportunities in the Middle East market stretch out a bit. The first half of the year played out about as we thought, with international revenue up 5%, including higher revenue from the Middle East as a result of strong FMS funding support. And while we were expecting a year-over-year back-half decline in the Middle East, we anticipated sequential revenue growth. But the combination of fiscal pressures and funding priorities, both in-country and with the U.S. government, as well as a slow FMS approval process, have shifted opportunities to the right. 
We believe the slow pace in the Middle East is temporary. Security issues and the need for more capable tactical communications are unchanged, and the FMS funding support remains strong for the region with additional money earmarked in the GFY '17 President's Budget request. 
In the U.S. tactical market, while our book-to-bill was above 1 in the quarter, MUOS upgrade opportunities expected in fiscal '16 are now unlikely to begin before the end of the year. While the MUOS capability is designed into our new 2-channel Manpack for the U.S. Army, we've also adapted the waveform so that could be easily ported through a simple download into our 117G radios, 30,000 of which are currently fielded in DoD inventory. 
We've demonstrated connectivity between our radio and the satellite. We're on track to receive NSA certification shortly, and customers across several services are anxious to benefit from the mobility and higher bandwidth that the MUOS constellation provides. This is a very real and compelling value proposition for our customers, and funding for this opportunity has been earmarked in GFY '16. We anticipate this funding converting to an order for Harris before the end of September. 
So while fiscal '16 is a bit softer than expected in Tactical Communications, our outlook is solid and our competitive position has never been stronger. In the DoD, we've won or have a position on every major tactical radio contract awarded in the last 5 years: the mid-tier radio, MNVR, won in 2013; the Rifleman Radio won last year; the SOCOM 2-channel handheld won earlier this year; and most recently, the very large HMS Manpack, awarded in February. These are all significant wins for Harris, so let me update you on the latest developments. 
After more than 4 years of tenacious effort, the Army awarded Harris a 10-year, $12.7 billion IDIQ contract for the multichannel Manpack radio, opening a market for Harris which had previously been closed to competition. Qualification and customer tests are starting soon and scheduled to wrap up by the end of our fiscal '17, with the initial production delivery order award currently scheduled in early fiscal '18. The $3.7 billion Rifleman Radio procurement is also progressing well. We've now completed both qualification and customer tests, receiving positive feedback on operational capabilities such as range and battery life. An initial production delivery order is expected in the second half of fiscal '17.
SOCOM's modernization is also moving forward, and a protest of Harris' single award for the $390 million 2-channel handheld radio program was recently resolved in our favor and work has begun. Product deliveries begin in the first half of fiscal '18. This radio features both communications and ISR capabilities, and since SOCOM has long been an early adopter of cutting-edge technology that eventually finds its way into the broader DoD and international militaries, it positions us well to compete on a number of other modernization programs. The handheld is part of a broader modernization program that SOCOM has said could reach $900 million and include a new Manpack and HF radio. The Manpack RFP is expected late this summer and contract award before the end of fiscal '17, with the HF Radio following some time thereafter. 
On the international front, the pipeline remains about $2.9 billion and is diverse in terms of regions, countries and customers within a country. And while the near-term velocity has slowed a bit in the Middle East, continued progress is being made elsewhere. In the last earnings call we mentioned that a $600 million opportunity for Australia's Phase 3 modernization had moved into the pipeline, with an award expected by the end of fiscal '17. We've now been selected as the preferred supplier with a significantly broader scope, where Harris will now prime to deliver an integrated solution. This is a key part of our long-term growth strategy in international: to expand our addressable market, leverage capabilities from across Harris and evolve from a radio supplier to now providing entire systems. 
Turning to a few highlights in other areas of the company. Both Space and Intel and Electronic Systems had strong orders, higher sequential and year-over-year organic revenue and book-to-bill greater than 1. Approximately 70% of Exelis' legacy business reside in these 2 segments and contributed to the positive sales and orders trend. 
In Space and Intel, awards from classified customers totaled $329 million, with continued strong budget support for intelligence programs and the ongoing customer focus on space superiority and protection capabilities. On the commercial space side, there are signs of a recapitalization cycle and fleet expansions beginning, and we recently received a $37 million order to provide an 18-meter unfurlable antenna reflector for the JCSAT-17 geostationary communications satellite. The prospects in our space antenna business are stronger today than they've been in the last decade. 
Within Electronic Systems, we enjoyed another quarter of strong electronic warfare bookings, including $88 million to supply electronic jammers for the F/A-18 aircraft, an excellent example of modernization opportunities on existing platforms with a very long tail. Electronic warfare is now on track in fiscal '16 to double orders over the prior year and end the year with about $200 million higher backlog. 
Strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging remain top priorities for Harris. And at the end of the third quarter, year-to-date free cash flow stood at $425 million, supporting expectations for the year of $750 million. On April 8, we completed the sale of Aerostructures and used the cash proceeds to pay down debt. So less than a year after closing the Exelis acquisition, we've repaid $683 million of term loan debt, which is approximately 1/3 of the total debt we've committed to repaying over 3 years. 
So now, before turning the call over to Rahul Ghai, our new Chief Financial Officer, to cover the detailed financial results and guidance, I want to provide a brief introduction. 
As you already know, Rahul joined Harris in March of 2015 to lead the finance integration team and was named CFO in early February. By leading the finance integration team over the last year, Rahul has been essential to our integration success and has provided a smooth and natural transition to CFO. Rahul and I worked closely together for 5 of his 12 years at United Technologies and again over the past year as we integrated Exelis. I'm confident in Rahul's ability to lead the Harris finance organization and be a true business partner to me and to the rest of the management team. 
So Rahul?"

Now turning to third quarter results and Slide 3 in the presentation. EPS was $1.45, with acquisition savings supporting operating performance and benefiting from a lower-than-expected tax rate in the quarter. Reported revenue was $1.91 billion compared to $1.19 billion in the prior year. On an organic basis, revenue was down 3%. Strong revenue growth in Space and Intelligence Systems and Electronic Systems was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services and International Tactical, in both legacy Harris and Exelis. Sequentially, revenue was up 3.6% with higher revenue across 3 of our 4 segments with the exception of Communication Systems, where revenue was less than 1 point lower than revenue in the second quarter. 
EBIT margin for the company held strong at 16.4%, driven by excellent margin performance across all segments and reflecting continued focus on driving integration savings and lowering costs across the company. Orders in the quarter were $2.1 billion, bringing year-to-date book-to-bill to 1.06 company for the company and was greater than 1 in each segment in the third quarter, with the exception of Communication Systems. 
Within Communication Systems, third quarter book-to-bill for Tactical Communications was 0.8, with legacy Harris business at 0.83. And in the supplemental pages of the presentation, we have included historical order and backlog detail for legacy Harris tactical business. Public Safety book-to-bill was a bit disappointing at 0.5 and reflects that while the business is slowly improving with revenue up 15% in the quarter, we're not beyond the choppiness. 
In Space and Intelligence, order strength continued in the classified area. 
In Electronic Systems, orders were strong in electronic warfare and also in avionics, where we received $121 million in follow-on contracts for the F-35. 
In Critical Networks, FAA funding was a significant driver, and both CapRock energy and maritime reported book-to-bill of more than 1. 
For Harris overall, awards are on track to achieve a book-to-bill of 1 or close to 1 for the year. 
So turning to segment detail on Slide 4 and comparisons to prior year performance results as Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. 
Communication System third quarter revenue was $485 million and down 10%. Tactical Communication revenue was down 16% and Public Safety was up 15% compared to the prior year. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower revenue in Middle East for both Harris and Exelis legacy businesses and completion of Australia's Phase 2 modernization program. Operating income was $154 million and operating margin was a strong 31.8%. 
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $489 million and up 7% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including programs in Space Superiority. Operating income in the third quarter was $76 million and operating margin was 15.5%. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded $81 million in follow-on contracts with $26 million ordered for sustained ground-based systems that support U.S. missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance missions from the Air Force for the SENSOR program. 
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $393 million and up 6.2% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from the F-35 program and counter-IED systems was partially offset by lower revenue from Commercial Broadband Satellite Program terminals. Operating income in the third quarter was $75 million and operating margin was excellent at 19.1%. 
Just following the close of the quarter, we completed the sale of Aerostructures, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and reported within Electronic Systems. While not material to Harris, we have included historical financial information of Aerostructures for fiscal '15 and '16 in the supplemental section of the presentation. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue was $551 million and down 10% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services from the
wind-down of 2 major programs and lower revenue in CapRock's energy market. Operating income in the third quarter was $59 million and operating margin was 10.7%. 
So moving to Slides 8 and 9. Total company revenue guidance on an organic basis is revised from down 5% to 6% to down about 7%, driven by lower revenue in Communication Systems. The impact of lower revenue is expected to be partially offset by cost savings across the company and lower taxes. As a result, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be approximately $5.70, the lower end of the previous guidance range. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be down between 8% to 9%, with Harris legacy tactical down high single digits. With lower volume for the year, operating margin is expected to be about 29% in the segment, which is at the lower end of the previous range. 
In Electronic Systems, expectations remain unchanged, with the exception of removing Aerostructures for the remainder of the year. With Aerostructures removed, revenue was revised to a range of down 3% to 4% and is equivalent to the previous organic expectations of down 2% to 3%. Operating margin is unchanged at 18% to 19%. And in Space and Intelligence and Critical Networks, expectations remain unchanged. 
The expected tax rate for fiscal '16 has been revised from 32.5% to 31% due to international tax settlements for prior years and from integration steps that have lowered state taxes. Beyond fiscal '16, we expect to benefit from lower state taxes and [indiscernible] R&D tax credit. 
So let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."
177934,331407861,971619,"Harris Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Rahul.

We're executing well on the integration, and our results are benefiting from synergy capture. 
From Day 1 of integration, we've been tracking a little ahead of schedule and reaching integration targets, which is a great achievement from the team. So as we maneuver through pockets of revenue softness, it's evident that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improved operating resiliency. With less than a year into the acquisition, achieving our current expectation of about 11% earnings growth is a good outcome. 
Looking ahead, we expect fiscal '16's rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal '17, supported by higher synergy savings and other cost reduction actions. In the meantime, we'll continue to gain traction in our multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis, lower costs and deliver accretion, shape our business portfolio, drive strong free cash flow and deleverage, all while still investing in technology and new product development to drive future growth. 
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

But I think when you talk about communications you sound -- your question seems more direct towards the tactical side, which, as we know, has been more the important earnings driver. So we're not going to provide some guidance today, but there's several things that are on our radar screen that we'd like to see happen in the near term that will help to shape some of the guidance we'll provide in early August. 
In the DoD side, both MUOS and the MNVR radio, the mid-tier radio, together will contribute to higher earnings, higher revenue in fiscal '17. MUOS, which did slip out of the quarter, we expect to receive certifications on that this summer, NSA certification. We've already demonstrated on-air performance for both voice and data. It's well supported. Funds are allocated. It's a very strong and compelling business case, and we're very [indiscernible] that that's going to happen over the next several months. 
On the mid-tier side, on the MNVR, that will be in the tens of millions of dollars. It's well supported in the President's budget request as well as in the NDAA that just came out. The network assessment is going on as we speak. And we expect a production award towards the end of the government fiscal year '16, so around the September timeframe. 
I think on the international side, which has become a bigger part of our business and is a very large pipeline, we're looking at what's occurring in Eastern Europe and the Ukraine, where we've been very, very strong in fiscal '16. We need that to continue. We need to see the opportunities that we've seen very well in Iraq in fiscal '16. We expect that to continue at the same level as we've seen in '16. And again, opportunities in Iraq to us, as we speak today, seem to be well supported. One of the opportunities in international that had slipped out of fiscal '16 into '17 is in Iraq but is well funded. We think that, that's going to happen in '17. There's another country in the Middle East we can't name where an opportunity did slip out, and we expect that'll happen in early '17 as well. 
And then finally, in Central Asia, meaning specifically Afghanistan, we've had a very strong year this year. Opportunities there seem well supported. And we do expect Afghanistan and more broadly Central Asia to be a strong contributor to revenue into next year. Now outside of Tactical Communications, we have a broader business -- outside of legacy tactical we have a broader communications business, including Exelis, the radio business from Exelis, which is mostly international. We've been tracking an opportunity in Saudi Arabia for quite some time. It's about $40 million, $50 million in size for SINCGARS radios for vehicles. It's been hung up in the Saudi Royal Court for a number of months, and we need that to break free as we get into '17 as well. So maybe, Pete, just a little bit of shape and color around what we expect going into next year."

And we've done, I think, a very good job. We get at it very, very quickly. And we still feel good about hitting our run rate savings as we exit '17 in that $140 million, $150 million net range, which is more aggressive than we thought. We're closing about 15% of our floor space, and that's tracking very, very well. So that has been our #1 focus. And that's how we justified the acquisition. It was really on cost take-out. 
On the revenue side, yes, there -- we've got our teams really focused on this. Dana Mehnert, who's been here at Harris for more than 30 years and really built our Tactical Radio business into what it is today, has now taken on a role as Head of Global Business Development, really with an eye towards how do we grow in major markets around the world where the opportunities might be a little bit outside of the horizon or between businesses or might involve bringing together, strapping together some technology from Exelis with Harris. And his focus is really on that. And it's across the gamut. It's across technology, across platforms, across geographies or channels to market. In all those things we're starting to see some opportunities. 
And as we get beyond this year and start to shape '17 we'll talk a bit more about where they start to -- where we're starting to see those opportunities come to fruition. What I'd rather do is talk about the ones that we are actually achieving as we achieve them as opposed to speculating about where they might be. 
One last point on this, Howard, because I think this is very important, and I want to make sure investors don't miss this. It's not just about applying common technologies, going after channels. But part of what we're doing in driving operational excellence and integration into -- across Exelis is improving program performance. This is very important. The best way to grow a business is performing well on what you're doing today. And in the note that -- in Rahul's prepared remarks, he talked about the SENSOR program. The SENSOR program was being recompeted because the performance wasn't quite up to snuff with the Air Force. And through a lot of work, the on-time delivery of the program has improved dramatically. And now we're starting to get awards back on SENSOR. And the competition has been canceled, going to one of the pieces of SENSOR, because of the improved performance. So I feel if we just keep focused on performance and executing very, very well, that'll help us grow our business into the future as well."

'17 is a little bit too soon to call. I do see it coming off the bottom in '16 into '17. But I think '18 is really the growth year. And I think it really relates to the flow-in from some of these modernization programs where we're very, very, well-positioned, including in SOCOM. So the DoD I think clearly is a growth driver. 
On the international side, we've seen fantastic growth over the last few years. We've seen a little bit of softness this year. The pipeline is still very robust. We are still well positioned. Competitively we're very strong. Where we are going out to compete we win, almost all the places that we are competing in around the world where we have a position. I think the opportunity in Australia, where we've become the preferred supplier for a very large contract which includes systems and products, is an important part of our strategy because we need to increase the size of the addressable market we're going after in international in order to continue to see growth in that international base over time.

The energy business is still under a lot of pressure. And oil prices have recovered a little bit, but still well down. A lot of the energy majors are reporting some pretty terrible numbers right now. For the year we still expect CapRock energy to be down about 25%. We were down in the 20% range-ish in the first half, and it will be worse than that, obviously, in the second half. As we get into Q4, we see the revenue in Q4 in CapRock energy to be on the order of about $60 million in the quarter. So if you just annualize that, you're sort of around $240 million for the year as we exit fiscal '16. 
And for perspective, in fiscal '16 overall, revenue in CapRock energy was around $290 million. So the math would imply that we'll see a little bit of another downturn on an annual basis in '17 over '16. '16, again, is down about 25% from fiscal '15. So we are seeing another step down as we get into next year. But it's not different than what we described last time and did -- and built into our guidance for this year. I guess, as you saw the CN margins, we're down a little bit sequentially. We did lose money in energy in Q3, but we've done quite a bit of restructuring, as we laid out to investors back in February, and we do expect the energy business to go back to profitability in Q4 and be less of a profit driver as we get into fiscal '17."

In fact, that's exactly what we've been able to do in Australia. Some very important large global players are on the Harris team in Australia providing components to us.

Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning everybody. Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, and I'm pleased with our performance. Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 on organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 60.2%",1143,"Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning everybody. Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, and I'm pleased with our performance. 
Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 on organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 60.2% and free cash flow was strong at $772 million. Book-to-bill was greater than 1. And we executed well against the key priorities we set out at the beginning of the year. First was a successfully integrated Exelis, a company which added scale, a broader portfolio of technologies, new market opportunities and improved operating resilience, and we're moving faster and achieving greater savings than initially expected. We exited fiscal '16, year 1 of integration at a net savings run rate of $120 million, the top end of what we originally committed to by year 3. And we're tracking well towards achieving $140 million to $150 million net as we exit fiscal '17. The second priority was to continue to reshape our portfolio. And in April, we saw the aerostructures business we acquired with Exelis at an attractive multiple using the proceeds to pay down debt. The third priority was to maximize free cash flow when we exceeded our guidance of $750 million to tight management of capital spending and a 4-day improvement in working capital, absorbing over $100 million in cash, restructuring and integration costs and $174 million in cash pension contributions. 
And finally, our fourth priority was the deleverage. And during the year, we retired $650 million in debt. About 1/3 of our 3-year debt reduction goal, allowing us to rebalance our capital deployment priorities as we reinitiate share repurchases in fiscal '17, with a placeholder of $150 million. And we executed these priorities while also continuing to drive operational excellence deep into the company to lower cost and improved program execution, reinvesting some of the savings in R&D to drive future growth. Company-funded R&D was again, this year, a little more than 4% of revenue, a spending rate higher than our peers, and what led to a number of important strategic wins. So let me provide a few highlights in the quarter before I discuss our detailed segment financial performance.
Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.45, up 10%, with the results benefiting from the acquisition of lower tax rate and improved operating performance. Operating profit was up 6% and margin improved by 190 basis points, on organic revenue down 6%. Improved performance was driven by the capture synergy savings, lower cost and solid execution within space and intelligence, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks, all contributing to higher income and higher margin.
Space and Intel had another terrific quarter with revenue up 10% and operating margin up of 510 basis points, following an equally important impressive Q3, with continued strength in the classified area, including Space Superiority and protection. We're successfully leveraging our broader technology portfolio. And in the quarter, we were awarded a $104 million contract as prime in a new classified mission area that could potentially develop into another key franchise for Harris. 
In the commercial space market, we're seeing the beginning of a recapitalization and fleet expansion cycle. Following an award in Q3, for a new 18-meters space reflector, we received in the fourth quarter, a contract from Airbus for a 12-meter folded rib reflector for the European space agency's biomass satellite. Our opportunity pipeline in this area remains robust heading into fiscal '17. 
Electronic Systems also delivered excellent results with revenue up 4%, driven by higher electronic warfare and counter IED sales and 910 basis points of margin expansion. Electronic warfare was up in both Q3 and Q4, coming off a weak first half, and we continue to win modernizations on legacy platforms with orders for the year doubling over prior year. And significantly following the close of the quarter, ES received a 2-year $189 million contract from a country in the Middle East to provide the land forces with an integrated data management system, showcasing our competitive strength as a prime contractor, providing an integrated solution. The contract is for 1 brigade. But there are opportunities to add 3 more land brigades, sustainment, radios and operations center to incorporate air, navy and ground force communications. This contract also positions us well for similar projects in other countries in the region. And while Critical Networks were down 6%, it was better-than-expected. And strong cost controls and program execution along with savings from prior quarter restructuring actions at CapRock drove 310 basis points of margin expansion in this segment. On the other end of the spectrum, Communication Systems was weaker-than-expected with revenue down 24% and margins 250 basis points lower than prior year. Tactical Communications declined 29% with legacy Harry's down 40% with book-to-bill of 0.92. 
In the international market, funding remains relatively solid but our $1.77 billion follow-on contract that supports foreign military sales took longer to finalize than expected. And coupled with an overburdened administrative approval process for task orders cost several opportunities to stretch out beyond the end of the year. In July, we booked all the revenue that slipped from 4Q. The U.S. tactical market was also during the quarter as the starting to see more cautious customer buying behavior in advance of a likely CR this fall. So while I'm disappointed by the fall off in communications system, I'm really proud of how the team responded to meet the earnings and cash flow guidance presented in our Q3 call, pointing to the operating resilience of the new post-acquisition Harris. 
Today, we're initiating guidance for fiscal '17, reflecting continued progress and solid execution of our strategy. We expect earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90, flat to up 4% on organic revenue, down 1% to 4%, with operating margin continuing to increase due to synergies, lower costs and pension tailwind. And with another year of strong free cash flow. We've set fiscal '17 guidance expectations for tactical in line with a slower environment we're currently experiencing, and we believe we're being appropriately conservative in our estimates. 
So before turning the call over to Rahul to provide some detailed segment results and guidance, I'd like to comment on the joint press release with Jenna Partners issued earlier today. As a result of constructive engagement with Jana, we reached an agreement to appoint 2 mutually agreed independent directors to our board. One will be announced in early September, and both will be nominated in our proxy for the October Annual Meeting. We have an ongoing dialogue with all of our shareholders, and we welcome their input. We have a long history of strong corporate governance, and we're firmly committed to maximizing long-term value for all of our shareholders. We look forward to the contributions that these 2 new directors will bring to the board. So with that, let me turn it over to Rahul."

Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. So turning now to segment detail on Slide 5 and comparisons to prior year pro forma results. Organic revenue comparisons, exclude aerostructures",1117,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. 
So turning now to segment detail on Slide 5 and comparisons to prior year pro forma results. Organic revenue comparisons, exclude aerostructures and just like prior quarters, Exelis and Harris, were combined for all of fiscal '15. Communication Systems segment revenue was $436 million, and down 24% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications were down 29% and public safety, down 10%. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower tactical revenue in Northern Africa due to the expected completion of a large modernization and by a lower revenue in the Middle East. And even though the Middle East market remains relatively soft, revenue from the region was up sequentially. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $120 million and operating margin was still strong at 27.5%, even on much lower revenue. We ended the year with legacy tactical backlog of $402 million, and slightly lower than the third quarter backlog of $419 million as a result of orders that pushed out from the $1.77 billion IDIQ from the fourth quarter just built just referenced. 
On Slide 11, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical orders, revenue and backlog.
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $529 million, up 10% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including in the area of space priority and protection. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $83 million and operating margin was strong at 15.7% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.6%. In addition to the classified orders that Bill has already addressed, Harris was awarded a 3-year $38 million contract for a large baseline imager modules for weather monitoring above goes our satellites. This win is an excellent example of the complimentary nature of combining Exelis' sensibility for satellite ground processing capability. 
Turning to electronic systems on Slide 7. Revenue was $381 million and up 4% on an organic basis compared to prior year, with higher revenue in electronic warfare and counter IED systems. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $73 million and operating margin was solid at 19.2% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.1%. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 8. Revenue was $575 million and down 6% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization program was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services and from the wind down of 2 major programs mentioned in previous earnings calls, and lower revenue in CapRock's energy business. 
Operating income in the fourth quarter was $81 million and operating margin was 14.1%. Margin improvement was in large part driven by previous CapRock cost reduction actions that resulted in a CapRock's energy business returning to profitability in the fourth quarter despite a significantly lower revenue than the third quarter.
So moving to Slide 9 and 10. Today, we are initiating fiscal GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $5.53 to $5.73 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $5.70 to $5.90. Non-GAAP EPS excludes about $30 million to $35 million of integration costs. To remind you, non-GAAP guidance still includes approximately $132 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition intangible amortization. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% an organic basis, excluding aerostructures. EPS guidance reflects a change in FAS accounting methodology. Today, we have used -- historically, we have used a single discount rate for calculating the interest and service cost associated with pension obligations. Beginning in fiscal '17, we will measure the FAS fashion cost in a given year using a spot rates approach. We adopted this approach as we believe it provides a more precise measurement of our pension service and interest cost since it matches each year's individual spot rates to the projected cash flows in that year. We also reduced our expected pensions asset rate of return assumption by 25 basis points to 7.75% for 2017. EPS guidance also includes $150 million in share repurchases plans during the year. Other EPS guidance details are outlined on Slide 9, including an expected tax rate of 31%, in line with fiscal '16 results. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $800 million in fiscal '17. We ended fiscal '16 with 49 days of working capital, a reduction of 4 days from the beginning of the year. Our fiscal '17 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance and GAAP spend of approximately $175 million.
Turning now to segment guidance. In communications system, revenue is expected to be down 7% to 9%, with significant decline in Tactical Communications and Public Safety trending higher. Within Tactical Communications, Harris legacy DoD is expected to be flat to up and legacy international, down in mid-teens. In legacy DoD, we expect fourth quarter's cautious buying behavior to continue. However, we also expect and initial Army modernization to contribute to revenue in the tens of millions each. And legacy international, since the third quarter earnings calls, our views have not changed significantly on where we expect areas of opportunity and challenges in fiscal '17. Overall, we expect revenue to be once again underpinned by FMS funding support for opportunities in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa and Central Asia. Segment operating margin is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, reflecting the impact of lower revenue offset by synergies from the Exelis acquisition. In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3%, with continuing strength in classified and uptick in commercial space. Segment operating margin is expected to be in the range of 16% to 17%. In electronic systems, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% on an organic basis. Revenue will be higher in electronic warfare, driven by the growth in backlog in 2016 and given the recent significant $189 million win that Bill just referenced. Segment operating margin is expected to improve to a range of 20% to 21%. 
In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 3% to 6%, with mission network's revenue trending higher due to a solid FAA franchise and international air traffic management opportunities. This has been more than offset by continued weakness in CapRock Energy and still tough comparisons for IT services. For IT Services, we expect revenue to stabilize at approximately $225 million to $250 million a quarter. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 12% to 13%. 
So now let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, excellent progress in a multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis and realize the full synergies and accretion. We'll continue to drive our operational excellence program to not only lower cost but also to streamline processes, improve program execution and increase customer satisfaction. And we'll continue to reinvest in R&D to grow our core franchises and address near adjacencies where technology and innovation are differentiators. An important part of our strategy to drive shareholder value is optimizing our business portfolio by focusing on investments in which technology provides differentiation. We dispassionately, objectively and assess business are strategically fit in our better value to Harris as well as which businesses may be a better value on their own or with a third-party. When we believe a business is not core to our strategy to drive shareholder value, we undertake proactive steps as evidenced by the recent sale of Aerostructures and the sale of our commercial health care and broadcast communications businesses in prior years. We'll continue to assess our portfolio with a goal of enhancing shareholder value creation. And as Rahul just described, fiscal '17 guidance. While we still expect revenue headwinds to persist, we also expect additional acquisition savings in our continuing focus on lowering costs to result in higher fiscal '17 earnings. Our guidance anticipates a continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year and the spending constraints it typically creates until the budget is passed, especially in our shorter-cycle tactical business. Longer-term, we expect positive momentum to Space & Intel and Electronic Systems to continue. And we also anticipate a recovery in the tactical market driven by Army and SOCOM modernizations as well as other international modernization such as Australia and in the Middle East and North Africa. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So it was down quite a bit year-over-year in the fourth quarter, probably around 35%. For the year in '16, down about 25%. With sitting down in the low 40s, now was a bit of incremental pressure. Although there is some service companies that are out there expecting some recovery and to '17 and maybe the back end of '17. We do see another step down next year. We were sizing it at about 25%. We took some pretty aggressive restructuring actions, really, over the last 12 to 18 months. But you recall pretty significantly as we exit to Q2. And those have started to take hold. We must Manny and CapRock Energy in Q3. We returned to profitability in Q4. And that's part of the reason why you see to see a network, Critical Network segment, being more profitable in Q4. Profit comes from some turn around on the CapRock business. So I think we sized it for next year. We expect a big money in CapRock Energy next year. But we do see another step down in that segment again, about 25%. On the services side, we were down 10%, 11% in the services in the year, down about 22% in the services side mission sustainment, which was about what we had expected, maybe a little bit better in Q4 but about what we expected. We do see another step down next year, sort of in the high single-digit range. We have a pretty good pipeline of opportunities. We ended fiscal '16  in that business with a book-to-bill of 1. So are helping backlog in the next of the year. We're previously said about 1/3 of that business was up for we can feed and it's going to put pressure into '17. When I'll get into that pressure into '17. But some of the recompetes are now behind us. And if for very pretty well, we may be at ahead of us. And what we're seeing here is that the recompetes are we're winning them, we do when them. The common single vendor IDIQs instead of regular contracts. So we still have to compete for task orders. So we do revenue pressure in '17 in services. But not quite at the downturn we saw in '16, Howard."

We continued to tightly manage our capital spending. So next year, we guided to about $800 million in free cash flow with a little bit of a step up in capital spending although we remain very, very tight on that at $175 million. We still see a pack to get into $1 billion by fiscal '19, that was a 3-year goal that we set out. And it comes from the same things we described before on this call. So with integration savings rolling this year sort of hit really growing going into '18. We see lower cash integration cost. Was a lower cash interest expense as we see some additional working capital performance improvements. And since we have closed about 50% of our floor space and about 2 million square feet, we do see some additional capital spending efficiencies as we get further out in time. So those are the still -- they still remain set to be the key drivers of hitting $1 billion in '19."

But then on top of that, we see tens of millions  of opportunities into areas as Rahul mentioned, modernization opportunities which could include the MNVR opportunities as well as on and that should bring us to flat top slightly. We do see another step down next year in the international business. We see that our pipeline still remains pretty healthy in that business. But we do see that business down sort of mid-teens going into next year. Not a lot really has changed in many ways since our Q3 release in terms of the overall sets of risks and opportunities we see out there. We'll still see some good funding on the horizon. But we see that business down a little bit going into next year. And maybe, Noah, just to give you a little bit more color on this. As we look into '17, we see about 1/3 of that business is in Europe which as you know, with the topic for in '16, was coming up a pretty good record Eastern Europe and Ukraine remain very, very solid. We still see that strong going into '17 but will be down slightly from what was a record year. We see about 1/3 of the businesses in the Middle East and Africa. Where we do expect to see a relatively slow pace to continue, revenue to be flat to down slightly. Iraq remains one of our biggest opportunities in the Middle East. There's another country in the Middle East which will is a little bit of a recovery offset that. But again, that Middle East, Africa should be probably down slightly to a flat next year. The balance of the business are about 10% to 50% each in AsiaPac and Australia. Australia should be that up a little bit because Israeli is going to come in a little bit stronger next year. We see Central America, Latin America to be flat to up slightly a little bit. We do see Brazil a little bit weaker. We see Mexico a little bit stronger. But that region up a little bit. But really, as we look out into the next year, the big challenge we're facing is really in Central Asia.

And on the CS segment, was he that segment down next year. But when you look at 2 things. Web-mac, to visible words and actions happening on Army modernization, SOCOM organization. Those activities are moving quickly. Our Rifleman Radio is now through both customer test and call test. The Manpack radio is now through qualification test. They expect to go into delivery orders into early part of our Harris fiscal '18. SOCOM is  moving nicely. We do see substantial budget upticks in '17 from '16 as well as in '18 from '17.

So our total deficit ended at $2.3 billion, up $100 million from 20 -- where we ended last year. It really is no impact on contributions to go that kind of a different formula.

Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, and I'm pleased with our performance.Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 on organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 16.2%,",1144,"Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, and I'm pleased with our performance.
Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 on organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 16.2%, and free cash flow was strong at $772 million. Book-to-bill was greater than 1.
And we executed well against the key priorities we set out at the beginning of the year. First was to successfully integrate Exelis, a company which added scale, a broader portfolio of technologies, new market opportunities and improved operating resilience, and we're moving faster in achieving greater savings than initially expected. We exited fiscal '16, year 1 of integration, at a net savings run rate of $120 million, the top end of what we originally committed to by year 3. And we're tracking well towards achieving $140 million to $150 million net as we exit fiscal '17.
The second priority was to continue to reshape our portfolio. And in April, we saw the Aerostructures business we acquired with Exelis at an attractive multiple, using the proceeds to pay down debt.
The third priority was to maximize free cash flow when we exceeded our guidance of $750 million to tight management of capital spending and a 4-day improvement in working capital, absorbing over $100 million in cash, restructuring and integration costs and $174 million in cash pension contributions.
And finally, our fourth priority was the deleverage. And during the year, we retired $650 million in debt, about 1/3 of our 3-year debt reduction goal, allowing us to rebalance our capital deployment priorities as we reinitiate share repurchases in fiscal '17 with a placeholder of $150 million.
And we executed these priorities while also continuing to drive operational excellence deep into the company to lower cost and improved program execution, reinvesting some of the savings in R&D to drive future growth. Company-funded R&D was again, this year, a little more than 4% of revenue, a spending rate higher than our peers, and which has led to a number of important strategic wins.
So let me provide a few highlights in the quarter before Rahul discuss our detailed segment financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.45, up 10%, with results benefiting from the acquisition of lower tax rate and improved operating performance. Operating profit was up 6% and margin improved by 190 basis points on organic revenue down 6%. Improved performance was driven by the capture synergy savings, lower cost and solid execution within Space and Intelligence, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks, all contributing to higher income and higher margin.
Space and Intel had another terrific quarter with revenue up 10% and operating margin up 510 basis points, following an equally important impressive Q3 with continued strength in the classified area, including space superiority and protection. We're successfully leveraging our broader technology portfolio. And in the quarter, we were awarded a $104 million contract as prime in a new classified mission area that could potentially develop into another key franchise for Harris.
In the commercial space market, we're seeing the beginning of a recapitalization and fleet expansion cycle. Following an award in Q3 for a new 18-meters space reflector, we received, in the fourth quarter, a contract from Airbus for a 12-meter folded rib reflector for the European Space Agency's Biomass satellite. Our opportunity pipeline in this area remains robust heading into fiscal '17.
The Electronic Systems also delivered excellent results with revenue up 4%, driven by higher electronic warfare and counter IED sales, a 910 basis points of margin expansion. Electronic warfare was up in both Q3 and Q4, coming off a weak first half, and we continued to win modernizations on legacy platforms with orders for the year doubling over prior year. And significantly following the close of the quarter, ES received a 2-year $189 million contract from a country in the Middle East to provide the land forces with an integrated battle management system, showcasing our competitive strength as a prime contractor providing an integrated solution. The contract is for 1 brigade. But there are opportunities to add 3 more land brigades: sustainment, radios and an operations center to incorporate air, navy and ground force communications. This contract also positions us well for similar projects in other countries in the region.
And while Critical Networks was down 6%, it was better-than-expected. And strong cost controls and program execution along with savings from prior quarter restructuring actions at CapRock drove 310 basis points of margin expansion in this segment. On the other end of the spectrum, Communication Systems was weaker-than-expected with revenue down 24% and margins 250 basis points lower than prior year. Tactical Communications declined 29% with legacy Harris down 40% with book-to-bill of 0.92.
In the international market, funding remains relatively solid, but our $1.77 billion follow-on contract that supports foreign military sales took longer to finalize than expected and coupled with an overburdened administrative approval process for task orders caused several opportunities to stretch out beyond the end of the year. In July, we booked all the revenue that slipped from 4Q. The U.S. tactical market was also soft in the quarter as we're starting to see more cautious customer buying behavior in advance of a likely CR this fall. So while I'm disappointed by the fall-off in Communication Systems, I'm really proud of how the team responded to meet the earnings and cash flow guidance presented in our Q3 call, pointing to the operating resilience of the new post-acquisition Harris.
Today, we're initiating guidance for fiscal '17, reflecting continued progress and solid execution of our strategy. We expect earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90, flat to up 4% on organic revenue, down 1% to 4%, with operating margin continuing to increase due to synergies, lower costs and pension tailwind and with another year of strong free cash flow. We've set fiscal '17 guidance expectations for tactical in line with the slower environment we're currently experiencing, and we believe we're being appropriately conservative in our estimates.
So before turning the call over to Rahul to provide some detailed segment results and guidance, I'd like to comment on the joint press release with JANA Partners issued earlier today. As a result of constructive engagement with JANA, we reached an agreement to appoint 2 mutually agreed independent directors to our board. One will be announced in early September, and both will be nominated in our proxy for the October Annual Meeting. We have an ongoing dialogue with all of our shareholders, and we welcome their input. We have a long history of strong corporate governance, and we're firmly committed to maximizing long-term value for all of our shareholders. We look forward to the contributions that these 2 new directors will bring to the board.
So with that, let me turn it over to Rahul."

So turning now to segment detail on Slide 5 and comparisons to prior year pro forma results. Organic revenue comparisons exclude Aerostructures and just like prior quarters, or as if, Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. Communication Systems segment revenue was $436 million and down 24% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 29% and public safety down 10%. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower tactical revenue in Northern Africa due to the expected completion of a large modernization tranche and by lower revenue in the Middle East. And even though the Middle East market remains relatively soft, revenue from the region was up sequentially. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $120 million and operating margin was still strong at 27.5%, even on much lower revenue. We ended the year with legacy tactical backlog of $402 million and slightly lower than the third quarter backlog of $419 million as a result of orders that pushed out from the $1.77 billion IDIQ from fourth quarter that Bill just referenced.
On Slide 11, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical orders, revenue and backlog.
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $529 million, up 10% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including in the area of space superiority and protection. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $83 million and operating margin was strong at 15.7% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.6%. In addition to the classified orders that Bill has already addressed, Harris was awarded a 3-year $38 million contract for advanced baseline imager spare modules for weather monitoring aboard NOAA's GOES-R satellites. This win is an excellent example of the complimentary nature of combining Exelis' sense of capability for satellites with Harris' ground processing capability.
Turning to electronic systems on Slide 7. Revenue was $381 million and up 4% on an organic basis compared to prior year with higher revenue in electronic warfare and counter IED systems. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $73 million and operating margin was solid at 19.2% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.1%.
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 8. Revenue was $575 million and down 6% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset by lower revenue in IT services and from the wind-down of 2 major programs mentioned in previous earnings calls and lower revenue in CapRock's energy business. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $81 million and operating margin was 14.1%. Margin improvement was in large part driven by previous CapRock cost reduction actions that resulted in CapRock's energy business returning to profitability in the fourth quarter despite significantly lower revenue than the third quarter.
So moving to Slide 9 and 10. Today, we are initiating fiscal GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $5.53 to $5.73 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $5.70 to $5.90. Non-GAAP EPS excludes about $30 million to $35 million of integration costs. To remind you, non-GAAP guidance still includes approximately $132 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition intangible amortization. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding Aerostructures. EPS guidance reflects a change in FAS accounting methodology. Today, we have used -- historically, we have used a single discount rate for calculating the interest and service cost associated with pension obligations. Beginning in fiscal '17, we will measure the FAS pension cost in a given year using a spot rate approach. We adopted this approach as we believe it provides a more precise measurement of our pension service and interest cost since it matches each year's individual spot rate to the projected cash flows in that year. We also reduced our expected pension asset rate of return assumption by 25 basis points to 7.75% for 2017. EPS guidance also includes $150 million in share repurchases plans during the year. Other EPS guidance details are outlined on Slide 9, including an expected tax rate of 31%, in line with fiscal '16 results. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $800 million in fiscal '17. We ended fiscal '16 with 49 days of working capital, a reduction of 4 days from the beginning of the year. Our fiscal '17 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance and CapEx spend of approximately $175 million.
Turning now to segment guidance. In Communication Systems, revenue is expected to be down 7% to 9% with significant decline in Tactical Communications and Public Safety trending higher.
Within Tactical Communications, Harris legacy DoD is expected to be flat to up and legacy international down in mid-teens. In legacy DoD, we expect fourth quarter's cautious buying behavior to continue. However, we also expect MUOS and initial Army modernization to contribute revenue in low tens of millions each. In legacy international, since the third quarter earnings call, our views have not changed significantly on where we expect areas of opportunity and challenges in fiscal '17. Overall, we expect revenue to be once again underpinned by FMS funding support for opportunities in Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Central Asia. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 29.5% to 30.5%, reflecting the impact of lower revenue offset by synergies from Exelis acquisition.
In Space and Intelligence System, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% with continuing strength in classified and uptick in commercial space. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 16% to 17%.
In Electronic Systems, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% on an organic basis. Revenue will be higher in electronic warfare, driven by the growth in backlog in 2016 and in C4i given the recent significant $189 million win that Bill just referenced. Segment operating margin is expected to improve to a range of 20% to 21%.
In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 3% to 6% with mission network's revenue trending higher due to a solid FAA franchise and international air traffic management opportunities. This is being more than offset by continued weakness in CapRock Energy and still tough compares in IT services. For IT Services, we expect revenue to stabilize at approximately $225 million to $250 million a quarter. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 12% to 13%.
So now let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, excellent progress in a multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis and realize the full synergies and accretion. We'll continue to drive our operational excellence program to not only lower cost but also to streamline processes, improve program execution and increase customer satisfaction. And we'll continue to reinvest in R&D to grow our core franchises and address near adjacencies where technology and innovation are differentiators. An important part of our strategy to drive shareholder value is optimizing our business portfolio by focusing on investments in which technology provides differentiation. We dispassionately, objectively and aggressively assess which businesses strategically fit in our better value to Harris as well as which businesses may be a better value on their own or with a third-party. When we believe a business is not core to our strategy to drive shareholder value, we undertake proactive steps, as evidenced by the recent sale of Aerostructures and the sale of our commercial health care and broadcast communications businesses in prior years. We'll continue to assess our portfolio with the goal of enhancing shareholder value creation.
And as Rahul just described, fiscal '17 guidance. While we still expect revenue headwinds to persist, we also expect additional acquisition savings and our continuing focus on lowering costs to result in higher fiscal '17 earnings. Our guidance anticipates a continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year and the spending constraints it typically creates until the budget is passed, especially on our shorter-cycle tactical business. Longer-term, we expect positive momentum in Space and Intel and Electronic Systems to continue. And we also anticipate a recovery in the tactical market, driven by Army and SOCOM modernizations as well as other international modernizations such as in Australia and in the Middle East and North Africa.
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So it was down quite a bit year-over-year in the fourth quarter, probably around 35%; for the year in '16, down about 25%. With oil sitting down in the low 40s now, we see a bit of incremental pressure. Although there's some service companies out there that are expecting some recovery into '17 and maybe the back end of '17, we do see another step-down next year. We were sizing it at about 25%. We took some pretty aggressive restructuring actions really over the last 12 to 18 months, but you recall pretty significantly as we exited Q2. And those started to take hold. We lost money in CapRock Energy in Q3. We returned to profitability in Q4. And that's part of the reason why you see the CN segment, Critical Network segment, being a little more profitable in Q4. Part of it comes from some turnaround in the CapRock business. So I think we've sized it for next year. We expect big money in CapRock Energy next year, but we do see another step-down in that segment again, about 25%. On the services side, we were down 10%, 11% in the services in the year, down about 22% in the services side mission sustainment, which was about what we had expected, maybe a little bit better in Q4, but about what we expected. We do see another step down next year, sort of in a high single-digit range. We have a pretty good pipeline of opportunities. We ended fiscal '16 in that business with a book-to-bill of 1. So we're holding backlog going into next year. We had previously said about the 1/3 of that business was up for a recompete, and it was going to put some pressure into '17. We're now guiding to that pressure into '17. But some of the recompetes are now behind us. I think we're fairing pretty well. There's a few that are still ahead of us. What we're seeing here is that the recompetes, we're winning them. When we do when them, they are coming as -- instead of single vendor, they are more multi-vendor or IDIQs instead of regular contracts. So we still have to compete for task orders. So we do still see some revenue pressure in '17 in services, but not quite at the downturn we saw in '16, Howard."

We continue to tightly manage our capital spending. So next year, we guided to about $800 million in free cash flow with a little bit of a step-up in capital spending, although we remain very, very tight on that at $175 million. We still see a pact to get into $1 billion by fiscal '19, that was a 3-year goal that we set out. And it comes from the same things we described before on this call. Certainly, the integration savings rolling this year and sort of hit steady state really growing going into '18. We see lower cash integration cost. We see lower cash interest expense as we see some additional working capital performance improvements. And since we have closed about 50% of our floor space or about 2 million square feet, we do see some additional capital spending efficiencies as we get further out in time. So those are the still -- they still remain set to be the key drivers of hitting $1 billion in '19."

But then on top of that, we see tens of millions of opportunities in 2 areas, as Rahul mentioned, army modernization opportunities, which would include the MNVR opportunity as well as on MUOS, and that should bring us to flat to up slightly. We do see another step-down next year in the international business. We see that our pipeline still remains pretty healthy in that business. But we do see that business down sort of mid-teens going into next year. Not a lot really has changed in many ways since our Q3 release in terms of the overall sets of risks and opportunities that are still out there. We'll still see some good funding on the horizon. But we see that business down a little bit going into next year. And maybe, Noah, just to give you a little bit more color on this, as we look out into '17, we see about 1/3 of that business is in Europe, which, as you know, we've talked before, and '16 was coming off a pretty good record. Eastern Europe and the Ukraine remain very, very solid. We still see that strong going into '17, but it will be down slightly from what was a record year. We see about 1/3 of the businesses in the Middle East and Africa, where we do expect to see a relatively slow pace to continue, revenue to be flat to down slightly. Iraq remains one of our biggest opportunities in the Middle East. There's another country in the Middle East, which you'll see a little bit of a recovering offset that. But again, that Middle East, Africa should be probably down slightly to flat next year. The balance of the business are about 10% to 50% each in AsiaPac and Australia. Australia should be -- that region should be flat to up a little bit because Australia is going to come in a little bit stronger next year. We see Central America, Latin America to be flat to up slightly a little bit. We do see Brazil a little bit weaker. We see Mexico a little bit stronger. But that region up a little bit. But really, as we look out into the next year, the big challenge we're facing is really in Central Asia and particular in Afghanistan as a pretty big program runs from lots of new radios in the past to more sustainment in '17 and beyond, and actually, the biggest piece of the headwind going into next year."

And so the point being, there's just sort of a lot of uncertainty around the growth trajectory beyond '17, recognizing that's not the most fair question given where you are. I don't know if there's any way you could speak to those inputs, even directionally given, to given some people some comfort in that part of the model."

That's Electronic Systems and Space and Intel. So those are performing very, very well, and we expect that they continue. Within Critical Networks, we see our mission networks FAA business to be -- it was -- has been strong this past year, very strong in the second half of '16, continuing up next year, good international opportunities. So we see that continuing to grow going into next year. We think services' going to stabilize as we go beyond '17 and '18. So it won't be as much of a drag. And then on the CS segment, we see that segment down next year. But when you look at 2 things, one, the pace of words and actions happening on army modernization and SOCOM modernization, those activities are moving quickly. Our Rifleman Radio is now through both customer test and qual test. The Manpack radio is now through qualification test. They expect to go into delivery orders into early part of our Harris fiscal '18. SOCOM moves -- is moving nicely. We do see substantial budget upticks in '17 from '16 as well then in '18 from '17, so very good strong funding support for that. On the international side, the pipeline remains very, very strong. The needs are out there. The funding is not moving at pace as we had expected, but there's a strong need that's out there. The pipeline is pretty robust. And going out beyond '17, we see markets like Australia to be quite significant and be a contributor as we into '18. So we still believe that '18 will be a growth year for Harris Corporation, and I think we're positioning ourselves well to grow in that time period."

So I won't really size or shape the tactical business for fiscal '17. On the pipelines, the DoD pipeline still remains pretty healthy. It's a $900 million to $1 billion size. We do start to see more of the modernization opportunity starting to come into the pipeline. On the international side, the pipeline remains about $2.6 billion, we said last time about $2.9 billion. The big opportunity we had in there that drove it to $2.9 billion was Australia, $600 million. We feel good about the opportunity. It's still out there. As we've gotten in detailed negotiations with Australia, they may split that into 2 pieces. They may do $300 million, $350 million at the back-end of our fiscal '17. The balance may slip out a little bit beyond that. And that was the key driver of brining down our international pipeline to about $2.6 billion.

So we had previously said that our pension liabilities increase about roughly $180-ish million for every 25 basis points reduction in discount rate. And the discount rate changed by 40 basis points, but that was partially offset by the contributions we had made and certain changes in the postretirement benefits. So our total deficit ended at $2.3 billion, up $100 million from 20 -- where we ended last year. It really has no impact on our contributions because that's kind of a different formula. Our total contributions will go up a little bit next year because discount rate at which we calculate with contributions is coming down, and also the rate of return on assets need to be factored in. So contributions are up about $10 million, $15 million year-over-year. But that also gets offset by the CAS reimbursements that we get from the government."

Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 on organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 16.2%, and free cash flow was strong at $772 million. Book-to-bill was greater than 1.
And we executed well against the key priorities we set out at the beginning of the year. First was to successfully integrate Exelis, a company which added scale, a broader portfolio of technologies, new market opportunities and improved operating resilience, and we're moving faster and achieving greater savings than initially expected. We exited fiscal '16, year 1 of integration, at a net savings run rate of $120 million, the top end of what we originally committed to by year 3. And we're tracking well towards achieving $140 million to $150 million net as we exit fiscal '17.
The second priority was to continue to reshape our portfolio. And in April, we saw the Aerostructures business we acquired with Exelis at an attractive multiple, using the proceeds to pay down debt.
The third priority was to maximize free cash flow when we exceeded our guidance of $750 million through tight management of capital spending and a 4-day improvement in working capital, absorbing over $100 million in cash, restructuring and integration costs and $174 million in cash pension contributions.
And finally, our fourth priority was to deleverage. And during the year, we retired $650 million in debt, about 1/3 of our 3-year debt reduction goal, allowing us to rebalance our capital deployment priorities as we reinitiate share repurchases in fiscal '17 with a placeholder of $150 million.
And we executed these priorities while also continuing to drive operational excellence deep into the company to lower costs and improved program execution, reinvesting some of the savings in R&D to drive future growth. Company-funded R&D was again, this year, a little more than 4% of revenue, a spending rate higher than our peers, and which has led to a number of important strategic wins.
So let me provide a few highlights in the quarter before Rahul discusses our detailed segment financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.45, up 10%, with results benefiting from the acquisition, a lower tax rate and improved operating performance. Operating profit was up 6% and margin improved by 190 basis points on organic revenue down 6%. Improved performance was driven by the capture of synergy savings, lower cost and solid execution within Space and Intelligence, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks, all contributing to higher income and higher margin.
Space and Intel had another terrific quarter with revenue up 10% and operating margin up 510 basis points, following an equally-impressive Q3, with continued strength in the classified area, including space superiority and protection. We're successfully leveraging our broader technology portfolio. And in the quarter, we were awarded a $104 million contract as prime in a new classified mission area that could potentially develop into another key franchise for Harris.
In the commercial space market, we're seeing the beginning of a recapitalization and fleet expansion cycle. Following an award in Q3 for a new 18-meter space reflector, we received, in the fourth quarter, a contract from Airbus for a 12-meter folded rib reflector for the European Space Agency's Biomass satellite. Our opportunity pipeline in this area remains robust heading into fiscal '17.
The Electronic Systems also delivered excellent results with revenue up 4%, driven by higher electronic warfare and counter IED sales, and 910 basis points of margin expansion. Electronic warfare was up in both Q3 and Q4, coming off a weak first half, and we continued to win modernizations on legacy platforms with orders for the year doubling over prior year. And significantly following the close of the quarter, ES received a 2-year $189 million contract from a country in the Middle East to provide the land forces with an integrated battle management system, showcasing our competitive strength as a prime contractor providing an integrated solution. The contract is for 1 brigade. But there are opportunities to add 3 more land brigades: sustainment, radios and an operations center to incorporate air, navy and ground force communications. This contract also positions us well for similar projects in other countries in the region.
And while Critical Networks was down 6%, it was better-than-expected. And strong cost controls and program execution, along with savings from prior quarter restructuring actions at CapRock, drove 310 basis points of margin expansion in this segment. On the other end of the spectrum, Communication Systems was weaker-than-expected with revenue down 24% and margins 250 basis points lower than prior year. Tactical Communications declined 29% with legacy Harris down 40% with book-to-bill of 0.92.
In the international market, funding remains relatively solid, but our $1.77 billion follow-on contract that supports foreign military sales took longer to finalize than expected and coupled with an overburdened administrative approval process for task orders caused several opportunities to stretch out beyond the end of the year. In July, we booked all the revenue that slipped from 4Q. The U.S. tactical market was also soft in the quarter as we're starting to see more cautious customer buying behavior in advance of a likely CR this fall. So while I'm disappointed by the fall-off in Communication Systems, I'm really proud of how the team responded to meet the earnings and cash flow guidance presented in our Q3 call, pointing to the operating resilience of the new post-acquisition Harris.
Today, we're initiating guidance for fiscal '17, reflecting continued progress and solid execution of our strategy. We expect earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90, flat to up 4%. On organic revenue, down 1% to 4%, with operating margin continuing to increase due to synergies, lower costs and pension tailwind and with another year of strong free cash flow. We've set fiscal '17 guidance expectations for tactical in line with the slower environment we're currently experiencing, and we believe we're being appropriately conservative in our estimates.
So before turning the call over to Rahul to provide some detailed segment results and guidance, I'd like to comment on the joint press release with JANA Partners issued earlier today. As a result of constructive engagement with JANA, we reached an agreement to appoint 2 mutually-agreed independent directors to our board. One will be announced in early September, and both will be nominated in our proxy for the October Annual Meeting. We have an ongoing dialogue with all of our shareholders, and we welcome their input. We have a long history of strong corporate governance, and we're firmly committed to maximizing long-term value for all of our shareholders. We look forward to the contributions that these 2 new directors will bring to the board.
So with that, let me turn it over to Rahul."

Organic revenue comparisons exclude Aerostructures an",1120,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis.
So turning now to segment detail on Slide 5 and comparisons to prior year pro forma results. Organic revenue comparisons exclude Aerostructures and just like prior quarters, are as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. Communication Systems segment revenue was $436 million and down 24% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 29% and public safety down 10%. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower tactical revenue in Northern Africa due to the expected completion of a large modernization tranche and by lower revenue in the Middle East. And even though the Middle East market remains relatively soft, revenue from the region was up sequentially. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $120 million and operating margin was still strong at 27.5%, even on much lower revenue. We ended the year with legacy tactical backlog of $402 million and slightly lower than the third quarter backlog of $419 million as a result of orders that pushed out from the $1.77 billion IDIQ from fourth quarter that Bill just referenced.
On Slide 11, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical orders, revenue and backlog.
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $529 million, up 10% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including in the area of space superiority and protection. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $83 million and operating margin was strong at 15.7% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.6%. In addition to the classified orders that Bill has already addressed, Harris was awarded a 3-year $38 million contract for advanced baseline imager spare modules for weather monitoring aboard NOAA's GOES-R satellites. This win is an excellent example of the complementary nature of combining Exelis' sense of capability for satellites with Harris' ground processing capability.
Turning to electronic systems on Slide 7. Revenue was $381 million and up 4% on an organic basis compared to prior year with higher revenue in electronic warfare and counter IED systems. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $73 million and operating margin was solid at 19.2% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.1%.
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 8. Revenue was $575 million and down 6% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset by lower revenue in IT services and from the wind-down of 2 major programs mentioned in previous earnings calls and lower revenue in CapRock's energy business. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $81 million and operating margin was 14.1%. Margin improvement was in large part driven by previous CapRock cost reduction actions that resulted in CapRock's energy business returning to profitability in the fourth quarter despite significantly-lower revenue than the third quarter.
So moving to Slides 9 and 10. Today, we are initiating fiscal GAAP EPS guidance in a range of $5.53 to $5.73 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $5.70 to $5.90. Non-GAAP EPS excludes about $30 million to $35 million of integration costs. To remind you, non-GAAP guidance still includes approximately $132 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition intangible amortization. Revenue is expected to be in a range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding Aerostructures. EPS guidance reflects a change in FAS accounting methodology. Today, we have used -- historically, we have used a single discount rate for calculating the interest and service cost associated with pension obligations. Beginning in fiscal '17, we will measure the FAS pension cost in a given year using a spot rate approach. We adopted this approach as we believe it provides a more precise measurement of our pension service and interest cost since it matches each year's individual spot rate to the projected cash flows in that year. We also reduced our expected pension asset rate of return assumption by 25 basis points to 7.75% for 2017. EPS guidance also includes $150 million in share repurchases plans during the year. Other EPS guidance details are outlined on Slide 9, including an expected tax rate of 31%, in line with fiscal '16 results. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $800 million in fiscal '17. We ended fiscal '16 with 49 days of working capital, a reduction of 4 days from the beginning of the year. Our fiscal '17 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance and CapEx spend of approximately $175 million.
Turning now to segment guidance. In Communication Systems, revenue is expected to be down 7% to 9% with significant decline in Tactical Communications and Public Safety trending higher.
Within Tactical Communications, Harris legacy DoD is expected to be flat to up and legacy international down in mid-teens. In legacy DoD, we expect fourth quarter's cautious buying behavior to continue. However, we also expect MUOS and initial Army modernization to contribute revenue in low tens of millions each. In legacy international, since the third quarter earnings call, our views have not changed significantly on where we expect areas of opportunity and challenges in fiscal '17. Overall, we expect revenue to be once again underpinned by FMS funding support for opportunities in Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Central Asia. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 29.5% to 30.5%, reflecting the impact of lower revenue, offset by synergies from Exelis acquisition.
In Space and Intelligence System, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% with continuing strength in classified and uptick in commercial space. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 16% to 17%.
In Electronic Systems, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% on an organic basis. Revenue will be higher in electronic warfare, driven by the growth in backlog in 2016 and in C4i given the recent significant $189 million win that Bill just referenced. Segment operating margin is expected to improve to a range of 20% to 21%.
In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 3% to 6% with mission network's revenue trending higher due to a solid FAA franchise and international air traffic management opportunities. This has been more than offset by continued weakness in CapRock Energy and still tough compares in IT services. For IT Services, we expect revenue to stabilize at approximately $225 million to $250 million a quarter. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 12% to 13%.
So now let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, excellent progress in a multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis and realize the full synergies and accretion. We'll continue to drive our operational excellence program to not only lower cost but also to streamline processes, improve program execution and increase customer satisfaction. And we'll continue to reinvest in R&D to grow our core franchises and address near adjacencies where technology and innovation are differentiators. An important part of our strategy to drive shareholder value is optimizing our business portfolio by focusing on investments in which technology provides differentiation. We dispassionately, objectively and aggressively assess which businesses strategically fit and are a better value to Harris, as well as which businesses may be a better value on their own or with a third party. When we believe a business is not core to our strategy to drive shareholder value, we undertake proactive steps, as evidenced by the recent sale of Aerostructures and the sale of our commercial health care and broadcast communications businesses in prior years. We'll continue to assess our portfolio with the goal of enhancing shareholder value creation.
And as Rahul just described, fiscal '17 guidance. While we still expect revenue headwinds to persist, we also expect additional acquisition savings and our continuing focus on lowering costs to result in higher fiscal '17 earnings. Our guidance anticipates a continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year and the spending constraints it typically creates until the budget is passed, especially on our shorter-cycle tactical business. Longer-term, we expect positive momentum in Space and Intel and Electronic Systems to continue. And we also anticipate a recovery in the tactical market, driven by Army and SOCOM modernizations as well as other international modernizations such as in Australia and in the Middle East and Northern Africa.
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So it was down quite a bit year-over-year in the fourth quarter, probably around 35%; for the year in '16, down about 25%. With oil sitting down in the low 40s now, we see a bit of incremental pressure. Although there's some service companies out there that are expecting some recovery into '17 and maybe the back end of '17, we do see another step-down next year. We were sizing at about 25%. We took some pretty aggressive restructuring actions really over the last 12 months to 18 months, but you recall pretty significantly as we exited Q2. And those are starting to take hold. We lost money in CapRock Energy in Q3. We returned to profitability in Q4. And that's part of the reason why you see the CN segment, Critical Network segment, being a little more profitable in Q4. Part of it comes from some turnaround in the CapRock business. So I think we've sized it for next year. We expect to make money in CapRock Energy next year, but we do see another step-down in that segment again, about 25%. On the services side, we were down 10%, 11% in the services in the year, down about 22% in the services side, mission sustainment, which was about what we had expected, maybe a little bit better in Q4, but about what we expected. We do see another step-down next year, sort of in a high single-digit range. We have a pretty good pipeline of opportunities. We ended fiscal '16 in that business with a book-to-bill of 1. So we're holding backlog going into next year. We had previously said about 1/3 of that business was up for recompete, and it was going to put some pressure into '17. We're now guiding to that pressure into '17. But some of the recompetes are now behind us. I think we're faring pretty well. There's a few that are still ahead of us. What we're seeing here is that the recompetes, we're winning them. Where we do win them, they are coming as -- instead of single vendor, they are more multi-vendor or IDIQs instead of regular contracts. So we still have to compete for task orders. So we do still see some revenue pressure in '17 in services, but not quite at the downturn we saw in '16, Howard."

We still see a path to getting to $1 billion by fiscal '19; that was a 3-year goal that we set out. And it comes from the same things we described before on this call. Certainly, the integration savings roll in this year and sort of hit steady state really going into '18. We see lower cash integration cost. We see lower cash interest expenses. We see some additional working capital performance improvements. And since we have closed about 15% of our floor space or about 2 million square feet, we do see some additional capital spending efficiencies as we get further out in time.

And we see the DoD business to be flat to up a little bit slightly going into next year. We ended the year around $70 million more or less in Q4. You see it in the back of the appendix in the DoD tactical business. We see that same cautious behavior continuing into next year. But then on top of that, we see tens of millions of opportunities in 2 areas, as Rahul mentioned, army modernization opportunities, which would include the MNVR opportunity as well as on MUOS, and that should bring us to flat to up slightly. We do see another step-down next year in the international business. We see that our pipeline still remains pretty healthy in that business. But we do see that business down sort of mid-teens going into next year. Not a lot really has changed in many ways since our Q3 release in terms of the overall sets of risks and opportunities that are still out there. We still see some good funding on the horizon. But we see that business down a little bit going into next year. And maybe, Noah, just to give you a little bit more color on this, as we look out into '17, we see about 1/3 of that business is in Europe, which, as you know, we've talked before, and '16 was coming off a pretty good record year. Eastern Europe and the Ukraine remain very, very solid. We still see that strong going into '17, but it will be down slightly from what was a record year. We see about 1/3 of the businesses in the Middle East and Africa, where we do expect to see a relatively slow pace to continue, revenue to be flat to down slightly. Iraq remains one of our biggest opportunities in the Middle East. There's another country in the Middle East, which you'll see a little bit of a recovery offset that. But again, that Middle East/Africa should be probably down slightly to flat next year. The balance of the business are about 10% to 50% each in AsiaPac and Australia. Australia should be -- that region should be flat to up a little bit because Australia is going to come in a little bit stronger next year. We see Central America, Latin America to be flat to up slightly a little bit. We do see Brazil a little bit weaker. We see Mexico a little bit stronger, with that region up a little bit. But really, as we look out into the next year, the big challenge we're facing is really in Central Asia and particular in Afghanistan as a pretty big program runs from lots of new radios in the past to more sustainment in '17 and beyond, and actually, the biggest piece of the headwind going into next year."

But on the other hand, your bookings keep trending to be relatively soft. You're talking about softer DoD, cautious buying behavior, which is not particularly consistent with, I guess, what a lot of other defense companies are saying. And so the point being, there's just sort of a lot of uncertainty around the growth trajectory beyond '17, recognizing that's not the most fair question given where you are. I don't know if there's any way you could speak to those inputs, even directionally, to give some people some comfort in that part of the model."

Within Critical Networks, we see our mission networks FAA business to be -- it was -- has been strong this past year, very strong in the second half of '16, continuing up next year, good international opportunities. So we see that continuing to grow going into next year. We think service is going to stabilize as we get beyond '17 and into '18. So it won't be as much of a drag. And then on the CS segment, we see that segment down next year. But when you look at 2 things; one, the pace of awards and actions happening on army modernization and SOCOM modernization, those activities are moving quickly. Our Rifleman Radio is now through both customer test and qual test. The Manpack radio is now through qualification test. They expect to go into delivery orders into the early part of our Harris fiscal '18. SOCOM moves -- is moving nicely. We do see substantial budget upticks in '17 from '16 as well then in '18 from '17, so very good strong funding support for that. On the international side, the pipeline remains very, very strong. The needs are out there. The funding is not moving at pace as we had expected, but there's strong need that's out there. The pipeline is pretty robust. And going out beyond '17, we see markets like Australia to be quite significant and be contributors as we into '18. So we still believe that '18 will be a growth year for Harris Corporation, and I think we're positioning ourselves well to grow in that time period."

So I won't really size or shape the tactical business for fiscal '17. On the pipelines, the DoD pipeline still remains pretty healthy. It's a $900 million to $1 billion size. We do start to see more of the modernization opportunity starting to come into the pipeline. On the international side, the pipeline remains about $2.6 billion, we said last time about $2.9 billion. The big opportunity we had in there that drove it to $2.9 billion was Australia, $600 million. We feel good about the opportunity. It's still out there. As we've gotten in detailed negotiations with Australia, they may split that into 2 pieces. They may do $300 million, $350 million at the back-end of our fiscal '17. The balance may slip out a little bit beyond that. And that was the key driver of bringing down our international pipeline to about $2.6 billion.

So our total deficit ended at $2.3 billion, up $100 million from 20 -- where we ended last year. It really has no impact on our contributions because that's kind of a different formula. Our total contributions will go up a little bit next year because discount rate at which we calculate with the contributions is coming down, and also the rate of return on assets need to be factored in.

Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 16.2%,",1142,"Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, and I'm pleased with our performance.
Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 on organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 16.2%, and free cash flow was strong at $772 million. Book-to-bill was greater than 1.
And we executed well against the key priorities we set out at the beginning of the year. First was to successfully integrate Exelis, a company which added scale, a broader portfolio of technologies, new market opportunities and improved operating resilience, and we're moving faster and achieving greater savings than initially expected. We exited fiscal '16, year 1 of integration, at a net savings run rate of $120 million, the top end of what we originally committed to by year 3. And we're tracking well towards achieving $140 million to $150 million net as we exit fiscal '17.
The second priority was to continue to reshape our portfolio. And in April, we saw the Aerostructures business we acquired with Exelis at an attractive multiple, using the proceeds to pay down debt.
The third priority was to maximize free cash flow when we exceeded our guidance of $750 million through tight management of capital spending and a 4-day improvement in working capital, absorbing over $100 million in cash, restructuring and integration costs and $174 million in cash pension contributions.
And finally, our fourth priority was to deleverage. And during the year, we retired $650 million in debt, about 1/3 of our 3-year debt reduction goal, allowing us to rebalance our capital deployment priorities as we reinitiate share repurchases in fiscal '17 with a placeholder of $150 million.
And we executed these priorities while also continuing to drive operational excellence deep into the company to lower costs and improved program execution, reinvesting some of the savings in R&D to drive future growth. Company-funded R&D was again, this year, a little more than 4% of revenue, a spending rate higher than our peers, and which has led to a number of important strategic wins.
So let me provide a few highlights in the quarter before Rahul discusses our detailed segment financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.45, up 10%, with results benefiting from the acquisition, a lower tax rate and improved operating performance. Operating profit was up 6% and margin improved by 190 basis points on organic revenue down 6%. Improved performance was driven by the capture of synergy savings, lower cost and solid execution within Space and Intelligence, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks, all contributing to higher income and higher margin.
Space and Intel had another terrific quarter with revenue up 10% and operating margin up 510 basis points, following an equally-impressive Q3, with continued strength in the classified area, including space superiority and protection. We're successfully leveraging our broader technology portfolio. And in the quarter, we were awarded a $104 million contract as prime in a new classified mission area that could potentially develop into another key franchise for Harris.
In the commercial space market, we're seeing the beginning of a recapitalization and fleet expansion cycle. Following an award in Q3 for a new 18-meter space reflector, we received, in the fourth quarter, a contract from Airbus for a 12-meter folded rib reflector for the European Space Agency's Biomass satellite. Our opportunity pipeline in this area remains robust heading into fiscal '17.
The Electronic Systems also delivered excellent results with revenue up 4%, driven by higher electronic warfare and counter IED sales, and 910 basis points of margin expansion. Electronic warfare was up in both Q3 and Q4, coming off a weak first half, and we continued to win modernizations on legacy platforms with orders for the year doubling over prior year. And significantly following the close of the quarter, ES received a 2-year $189 million contract from a country in the Middle East to provide the land forces with an integrated battle management system, showcasing our competitive strength as a prime contractor providing an integrated solution. The contract is for 1 brigade. But there are opportunities to add 3 more land brigades: sustainment, radios and an operations center to incorporate air, navy and ground force communications. This contract also positions us well for similar projects in other countries in the region.
And while Critical Networks was down 6%, it was better-than-expected. And strong cost controls and program execution, along with savings from prior quarter restructuring actions at CapRock, drove 310 basis points of margin expansion in this segment. On the other end of the spectrum, Communication Systems was weaker-than-expected with revenue down 24% and margins 250 basis points lower than prior year. Tactical Communications declined 29% with legacy Harris down 40% with book-to-bill of 0.92.
In the international market, funding remains relatively solid, but our $1.77 billion follow-on contract that supports foreign military sales took longer to finalize than expected and coupled with an overburdened administrative approval process for task orders caused several opportunities to stretch out beyond the end of the year. In July, we booked all the revenue that slipped from 4Q. The U.S. tactical market was also soft in the quarter as we're starting to see more cautious customer buying behavior in advance of a likely CR this fall. So while I'm disappointed by the fall-off in Communication Systems, I'm really proud of how the team responded to meet the earnings and cash flow guidance presented in our Q3 call, pointing to the operating resilience of the new post-acquisition Harris.
Today, we're initiating guidance for fiscal '17, reflecting continued progress and solid execution of our strategy. We expect earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90, flat to up 4%. On organic revenue, down 1% to 4%, with operating margin continuing to increase due to synergies, lower costs and pension tailwind and with another year of strong free cash flow. We've set fiscal '17 guidance expectations for tactical in line with the slower environment we're currently experiencing, and we believe we're being appropriately conservative in our estimates.
So before turning the call over to Rahul to provide some detailed segment results and guidance, I'd like to comment on the joint press release with JANA Partners issued earlier today. As a result of constructive engagement with JANA, we reached an agreement to appoint 2 mutually-agreed independent directors to our board. One will be announced in early September, and both will be nominated in our proxy for the October Annual Meeting. We have an ongoing dialogue with all of our shareholders, and we welcome their input. We have a long history of strong corporate governance, and we're firmly committed to maximizing long-term value for all of our shareholders. We look forward to the contributions that these 2 new directors will bring to the board.
So with that, let me turn it over to Rahul."

Organic revenue comparisons exclude Aerostructures an",1120,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis.
So turning now to segment detail on Slide 5 and comparisons to prior year pro forma results. Organic revenue comparisons exclude Aerostructures and just like prior quarters, are as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. Communication Systems segment revenue was $436 million and down 24% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 29% and public safety down 10%. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower tactical revenue in Northern Africa due to the expected completion of a large modernization tranche and by lower revenue in the Middle East. And even though the Middle East market remains relatively soft, revenue from the region was up sequentially. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $120 million and operating margin was still strong at 27.5%, even on much lower revenue. We ended the year with legacy tactical backlog of $402 million and slightly lower than the third quarter backlog of $419 million as a result of orders that pushed out from the $1.77 billion IDIQ from fourth quarter that Bill just referenced.
On Slide 11, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical orders, revenue and backlog.
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $529 million, up 10% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including in the area of space superiority and protection. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $83 million and operating margin was strong at 15.7% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.6%. In addition to the classified orders that Bill has already addressed, Harris was awarded a 3-year $38 million contract for advanced baseline imager spare modules for weather monitoring aboard NOAA's GOES-R satellites. This win is an excellent example of the complementary nature of combining Exelis' sense of capability for satellites with Harris' ground processing capability.
Turning to electronic systems on Slide 7. Revenue was $381 million and up 4% on an organic basis compared to prior year with higher revenue in electronic warfare and counter IED systems. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $73 million and operating margin was solid at 19.2% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.1%.
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 8. Revenue was $575 million and down 6% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset by lower revenue in IT services and from the wind-down of 2 major programs mentioned in previous earnings calls and lower revenue in CapRock's energy business. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $81 million and operating margin was 14.1%. Margin improvement was in large part driven by previous CapRock cost reduction actions that resulted in CapRock's energy business returning to profitability in the fourth quarter despite significantly-lower revenue than the third quarter.
So moving to Slides 9 and 10. Today, we are initiating fiscal GAAP EPS guidance in a range of $5.53 to $5.73 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $5.70 to $5.90. Non-GAAP EPS excludes about $30 million to $35 million of integration costs. To remind you, non-GAAP guidance still includes approximately $132 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition intangible amortization. Revenue is expected to be in a range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding Aerostructures. EPS guidance reflects a change in FAS accounting methodology. Today, we have used -- historically, we have used a single discount rate for calculating the interest and service cost associated with pension obligations. Beginning in fiscal '17, we will measure the FAS pension cost in a given year using a spot rate approach. We adopted this approach as we believe it provides a more precise measurement of our pension service and interest cost since it matches each year's individual spot rate to the projected cash flows in that year. We also reduced our expected pension asset rate of return assumption by 25 basis points to 7.75% for 2017. EPS guidance also includes $150 million in share repurchases plans during the year. Other EPS guidance details are outlined on Slide 9, including an expected tax rate of 31%, in line with fiscal '16 results. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $800 million in fiscal '17. We ended fiscal '16 with 49 days of working capital, a reduction of 4 days from the beginning of the year. Our fiscal '17 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance and CapEx spend of approximately $175 million.
Turning now to segment guidance. In Communication Systems, revenue is expected to be down 7% to 9% with significant decline in Tactical Communications and Public Safety trending higher.
Within Tactical Communications, Harris legacy DoD is expected to be flat to up and legacy international down in mid-teens. In legacy DoD, we expect fourth quarter's cautious buying behavior to continue. However, we also expect MUOS and initial Army modernization to contribute revenue in low tens of millions each. In legacy international, since the third quarter earnings call, our views have not changed significantly on where we expect areas of opportunity and challenges in fiscal '17. Overall, we expect revenue to be once again underpinned by FMS funding support for opportunities in Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Central Asia. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 29.5% to 30.5%, reflecting the impact of lower revenue, offset by synergies from Exelis acquisition.
In Space and Intelligence System, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% with continuing strength in classified and uptick in commercial space. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 16% to 17%.
In Electronic Systems, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% on an organic basis. Revenue will be higher in electronic warfare, driven by the growth in backlog in 2016 and in C4i given the recent significant $189 million win that Bill just referenced. Segment operating margin is expected to improve to a range of 20% to 21%.
In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 3% to 6% with mission network's revenue trending higher due to a solid FAA franchise and international air traffic management opportunities. This has been more than offset by continued weakness in CapRock Energy and still tough compares in IT services. For IT Services, we expect revenue to stabilize at approximately $225 million to $250 million a quarter. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 12% to 13%.
So now let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, excellent progress in a multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis and realize the full synergies and accretion. We'll continue to drive our operational excellence program to not only lower cost but also to streamline processes, improve program execution and increase customer satisfaction. And we'll continue to reinvest in R&D to grow our core franchises and address near adjacencies where technology and innovation are differentiators. An important part of our strategy to drive shareholder value is optimizing our business portfolio by focusing on investments in which technology provides differentiation. We dispassionately, objectively and aggressively assess which businesses strategically fit and are a better value to Harris, as well as which businesses may be a better value on their own or with a third party. When we believe a business is not core to our strategy to drive shareholder value, we undertake proactive steps, as evidenced by the recent sale of Aerostructures and the sale of our commercial health care and broadcast communications businesses in prior years. We'll continue to assess our portfolio with the goal of enhancing shareholder value creation.
And as Rahul just described, fiscal '17 guidance. While we still expect revenue headwinds to persist, we also expect additional acquisition savings and our continuing focus on lowering costs to result in higher fiscal '17 earnings. Our guidance anticipates a continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year and the spending constraints it typically creates until the budget is passed, especially on our shorter-cycle tactical business. Longer-term, we expect positive momentum in Space and Intel and Electronic Systems to continue. And we also anticipate a recovery in the tactical market, driven by Army and SOCOM modernizations as well as other international modernizations such as in Australia and in the Middle East and Northern Africa.
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

So it was down quite a bit year-over-year in the fourth quarter, probably around 35%; for the year in '16, down about 25%. With oil sitting down in the low 40s now, we see a bit of incremental pressure. Although there's some service companies out there that are expecting some recovery into '17 and maybe the back end of '17, we do see another step-down next year. We were sizing at about 25%. We took some pretty aggressive restructuring actions really over the last 12 months to 18 months, but you recall pretty significantly as we exited Q2. And those are starting to take hold. We lost money in CapRock Energy in Q3. We returned to profitability in Q4. And that's part of the reason why you see the CN segment, Critical Network segment, being a little more profitable in Q4. Part of it comes from some turnaround in the CapRock business. So I think we've sized it for next year. We expect to make money in CapRock Energy next year, but we do see another step-down in that segment again, about 25%. On the services side, we were down 10%, 11% in the services in the year, down about 22% in the services side, mission sustainment, which was about what we had expected, maybe a little bit better in Q4, but about what we expected. We do see another step-down next year, sort of in a high single-digit range. We have a pretty good pipeline of opportunities. We ended fiscal '16 in that business with a book-to-bill of 1. So we're holding backlog going into next year. We had previously said about 1/3 of that business was up for recompete, and it was going to put some pressure into '17. We're now guiding to that pressure into '17. But some of the recompetes are now behind us. I think we're faring pretty well. There's a few that are still ahead of us. What we're seeing here is that the recompetes, we're winning them. Where we do win them, they are coming as -- instead of single vendor, they are more multi-vendor or IDIQs instead of regular contracts. So we still have to compete for task orders. So we do still see some revenue pressure in '17 in services, but not quite at the downturn we saw in '16, Howard."

We feel good about how we delivered that, absorbing pretty substantial pension and cash integration costs. Very good improvement in working capital as we had signaled we would have. We continue to tightly manage our capital spending. So next year, we guided to about $800 million in free cash flow with a little bit of a step-up in capital spending, although we remain very, very tight on that at $175 million. We still see a path to getting to $1 billion by fiscal '19; that was a 3-year goal that we set out. And it comes from the same things we described before on this call. Certainly, the integration savings roll in this year and sort of hit steady state really going into '18. We see lower cash integration cost. We see lower cash interest expenses. We see some additional working capital performance improvements. And since we have closed about 15% of our floor space or about 2 million square feet, we do see some additional capital spending efficiencies as we get further out in time. So those are the still -- they still remain set to be the key drivers of hitting $1 billion in '19."

And we see the DoD business to be flat to up a little bit slightly going into next year. We ended the year around $70 million more or less in Q4. You see it in the back of the appendix in the DoD tactical business. We see that same cautious behavior continuing into next year. But then on top of that, we see tens of millions of opportunities in 2 areas, as Rahul mentioned, army modernization opportunities, which would include the MNVR opportunity as well as on MUOS, and that should bring us to flat to up slightly. We do see another step-down next year in the international business. We see that our pipeline still remains pretty healthy in that business. But we do see that business down sort of mid-teens going into next year. Not a lot really has changed in many ways since our Q3 release in terms of the overall sets of risks and opportunities that are still out there. We still see some good funding on the horizon. But we see that business down a little bit going into next year. And maybe, Noah, just to give you a little bit more color on this, as we look out into '17, we see about 1/3 of that business is in Europe, which, as you know, we've talked before, and '16 was coming off a pretty good record year. Eastern Europe and the Ukraine remain very, very solid. We still see that strong going into '17, but it will be down slightly from what was a record year. We see about 1/3 of the businesses in the Middle East and Africa, where we do expect to see a relatively slow pace to continue, revenue to be flat to down slightly. Iraq remains one of our biggest opportunities in the Middle East. There's another country in the Middle East, which you'll see a little bit of a recovery offset that. But again, that Middle East/Africa should be probably down slightly to flat next year. The balance of the business are about 10% to 50% each in AsiaPac and Australia. Australia should be -- that region should be flat to up a little bit because Australia is going to come in a little bit stronger next year. We see Central America, Latin America to be flat to up slightly a little bit. We do see Brazil a little bit weaker. We see Mexico a little bit stronger, with that region up a little bit. But really, as we look out into the next year, the big challenge we're facing is really in Central Asia and particular in Afghanistan as a pretty big program runs from lots of new radios in the past to more sustainment in '17 and beyond, and actually, the biggest piece of the headwind going into next year."

But on the other hand, your bookings keep trending to be relatively soft. You're talking about softer DoD, cautious buying behavior, which is not particularly consistent with, I guess, what a lot of other defense companies are saying. And so the point being, there's just sort of a lot of uncertainty around the growth trajectory beyond '17, recognizing that's not the most fair question given where you are. I don't know if there's any way you could speak to those inputs, even directionally, to give some people some comfort in that part of the model."

Within Critical Networks, we see our mission networks FAA business to be -- it was -- has been strong this past year, very strong in the second half of '16, continuing up next year, good international opportunities. So we see that continuing to grow going into next year. We think service is going to stabilize as we get beyond '17 and into '18. So it won't be as much of a drag. And then on the CS segment, we see that segment down next year. But when you look at 2 things; one, the pace of awards and actions happening on army modernization and SOCOM modernization, those activities are moving quickly. Our Rifleman Radio is now through both customer test and qual test. The Manpack radio is now through qualification test. They expect to go into delivery orders into the early part of our Harris fiscal '18. SOCOM moves -- is moving nicely. We do see substantial budget upticks in '17 from '16 as well then in '18 from '17, so very good strong funding support for that. On the international side, the pipeline remains very, very strong. The needs are out there. The funding is not moving at pace as we had expected, but there's strong need that's out there. The pipeline is pretty robust. And going out beyond '17, we see markets like Australia to be quite significant and be contributors as we into '18. So we still believe that '18 will be a growth year for Harris Corporation, and I think we're positioning ourselves well to grow in that time period."

We do start to see more of the modernization opportunity starting to come into the pipeline. On the international side, the pipeline remains about $2.6 billion, we said last time about $2.9 billion. The big opportunity we had in there that drove it to $2.9 billion was Australia, $600 million. We feel good about the opportunity. It's still out there. As we've gotten in detailed negotiations with Australia, they may split that into 2 pieces. They may do $300 million, $350 million at the back-end of our fiscal '17. The balance may slip out a little bit beyond that. And that was the key driver of bringing down our international pipeline to about $2.6 billion.

So our total deficit ended at $2.3 billion, up $100 million from 20 -- where we ended last year. It really has no impact on our contributions because that's kind of a different formula. Our total contributions will go up a little bit next year because discount rate at which we calculate with the contributions is coming down, and also the rate of return on assets need to be factored in.

Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, and I'm pleased with our performance.Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 on organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 16.2%,",1142,"Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, and I'm pleased with our performance.
Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 on organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 16.2%, and free cash flow was strong at $772 million. Book-to-bill was greater than 1.
And we executed well against the key priorities we set out at the beginning of the year. First was to successfully integrate Exelis, a company which added scale, a broader portfolio of technologies, new market opportunities and improved operating resilience, and we're moving faster and achieving greater savings than initially expected. We exited fiscal '16, year 1 of integration, at a net savings run rate of $120 million, the top end of what we originally committed to by year 3. And we're tracking well towards achieving $140 million to $150 million net as we exit fiscal '17.
The second priority was to continue to reshape our portfolio. And in April, we sold the Aerostructures business we acquired with Exelis at an attractive multiple, using the proceeds to pay down debt.
The third priority was to maximize free cash flow when we exceeded our guidance of $750 million through tight management of capital spending and a 4-day improvement in working capital, absorbing over $100 million in cash, restructuring and integration costs and $174 million in cash pension contributions.
And finally, our fourth priority was to deleverage. And during the year, we retired $650 million in debt, about 1/3 of our 3-year debt reduction goal, allowing us to rebalance our capital deployment priorities as we reinitiate share repurchases in fiscal '17 with a placeholder of $150 million.
And we executed these priorities while also continuing to drive operational excellence deep into the company to lower costs and improved program execution, reinvesting some of the savings in R&D to drive future growth. Company-funded R&D was again, this year, a little more than 4% of revenue, a spending rate higher than our peers, and which has led to a number of important strategic wins.
So let me provide a few highlights in the quarter before Rahul discusses our detailed segment financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.45, up 10%, with results benefiting from the acquisition, a lower tax rate and improved operating performance. Operating profit was up 6% and margin improved by 190 basis points on organic revenue down 6%. Improved performance was driven by the capture of synergy savings, lower cost and solid execution within Space and Intelligence, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks, all contributing to higher income and higher margin.
Space and Intel had another terrific quarter with revenue up 10% and operating margin up 510 basis points, following an equally-impressive Q3, with continued strength in the classified area, including space superiority and protection. We're successfully leveraging our broader technology portfolio. And in the quarter, we were awarded a $104 million contract as prime in a new classified mission area that could potentially develop into another key franchise for Harris.
In the commercial space market, we're seeing the beginning of a recapitalization and fleet expansion cycle. Following an award in Q3 for a new 18-meter space reflector, we received, in the fourth quarter, a contract from Airbus for a 12-meter folded rib reflector for the European Space Agency's Biomass satellite. Our opportunity pipeline in this area remains robust heading into fiscal '17.
The Electronic Systems also delivered excellent results with revenue up 4%, driven by higher electronic warfare and counter IED sales, and 910 basis points of margin expansion. Electronic warfare was up in both Q3 and Q4, coming off a weak first half, and we continued to win modernizations on legacy platforms with orders for the year doubling over prior year. And significantly following the close of the quarter, ES received a 2-year $189 million contract from a country in the Middle East to provide the land forces with an integrated battle management system, showcasing our competitive strength as a prime contractor providing an integrated solution. The contract is for 1 brigade. But there are opportunities to add 3 more land brigades: sustainment, radios and an operations center to incorporate air, navy and ground force communications. This contract also positions us well for similar projects in other countries in the region.
And while Critical Networks was down 6%, it was better-than-expected. And strong cost controls and program execution, along with savings from prior quarter restructuring actions at CapRock, drove 310 basis points of margin expansion in this segment. On the other end of the spectrum, Communication Systems was weaker-than-expected with revenue down 24% and margins 250 basis points lower than prior year. Tactical Communications declined 29% with legacy Harris down 40% with book-to-bill of 0.92.
In the international market, funding remains relatively solid, but our $1.77 billion follow-on contract that supports foreign military sales took longer to finalize than expected and coupled with an overburdened administrative approval process for task orders caused several opportunities to stretch out beyond the end of the year. In July, we booked all the revenue that slipped from 4Q. The U.S. tactical market was also soft in the quarter as we're starting to see more cautious customer buying behavior in advance of a likely CR this fall. So while I'm disappointed by the fall-off in Communication Systems, I'm really proud of how the team responded to meet the earnings and cash flow guidance presented in our Q3 call, pointing to the operating resilience of the new post-acquisition Harris.
Today, we're initiating guidance for fiscal '17, reflecting continued progress and solid execution of our strategy. We expect earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90, flat to up 4%. On organic revenue, down 1% to 4%, with operating margin continuing to increase due to synergies, lower costs and pension tailwind and with another year of strong free cash flow. We've set fiscal '17 guidance expectations for tactical in line with the slower environment we're currently experiencing, and we believe we're being appropriately conservative in our estimates.
So before turning the call over to Rahul to provide some detailed segment results and guidance, I'd like to comment on the joint press release with JANA Partners issued earlier today. As a result of constructive engagement with JANA, we reached an agreement to appoint 2 mutually-agreed independent directors to our board. One will be announced in early September, and both will be nominated in our proxy for the October Annual Meeting. We have an ongoing dialogue with all of our shareholders, and we welcome their input. We have a long history of strong corporate governance, and we're firmly committed to maximizing long-term value for all of our shareholders. We look forward to the contributions that these 2 new directors will bring to the board.
So with that, let me turn it over to Rahul."

Organic revenue comparisons exclude Aerostructures an",1119,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis.
So turning now to segment detail on Slide 5 and comparisons to prior year pro forma results. Organic revenue comparisons exclude Aerostructures and just like prior quarters, are as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal '15. Communication Systems segment revenue was $436 million and down 24% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 29% and public safety down 10%. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower tactical revenue in Northern Africa due to the expected completion of a large modernization tranche and by lower revenue in the Middle East. And even though the Middle East market remains relatively soft, revenue from the region was up sequentially. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $120 million and operating margin was still strong at 27.5%, even on much lower revenue. We ended the year with legacy tactical backlog of $402 million and slightly lower than the third quarter backlog of $419 million as a result of orders that pushed out from the $1.77 billion IDIQ from fourth quarter that Bill just referenced.
On Slide 11, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical orders, revenue and backlog.
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $529 million, up 10% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including in the area of space superiority and protection. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $83 million and operating margin was strong at 15.7% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.6%. In addition to the classified orders that Bill has already addressed, Harris was awarded a 3-year $38 million contract for advanced baseline imager spare modules for weather monitoring aboard NOAA's GOES-R satellites. This win is an excellent example of the complementary nature of combining Exelis' SENSOR capability for satellites with Harris' ground processing capability.
Turning to electronic systems on Slide 7. Revenue was $381 million and up 4% on an organic basis compared to prior year with higher revenue in electronic warfare and counter IED systems. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $73 million and operating margin was solid at 19.2% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.1%.
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 8. Revenue was $575 million and down 6% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset by lower revenue in IT services and from the wind-down of 2 major programs mentioned in previous earnings calls and lower revenue in CapRock's energy business. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $81 million and operating margin was 14.1%. Margin improvement was in large part driven by previous CapRock cost reduction actions that resulted in CapRock's energy business returning to profitability in the fourth quarter despite significantly-lower revenue than the third quarter.
So moving to Slides 9 and 10. Today, we are initiating fiscal GAAP EPS guidance in a range of $5.53 to $5.73 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $5.70 to $5.90. Non-GAAP EPS excludes about $30 million to $35 million of integration costs. To remind you, non-GAAP guidance still includes approximately $132 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition intangible amortization. Revenue is expected to be in a range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding Aerostructures. EPS guidance reflects a change in FAS accounting methodology. Today, we have used -- historically, we have used a single discount rate for calculating the interest and service cost associated with pension obligations. Beginning in fiscal '17, we will measure the FAS pension cost in a given year using a spot rate approach. We adopted this approach as we believe it provides a more precise measurement of our pension service and interest cost since it matches each year's individual spot rate to the projected cash flows in that year. We also reduced our expected pension asset rate of return assumption by 25 basis points to 7.75% for 2017. EPS guidance also includes $150 million in share repurchases plans during the year. Other EPS guidance details are outlined on Slide 9, including an expected tax rate of 31%, in line with fiscal '16 results. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $800 million in fiscal '17. We ended fiscal '16 with 49 days of working capital, a reduction of 4 days from the beginning of the year. Our fiscal '17 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance and CapEx spend of approximately $175 million.
Turning now to segment guidance. In Communication Systems, revenue is expected to be down 7% to 9% with significant decline in Tactical Communications and Public Safety trending higher.
Within Tactical Communications, Harris legacy DoD is expected to be flat to up and legacy international down in mid-teens. In legacy DoD, we expect fourth quarter's cautious buying behavior to continue. However, we also expect MUOS and initial Army modernization to contribute revenue in low tens of millions each. In legacy international, since the third quarter earnings call, our views have not changed significantly on where we expect areas of opportunity and challenges in fiscal '17. Overall, we expect revenue to be once again underpinned by FMS funding support for opportunities in Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Central Asia. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 29.5% to 30.5%, reflecting the impact of lower revenue, offset by synergies from Exelis acquisition.
In Space and Intelligence System, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% with continuing strength in classified and uptick in commercial space. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 16% to 17%.
In Electronic Systems, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% on an organic basis. Revenue will be higher in electronic warfare, driven by the growth in backlog in 2016 and in C4i given the recent significant $189 million win that Bill just referenced. Segment operating margin is expected to improve to a range of 20% to 21%.
In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 3% to 6% with mission network's revenue trending higher due to a solid FAA franchise and international air traffic management opportunities. This has been more than offset by continued weakness in CapRock Energy and still tough compares in IT services. For IT Services, we expect revenue to stabilize at approximately $225 million to $250 million a quarter. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 12% to 13%.
So now let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

Overall, fiscal '16 was a solid year, excellent progress in a multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis and realize the full synergies and accretion. We'll continue to drive our operational excellence program to not only lower cost but also to streamline processes, improve program execution and increase customer satisfaction. And we'll continue to reinvest in R&D to grow our core franchises and address near adjacencies where technology and innovation are differentiators. An important part of our strategy to drive shareholder value is optimizing our business portfolio by focusing on investments in which technology provides differentiation. We dispassionately, objectively and aggressively assess which businesses strategically fit and are a better value to Harris, as well as which businesses may be a better value on their own or with a third party. When we believe a business is not core to our strategy to drive shareholder value, we undertake proactive steps, as evidenced by the recent sale of Aerostructures and the sale of our commercial health care and broadcast communications businesses in prior years. We'll continue to assess our portfolio with the goal of enhancing shareholder value creation.
And as Rahul just described, fiscal '17 guidance. While we still expect revenue headwinds to persist, we also expect additional acquisition savings and our continuing focus on lowering costs to result in higher fiscal '17 earnings. Our guidance anticipates a continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year and the spending constraints it typically creates until the budget is passed, especially on our shorter-cycle tactical business. Longer-term, we expect positive momentum in Space and Intel and Electronic Systems to continue. And we also anticipate a recovery in the tactical market, driven by Army and SOCOM modernizations as well as other international modernizations such as in Australia and in the Middle East and Northern Africa.
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions."

The -- we exit the year about what we thought, about $60 million in the quarter in CapRock Energy. So it was down quite a bit year-over-year in the fourth quarter, probably around 35%; for the year in '16, down about 25%. With oil sitting down in the low 40s now, we see a bit of incremental pressure. Although there's some service companies out there that are expecting some recovery into '17 and maybe the back end of '17, we do see another step-down next year. We were sizing at about 25%. We took some pretty aggressive restructuring actions really over the last 12 months to 18 months, but you recall pretty significantly as we exited Q2. And those are starting to take hold. We lost money in CapRock Energy in Q3. We returned to profitability in Q4. And that's part of the reason why you see the CN segment, Critical Network segment, being a little more profitable in Q4. Part of it comes from some turnaround in the CapRock business. So I think we've sized it for next year. We expect to make money in CapRock Energy next year, but we do see another step-down in that segment again, about 25%. On the services side, we were down 10%, 11% in the services in the year, down about 22% in the services side, mission sustainment, which was about what we had expected, maybe a little bit better in Q4, but about what we expected. We do see another step-down next year, sort of in a high single-digit range. We have a pretty good pipeline of opportunities. We ended fiscal '16 in that business with a book-to-bill of 1. So we're holding backlog going into next year. We had previously said about 1/3 of that business was up for recompete, and it was going to put some pressure into '17. We're now guiding to that pressure into '17. But some of the recompetes are now behind us. I think we're faring pretty well. There's a few that are still ahead of us. What we're seeing here is that the recompetes, we're winning them. Where we do win them, they are coming as -- instead of single vendor, they are more multi-vendor or IDIQs instead of regular contracts. So we still have to compete for task orders. So we do still see some revenue pressure in '17 in services, but not quite at the downturn we saw in '16, Howard."

We continue to tightly manage our capital spending. So next year, we guided to about $800 million in free cash flow with a little bit of a step-up in capital spending, although we remain very, very tight on that at $175 million. We still see a path to getting to $1 billion by fiscal '19; that was a 3-year goal that we set out. And it comes from the same things we described before on this call. Certainly, the integration savings roll in this year and sort of hit steady state really going into '18. We see lower cash integration cost. We see lower cash interest expenses. We see some additional working capital performance improvements. And since we have closed about 15% of our floor space or about 2 million square feet, we do see some additional capital spending efficiencies as we get further out in time. So those are the still -- they still remain set to be the key drivers of hitting $1 billion in '19."

And we see the DoD business to be flat to up a little bit slightly going into next year. We ended the year around $70 million more or less in Q4. You see it in the back of the appendix in the DoD tactical business. We see that same cautious behavior continuing into next year. But then on top of that, we see tens of millions of opportunities in 2 areas, as Rahul mentioned, army modernization opportunities, which would include the MNVR opportunity as well as on MUOS, and that should bring us to flat to up slightly. We do see another step-down next year in the international business. We see that our pipeline still remains pretty healthy in that business. But we do see that business down sort of mid-teens going into next year. Not a lot really has changed in many ways since our Q3 release in terms of the overall sets of risks and opportunities that are still out there. We still see some good funding on the horizon. But we see that business down a little bit going into next year. And maybe, Noah, just to give you a little bit more color on this, as we look out into '17, we see about 1/3 of that business is in Europe, which, as you know, we've talked before, and '16 was coming off a pretty good record year. Eastern Europe and the Ukraine remain very, very solid. We still see that strong going into '17, but it will be down slightly from what was a record year. We see about 1/3 of the businesses in the Middle East and Africa, where we do expect to see a relatively slow pace to continue, revenue to be flat to down slightly. Iraq remains one of our biggest opportunities in the Middle East. There's another country in the Middle East, which you'll see a little bit of a recovery offset that. But again, that Middle East/Africa should be probably down slightly to flat next year. The balance of the business are about 10% to 15% each in AsiaPac and Australia. Australia should be -- that region should be flat to up a little bit because Australia is going to come in a little bit stronger next year. We see Central America, Latin America to be flat to up slightly a little bit. We do see Brazil a little bit weaker. We see Mexico a little bit stronger, with that region up a little bit. But really, as we look out into the next year, the big challenge we're facing is really in Central Asia, in particular in Afghanistan, as a pretty big program runs from lots of new radios in the past to more sustainment in '17 and beyond, and that's really the biggest piece of the headwind going into next year."

But on the other hand, your bookings keep trending to be relatively soft. You're talking about softer DoD, cautious buying behavior, which is not particularly consistent with, I guess, what a lot of other defense companies are saying. And so the point being, there's just sort of a lot of uncertainty around the growth trajectory beyond '17, recognizing that's not the most fair question given where you are. I don't know if there's any way you could speak to those inputs, even directionally, to give some people some comfort in that part of the model."

That's Electronic Systems and Space and Intel. So those are performing very, very well, and we expect that they continue. Within Critical Networks, we see our mission networks FAA business to be -- it was -- has been strong this past year, very strong in the second half of '16, continuing up next year, good international opportunities. So we see that continuing to grow going into next year. We think service is going to stabilize as we get beyond '17 and into '18. So it won't be as much of a drag. And then on the CS segment, we see that segment down next year. But when you look at 2 things; one, the pace of awards and actions happening on army modernization and SOCOM modernization, those activities are moving quickly. Our Rifleman Radio is now through both customer test and qual test. The Manpack radio is now through qualification test. They expect to go into delivery orders into the early part of our Harris fiscal '18. SOCOM moves -- is moving nicely. We do see substantial budget upticks in '17 from '16 as well then in '18 from '17, so very good strong funding support for that. On the international side, the pipeline remains very, very strong. The needs are out there. The funding is not moving at pace as we had expected, but there's strong need that's out there. The pipeline is pretty robust. And going out beyond '17, we see markets like Australia to be quite significant and big contributors as we into '18.

Look, I'm not going to give much color around book-to-bill for the year. For the company, overall, we do see a slightly better back half than front half, simply just by the nature of the expectations that a CR is going to be slightly back-end loaded, but not much unusual from what we've seen in the prior years, may be a tick-up in the back half from what we've seen before. So I won't really size or shape the tactical business for fiscal '17. On the pipelines, the DoD pipeline still remains pretty healthy. It's in the $900 million to $1 billion size. We do start to see more of the modernization opportunity starting to come into the pipeline. On the international side, the pipeline remains about $2.6 billion, we said last time about $2.9 billion. The big opportunity we had in there that drove it to $2.9 billion was Australia, $600 million. We feel good about the opportunity. It's still out there. As we've gotten in detailed negotiations with Australia, they may split that into 2 pieces. They may do $300 million, $350 million at the back-end of our fiscal '17. The balance may slip out a little bit beyond that. And that was the key driver of bringing down our international pipeline to about $2.6 billion. But it's still sitting at a very robust level, which gives us some confidence of growth in fiscal '18 as a company overall."

So our total pension deficit, Gautam, increased by about $100 million to $2.3 billion from $2.2 billion, and this includes both the pension and the OPEB liabilities. So we previously said that our pension liabilities increase about roughly $180-ish million for every 25 basis points reduction in discount rate. And the discount rate changed by 40 basis points, but that was partially offset by the contributions we had made and certain changes in the postretirement benefits. So our total deficit ended at $2.3 billion, up $100 million from 20 -- where we ended last year. It really has no impact on our contributions because that's kind of a different formula. Our total contributions will go up a little bit next year because discount rate at which we calculate with the contributions is coming down, and also the rate of return on assets need to be factored in. So contributions are up about $10 million, $15 million year-over-year. But that also gets offset by the CAS reimbursements that we get from the government."

Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal 2017 with a good start out of the gate, and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're doing on them. As part of",1262,"Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal 2017 with a good start out of the gate, and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're doing on them. As part of an ongoing initiative to optimize our business portfolio, we announced earlier this morning a definitive agreement to sell the CapRock commercial business for $425 million and plan to use the proceeds to pay down debt and repurchase shares. Portfolio shaping supports our strategy to invest in businesses where Harris can provide technology differentiation. And we'll continue to review our portfolio and objectively assess which businesses are a strategic fit and which businesses have better value under a different ownership structure. 
We also remain committed to smart and balanced capital deployment, and in the first quarter, we used $100 million in cash to repurchase shares and we increased the dividend 6%, our 15th consecutive annual increase. We also repaid $33 million in term debt, and in early October retired a $250 million bond that was due, making further progress towards our 3-year debt reduction goal of $2 billion, and we're about halfway there. 
We remain laser focused on Exelis integration in capturing synergies and related accretion, and through Q1, we're tracking wealth towards capturing $50 million of additional savings and achieving our target of $140 million to $150 million in run rate savings as we exit fiscal '17. And while all integration projects are complete and are well underway, we'll continue to find ways to lower cost and driving productivity as part of our normal operational excellence agenda. 
And then finally, investing in R&D and new product development to grow core franchises and extending the close adjacencies has been an important part of our strategy. And in the first quarter, R&D spending was up 7% and over 4% of revenue. For the year, we still expect to spend at about 4% of revenue, similar to fiscal '16 and at a level well above our peers. 
So turning now to Q1 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a $1.39, up 6% on a 2% organic revenue decline. Despite the revenue headwind and higher R&D spending in the quarter, operating margin increased 50 basis points as a result of higher synergies, productivity savings and pension income. Earnings per share also benefited from a lower tax rate in the first quarter. Revenue reflected continued growth in space and Intel, up 4% and Electronic Systems, up 2%, while communications systems was down 5% and Critical Networks was down 7%. 
Orders were particularly strong with total company book-to-bill of 1.17 and funded backlog up 6% over the prior quarter. Book-to-bill for each segment was above 1, and within communications systems, we saw strong recovery in our legacy tactical business where book-to-bill was 1.22. Healthy bookings plus several opportunities that slipped from the back half of fiscal '16 threw a backlog up 16% sequentially to $467 million and higher in both DoD and international. 
Q1 revenue in legacy tactical was also encouraging at down 1% with DoD revenue up 4% and international down 4%. Within DoD, higher first quarter revenue was primarily related to achieving important milestones early in the year for MNVR and MUOS. We received a limited rate production authorization on MNVR, which is our midtier network radio; and formal NSA certification for running the MUOS satellite wave form on existing Falcon III 117Gs which triggered initial fielding of MUOS capability. 
Also in the quarter, the Army contracted Harris to develop the narrowband mode for the Soldier Radio Waveform or SRW, a requirement for all Army modernization radios, the Manpack the Rifleman the MNVR and the future or small airborne networking radio. This contract demonstrates Harris' leadership and expertise in adapting complex waveforms to meet the changing requirements of the Army's tactical network. 
In legacy international, revenue trended favorably against our full year guidance and was higher in Europe, Central and Latin America or CALA and Asia Pacific but was offset, as anticipated, by lower revenue in Central Asia and the Middle East Africa regions. You'll recall that Europe was strong in fiscal '16, driven primarily by Eastern European countries, and that trend continued in Q1 with encouraging signs for the balance of the year. The CALA region is benefiting from the country's modernization of next-gen radios and a new $90 million contract win from U.S. Southern command supporting counter narcotics missions in Latin America. And in Asia Pac, we're supplying HF and multiband radio to support maritime capability in the Southeast Asian country as part of an ongoing trend of the U.S. ball stream partner capabilities in the region and a significant opportunity remains on the horizon in Australia. So overall, regional trends of strength and headwinds attracting about as we laid out in our 3Q and 4Q earnings calls and, while still early in the year, represents a good start towards achieving our full year guidance. 
Turning to space and Intel. We have another quarter of excellent wins from customers in the intelligence community which continues to be a solid growth area for the company. In the quarter, Harris won a $25 million initial contract to develop a multimission small satellite for a classified customer or second government win in this area. SmallSats are emerging as the low cost solution to a rapidly changing environment offering a shorter development cycle and launched at a fraction of a cost and lead time of a large exclusive satellite. Our offering in this growing niche is powerful, combining a portfolio of advanced sensors, software-defined radio technology to support onboard and mission changes and Harris' agility to quickly innovate as threats evolve. 
We also continue to build on our franchise in Space Superiority. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was selected for $53 million in follow-on work to provide counter communication capabilities that detect adversary interference and take action to protect our space assets. This new win will bring contracts to date for this mission to about $200 million. 
And then outside the intelligence community, we received a $90 million follow-on contract to provide navigation payload for GPS space 3 space vehicle 9 and 10. We're already under contract to deliver payloads for SD [ph] 1 through 8 and we're investing to develop a fully digital solution for 11 through 32. 
Turning to Electronic Systems. Q1 marked the third consecutive quarter of strong bookings for electronic warfare, winning modernizations on legacy platforms where we have strong incumbency positions. And as the EW capability gap between the U.S. and peer countries has narrowed, modernization on deployed fleets have become a higher priority. We've included a $22 million contract for the B-1B and a 3-year $55 million contract to redesign the electronic warfare system for the B-52. B-52 wins over last 2 years now stand at about $200 million, and we continue to see strong future opportunities on fleets with long modernization tails. 
In Critical Networks, Harris expanded its reach into a new market by leveraging a strong and long successful of history with the FEA for designing and maintaining highly secure communication networks. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a 14-year $700 million ceiling IDIQ from the state of Florida to provide a statewide secure communications network. This network called my Florida net 2 will have about 4,000 sites connecting public safety, law enforcement and other state and local government agencies. 
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Rahul for more financial detail and guidance. Rahul?"

Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and supplements to GAAP results in our other quarterly earnings materials. Turning now to segment details on Slide 4. Communications systems segment r",587,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and supplements to GAAP results in our other quarterly earnings materials. 
Turning now to segment details on Slide 4. Communications systems segment revenue was $431 million and down 5% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 6% primarily as a result of lower international sales. Public Safety was down 1%. Operating income was $119 million compared with $138 million in the prior year, driven by lower volume and mix. 
On Slide 10, we have a gain including historical information for legacy tactical, orders, revenue and backlog. 
Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 5. Revenue was $453 million and up 4% compared to prior year. This was driven by higher revenue from intelligence community customers and from radiation budget instrument program called RBI to provide sensors for monitoring climate change and global warming on NASA joint satellite system. Operating income was $80 million compared with $68 million in the prior year, driven by continued strong program performance and higher pension income. 
Electronic Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $361 million and up 2% on an organic basis compared to prior year excluding $90 million of revenue from Aerostructures business that was divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal '16. Higher revenue from initial ramp of recently awarded integrated Battle Management Systems in Middle East and from electronic warfare solutions was partially offset by lower wireless products sales. Operating income was $74 million compared with $69 million in the prior year. In addition to the electronic warfare contract that Bill mentioned, Harris received $35 million in follow-on contract for the F-35 program. 
Critical Networks on Slide 7. Revenue was $527 million and down 7% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from SA's NextGen modernization program was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services down $20 million and in CapRock's commercial business down $25 million. IT Services revenue was in line with expectations of it stabilizing in the $225 million to $250 million fourth quarter range. And CapRock commercial is now at approximately $75 million per quarter. Operating income was $66 million compared with $63 million in the prior year. 
On top of what was already mentioned, Harris was awarded a 5-year $125 million, single award IDIQ for IT Services from a classified customer. This extends a 25-year relationship and reflects a business development focus in the intelligence community. 
Moving to Slides 8 and 9. Fiscal '17 guidance remains unchanged with GAAP EPS guidance in a range of $1.553 to $1.573 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.570 to $1.590. As previously communicated, EPS guidance reflects $150 million in share repurchases for the year. Total company revenue guidance is unchanged in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding revenue from Aerostructures divestiture. The segment and other details outlined in the side also remain unchanged including generating an expected $800 million in free cash flow for the full year. Although the first quarter tax rate was 27.5%, we still expect a full year tax rate of 31%. Our expected 31% rate reflected adoption of a new accounting standard with stock compensation and the benefit of it primarily in the first quarter. The remaining 3 quarters are expected to average 32% weighting quarter-to-quarter depending on tax timing differences. We will update fiscal '17 guidance once CapRock transaction closes. 
Now I will hand it back to Bill for a few closing comments."

Saudi continues at a relatively low level, '16 came down from '15, but we don't see a big step down in '17. Right now it's running at a relatively low level as we see it. There's some pressure in Iraq just because of the strike in the country but the opportunity we see on the horizon in Iraq are very, very sizable.

So we feel very good about the progress there and our position on that particular opportunity. On the Manpack, it continues to progress. We are one of 3 awardees. They're a very sizable contract. We complete the qualification tests. The customer testing should happen early in fiscal '17, so in the next 3 or 4 months. And then it will go into a delivery order procurement we'll be made by -- decision would be made by August, I believe, of next year with deliveries off of that starting about a year from now and then continuing into early calendar '18. So that has not moved out in terms of the delivery time frame on the back end. On the other one which was -- which is important is Rifleman. We're one of 2 vendors and you recall is a $3.9 billion IDIQ. We've gotten through a quality test ad customer test. It was for a single channel radio, but if you recall, they left a big part of the overall value with an opportunity for a 2-channel radio, and it does sound like the Army is looking to perhaps accelerate the purchase of a 2-channel radio. They saw the opportunity with the radio we have was SOCOM, which is a single vendor aware that we have at Harris Corporation. They saw the radio. There's a possibility they will accelerate the purchase of a 2-channel radio. I think it would be relatively good news for Harris since we're well positioned on that particular opportunity. And you saw in Q1 or as I mentioned in Q1 that we have a milestone approval of the mid tier radio with half of the opportunity recognized in Q1. The other half will come sometime later in our fiscal 17. So well, overall, I think good progress. MUOS, we're very pleased with receiving NSA cert and to seek initial fielding of that capability. Keep in mind, there's 30,000, 117Gs in the field that have the possibility being upgraded with the MUOS waveform. And as that happens, since the development is all behind us and it's a software load, it comes down to us at a relatively high margin, so all of which I think is good progress in the quarter, Gautam. The last one I would mention is on SOCOM, I think it's a very important one. That's a 2-channel radio and that continues to progress.

Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal '17 with a good start out of the gate, and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're delivering on them. As part",1254,"Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal '17 with a good start out of the gate, and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're delivering on them. As part of an ongoing initiative to optimize our business portfolio, we announced earlier this morning a definitive agreement to sell the CapRock Commercial business for $425 million and plan to use the proceeds to pay down debt and repurchase shares. Portfolio shaping supports our strategy to invest in businesses where Harris can provide technology differentiation. And we'll continue to review our portfolio and objectively assess which businesses are strategic fit and which businesses have better value under a different ownership structure.
We also remain committed to smart and balanced capital deployment, and in the first quarter, we used $100 million in cash to repurchase shares and we increased the dividend 6%, our 15th consecutive annual increase. We also repaid $33 million in term debt, and in early October we retired a $250 million bond that was due, making further progress towards our 3-year debt reduction goal of $2 billion, and we're about halfway there.
We remain laser focused on Exelis integration in capturing synergies and related accretion, and through Q1, we're tracking well towards capturing $50 million of additional annual saving, and achieving our target of $140 million to $150 million in run rate savings as we exit fiscal '17. And while all integration projects are complete or well underway, we'll continue to find ways to lower cost and drive productivity as part of our normal operational excellence agenda.
And then finally, investing in R&D and new product development to grow core franchises and extending the close adjacencies has been an important part of our strategy. And in the first quarter, R&D spending was up 7% and over 4% of revenue. For the year, we still expect to spend about 4% of revenue, similar to fiscal '16 and at a level well above our peers.
So turning now to Q1 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.39, up 6% on a 2% organic revenue decline. Despite the revenue headwind and higher R&D spending in the quarter, operating margin increased 50 basis points as a result of higher synergies, productivity savings and pension income. Earnings per share also benefited from a lower tax rate in the first quarter.
Revenue reflected continued growth in Space and Intel, up 4% and Electronic Systems, up 2%, while Communications Systems was down 5% and Critical Networks was down 7%.
Orders were particularly strong with total company book-to-bill of 1.17 and funded backlog of 6% over the prior quarter. Book-to-bill for each segment was above 1, and within Communications Systems, we saw a strong recovery in our legacy tactical business where book-to-bill was 1.22. Healthy bookings plus several opportunities that slipped from the back half of fiscal '16 throw a backlog of 16% sequentially to $467 million and higher in both DoD and international.
Q1 revenue in legacy tactical was also encouraging at down 1% with DoD revenue up 4% and international down 4%. Within DoD, higher first quarter revenue was primarily related to achieving important milestones early in the year for MNVR and MUOS. We received a limited rate production authorization on MNVR, which is our mid-tier networking radio; and formal NSA certification for running the MUOS satellite wave form on existing Falcon III 117Gs, which triggered initial fielding of MUOS capability.
Also in the quarter, the Army contracted Harris to develop the narrowband mode for the Soldier Radio Waveform or SRW, a requirement for all Army modernization radios, the Manpack, the Rifleman, the MNVR and the future SANR or Small Airborne Networking Radio. This contract demonstrates Harris' leadership and expertise in adapting complex waveforms to meet the changing requirements of the Army's tactical network.
In legacy international, revenue trended favorably against our full year guidance and was higher in Europe, Central and Latin America or CALA and Asia Pacific, but was offset, as anticipated, by lower revenue in Central Asia and Middle East Africa regions.
You'll recall that Europe was strong in fiscal '16, driven primarily by Eastern European countries, and that trend continued in Q1 with encouraging signs for the balance of the year. The CALA region is benefiting from the country's modernization of next-gen radios and a new $90 million contract win from U.S. Southern command supporting counter narcotics missions in Latin America. And in Asia Pac, we're supplying HF and multiband radio to support maritime capability in the Southeast Asian country as part of an ongoing trend of the U.S. bolstering partner capabilities in the region and a significant opportunity remains on the horizon in Australia. So overall, regional trends of strength and headwinds attracting about as we laid out in our 3Q and 4Q earnings calls and while still early in the year, represents a good start towards achieving our full year guidance. 
Turning to Space and Intel. We've another quarter of excellent wins from customers in the intelligence community which continues to be a solid growth area for the company. In the quarter, Harris won a $25 million initial contract to develop a multimission small satellite for a classified customer, our second government win in this area. SmallSats are emerging as a low cost solution to a rapidly changing threat environment, offering a shorter development cycle and launched at a fraction of the cost and lead time of a large exclusive satellite. Our offering in this growing niche is powerful, combining a portfolio of advanced sensors, software-defined radio technology to support onboard and mission changes and Harris' agility to quickly innovate as threats evolve.
We also continue to build on our franchise in Space Superiority. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was selected for $53 million in follow-on work to provide counter communication capabilities that detect adversary interference and take action to protect our space assets. This new win will bring contracts to date for this mission to about $200 million.
And then outside the intelligence community, we received a $90 million follow-on contract to provide navigation payloads for GPS phase 3 space vehicles 9 and 10. We're already under contract to deliver payloads for SD 1 through 8 and we're investing to develop a fully digital solution for 11 through 32. 
Turning to Electronic Systems. Q1 marked the third consecutive quarter of strong bookings for electronic warfare, winning modernizations on legacy platforms where we've strong incumbency positions. And as the EW capability gap between the U.S. and peer countries has narrowed, modernizations on deployed fleets have become a higher priority. We've included a $22 million contract for the B-1B and a 3-year $55 million contract to redesign the electronic warfare system for the B-52. B-52 wins over last 2 years now stand at about $200 million, and we continue to see strong future opportunities on fleets with long modernization tails.
In Critical Networks, Harris expanded its reach into a new market by leveraging a strong and long successful history with the FAA for designing and maintaining highly secure communication networks.
Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a 14-year $700 million ceiling IDIQ from the state of Florida to provide a statewide secure communications network. This network called MyFloridaNet-2 will have about 4,000 sites connecting public safety, law enforcement and other state and local government agencies.
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Rahul for more financial detail and guidance. Rahul?"

Communication systems segment re",590,"Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and supplements GAAP results in our other quarterly earnings materials.
Turning now to segment details on Slide 4. Communication systems segment revenue was $431 million and down 5% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 6% primarily as a result of lower international SINCGARS sales. Public Safety was down 1%. Operating income was $119 million compared with $138 million in the prior year, driven by lower volume and mix.
On Slide 10, we have a gain included historical information for legacy tactical, orders, revenue and backlog.
Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 5. Revenue was $453 million and up 4% compared to prior year. This was driven by higher revenue from intelligence community customers and from Radiation Budget Instrument program called RBI to provide sensors for monitoring climate change and global warming on NASA's Joint Polar Satellite System. Operating income was $80 million compared with $68 million in the prior year, driven by continued strong program performance and higher pension income.
Electronic Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $361 million and up 2% on an organic basis compared to prior year excluding $90 million of revenue from Aerostructures business that was divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal '16.
Higher revenue from initial ramp of recently awarded integrated Battle Management Systems in Middle East and from electronic warfare solutions was partially offset by lower wireless product sales. Operating income was $74 million compared with $69 million in the prior year. In addition to the electronic warfare contract that Bill mentioned, Harris received $35 million in follow-on contract for the F-35 program.
Critical Networks on Slide 7. Revenue was $527 million and down 7% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization program was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services down $30 million and in CapRock's commercial business down $25 million. IT Services revenue was in line with expectations of it stabilizing in the $225 million to $250 million per quarter range. And CapRock Commercial is now at approximately $75 million per quarter. Operating income was $66 million compared with $63 million in the prior year.
On top of what was already mentioned, Harris was awarded a 5-year $125 million, single award IDIQ for IT Services from a classified customer. This extends a 25-year relationship and reflects a business development focus in the intelligence community.
Moving to Slides 8 and 9. Fiscal '17 guidance remains unchanged with GAAP EPS guidance in a range of $1.553 to $1.573 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.570 to $1.590. As previously communicated, EPS guidance reflects $150 million in share repurchases for the year.
Total company revenue guidance is unchanged in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding revenue from Aerostructures divestiture. Outlook for segment and other details outlined in the side also remain unchanged including generating an expected $800 million in free cash flow for the full year.
Although the first quarter tax rate was 27.5%, we still expect a full year tax rate of 31%.

In Jordan, we booked an order here in the first quarter. We see opportunities on the horizon. Saudi continues at a relatively low level, '16 came down from '15, but we don't see a big step down in '17. Right now it's running at a relatively low level as we see it. There's some pressure in Iraq just because of the strike in the country, but the opportunity we see on the horizon in Iraq are very, very sizable.

So we feel very good about the progress there and our position on that particular opportunity. On the Manpack, it continues to progress. We are one of 3 awardees. They're very sizable contract. We completed the qualification tests. The customer testing should happen early in fiscal '17, so in the next 3 or 4 months. And then it will go into a delivery order procurement we'll be, might made by -- decision would be made by August, I believe, of next year with deliveries off of that starting about a year from now and then continuing into early calendar '18. So that has not moved out in terms of the delivery time frame on the back end. On the other one which was -- which is important is Rifleman. We're one of 2 vendors that's in Telus, and you recall it's a $3.9 billion IDIQ. We've gotten through qual test and customer test. It was for a single channel radio, but if you recall, they left a big part of the overall award value with an opportunity for a 2-channel radio, and it does sound like the Army is looking to perhaps accelerate the purchase of a 2-channel radio. They saw the opportunity with the radio we have with SOCOM, which is a single vendor award that we have at Harris Corporation. They saw the radio. There's a possibility they will accelerate the purchase of a 2-channel radio. I think it would be relatively good news for Harris since we're well positioned on that particular opportunity. And you saw in Q1 or as I mentioned in Q1 that we got a milestone sea approval on the mid-tier radio with half of the opportunity recognized in Q1. The other half will come some time later in our fiscal '17. So, overall, I think good progress. MUOS, we're very pleased with receiving NSA cert and to see initial fielding of that capability. Keep in mind, there's 30,000, 117Gs in the field that have the possibility being upgraded with the MUOS waveform. And as that happens, since the development is all behind us and it's a software load, it comes down to us at a relatively high margin. So all of which I think is good progress in the quarter, Gautam. The last one I would mention is on SOCOM, I think it's a very important one. That's a 2-channel radio and that continues to progress.

Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal '17 with a good start out of the gate, and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're delivering on them. As part",1257,"Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal '17 with a good start out of the gate, and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're delivering on them. As part of an ongoing initiative to optimize our business portfolio, we announced earlier this morning a definitive agreement to sell the CapRock Commercial business for $425 million and plan to use the proceeds to pay down debt and repurchase shares. Portfolio shaping supports our strategy to invest in businesses where Harris can provide technology differentiation. And we'll continue to review our portfolio and objectively assess which businesses are a strategic fit and which businesses have better value under a different ownership structure.
We also remain committed to smart and balanced capital deployment, and in the first quarter, we used $100 million in cash to repurchase shares and we increased the dividend 6%, our 15th consecutive annual increase. We also repaid $33 million in term debt, and in early October we retired a $250 million bond that was due, making further progress towards our 3-year debt reduction goal of $2 billion, and we're about halfway there.
We remain laser focused on Exelis' integration and capturing synergies and related accretion, and through Q1, we're tracking well towards capturing $50 million of additional in-year saving, and achieving our target of $140 million to $150 million in run rate savings as we exit fiscal '17. And while all integration projects are complete or well underway, we'll continue to find ways to lower cost and drive productivity as part of our normal operational excellence agenda.
And then finally, investing in R&D and new product development to grow core franchises and expanding the close adjacencies has been an important part of our strategy. And in the first quarter, R&D spending was up 7% and over 4% of revenue. For the year, we still expect to spend about 4% of revenue, similar to fiscal '16 and at a level well above our peers.
So turning now to Q1 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.39, up 6% on a 2% organic revenue decline. Despite the revenue headwind and higher R&D spending in the quarter, operating margin increased 50 basis points as a result of higher synergies, productivity savings and pension income. Earnings per share also benefited from a lower tax rate in the first quarter.
Revenue reflected continued growth in Space and Intel, up 4%, and Electronic Systems up 2%, while Communications Systems was down 5% and Critical Networks was down 7%.
Orders were particularly strong with total company book-to-bill of 1.17 and funded backlog of 6% over the prior quarter. Book-to-bill for each segment was above 1, and within Communications Systems, we saw a strong recovery in our legacy tactical business where book-to-bill was 1.22. Healthy bookings plus several opportunities that slipped from the back half of fiscal '16 drew our backlog up 16% sequentially to $467 million and higher in both DoD and international.
Q1 revenue in legacy tactical was also encouraging at down 1% with DoD revenue up 4% and international down 4%. Within DoD, higher first quarter revenue was primarily related to achieving important milestones early in the year for MNVR and MUOS. We received a limited rate production authorization on MNVR, which is our mid-tier networking radio; and formal NSA certification for running the MUOS satellite wave form on existing Falcon III 117Gs, which triggered initial fielding of MUOS capability.
Also in the quarter, the Army contracted Harris to develop the narrowband mode for the Soldier Radio Waveform or SRW, a requirement for all Army modernization radios, the Manpack, the Rifleman, the MNVR and the future SANR or Small Airborne Networking Radio. This contract demonstrates Harris' leadership and expertise in adapting complex waveforms to meet the changing requirements of the Army's tactical network.
In legacy international, revenue trended favorably against our full year guidance and was higher in Europe, Central and Latin America or CALA and Asia Pacific, but was offset, as anticipated, by lower revenue in Central Asia and the Middle East Africa regions.
You'll recall that Europe was strong in fiscal '16, driven primarily by Eastern European countries, and that trend continued in Q1 with encouraging signs for the balance of the year. The CALA region is benefiting from the country's modernization of next-gen radios and a new $90 million contract win from U.S. Southern command supporting counter narcotics missions in Latin America. And in Asia Pac, we're supplying HF and multiband radio to support maritime capability in the Southeast Asian country as part of an ongoing trend of the U.S. bolstering partner capabilities in the region and a significant opportunity remains on the horizon in Australia. So overall, regional trends of strength and headwinds attracting about as we laid out in our 3Q and 4Q earnings calls and while still early in the year, represents a good start towards achieving our full year guidance. 
Turning to Space and Intel. We've another quarter of excellent wins from customers in the intelligence community, which continues to be a solid growth area for the company. In the quarter, Harris won a $25 million initial contract to develop a multimission small satellite for a classified customer, our second government win in this area. SmallSats are emerging as a low cost solution to a rapidly changing threat environment, offering a shorter development cycle and launched at a fraction of the cost and lead time of a large exclusive satellite. Our offering in this growing niche is powerful, combining a portfolio of advanced sensors, software-defined radio technology to support onboard mission changes and Harris' agility to quickly innovate as threats evolve.
We also continue to build on our franchise in Space Superiority. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was selected for $53 million in follow-on work to provide counter communication capabilities that detect adversary interference and take action to protect our space assets. This new win will bring contracts to date for this mission to about $200 million.
And then outside the intelligence community, we received a $90 million follow-on contract to provide navigation payloads for GPS Space -- III Space Vehicles 9 and 10. We're already under contract to deliver payloads for SV 1 through 8 and we're investing to develop a fully digital solution for 11 through 32. 
Turning to Electronic Systems. Q1 marked the third consecutive quarter of strong bookings for electronic warfare, winning modernizations on legacy platforms where we have strong incumbency positions. And as the EW capability gap between the U.S. and peer countries has narrowed, modernizations on deployed fleets have become a higher priority. We've included a $22 million contract for the B-1B and a 3-year $55 million contract to redesign the electronic warfare system for the B-52. B-52 wins over last 2 years now stand at about $200 million, and we continue to see strong future opportunities on fleets with long modernization tails.
In Critical Networks, Harris expanded its reach into a new market by leveraging a strong and long successful history with the FAA for designing and maintaining highly secure communication networks.
Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a 14-year $700 million ceiling IDIQ from the state of Florida to provide a statewide secure communications network.

Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and supplements GAAP results in our other quarterly earnings materials.Turning now to segment details on Slide 4. Communication Systems segment re",590,"Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and supplements GAAP results in our other quarterly earnings materials.
Turning now to segment details on Slide 4. Communication Systems segment revenue was $431 million and down 5% compared to the prior year. Tactical Communications was down 6%, primarily as a result of lower international SINCGARS sales. Public Safety was down 1%. Operating income was $119 million compared with $138 million in the prior year, driven by lower volume and mix.
On Slide 10, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical, orders, revenue and backlog.
Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 5. Revenue was $453 million and up 4% compared to prior year. This was driven by higher revenue from intelligence community customers and from Radiation Budget Instrument program called RBI to provide sensors for monitoring climate change and global warming on NASA's Joint Polar Satellite System. Operating income was $80 million compared with $68 million in the prior year, driven by continued strong program performance and higher pension income.
Electronic Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $361 million and up 2% on an organic basis compared to prior year, excluding $90 million of revenue from Aerostructures business that was divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal '16.
Higher revenue from initial ramp of recently awarded integrated Battle Management Systems in Middle East and from electronic warfare solutions was partially offset by lower wireless product sales. Operating income was $74 million compared with $69 million in the prior year. In addition to the electronic warfare contract that Bill mentioned, Harris received $35 million in follow-on contract for the F-35 program.
Critical Networks on Slide 7. Revenue was $527 million and down 7% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization program was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services down $30 million and in CapRock's commercial business down $25 million. IT Services revenue was in line with expectations of it stabilizing in the $225 million to $250 million per quarter range. And CapRock Commercial is now at approximately $75 million per quarter. Operating income was $66 million compared with $63 million in the prior year.
On top of what was already mentioned, Harris was awarded a 5-year $125 million, single award IDIQ for IT Services from a classified customer. This extends a 25-year relationship and reflects a business development focus in the intelligence community.
Moving to Slides 8 and 9. Fiscal '17 guidance remains unchanged with GAAP EPS guidance in a range of $1.553 to $1.573 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.570 to $1.590. As previously communicated, EPS guidance reflects $150 million in share repurchases for the year.
Total company revenue guidance is unchanged in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding revenue from Aerostructures divestiture. Outlook for segment and other details outlined in the slide also remain unchanged, including generating an expected $800 million in free cash flow for the full year.
Although the first quarter tax rate was 27.5%, we still expect a full year tax rate of 31%. Our expected 31% rate reflected adoption of a new accounting standard with stock compensation and the benefit of it primarily in the first quarter. The remaining 3 quarters are expected to average 32% weighting quarter-to-quarter depending on specific tax timing differences. We will update fiscal '17 guidance once CapRock transaction closes.
Now I'll just hand back to Bill for a few closing comments."

Saudi continues at a relatively low level, '16 came down from '15, but we don't see a big step down in '17. Right now it's running at a relatively low level as we see it. There's some pressure in Iraq just because of the strike in the country, but the opportunity we see on the horizon in Iraq are very, very sizable.

So we feel very good about the progress there and our position on that particular opportunity. On the Manpack, it continues to progress. We are one of 3 awardees, a very sizable contract. We completed the qualification tests. The customer testing should happen early in fiscal '17, so in the next 3 or 4 months. And then it will go into a delivery order procurement we'll be, might made by -- decision would be made by August, I believe, of next year with deliveries off of that starting about a year from now and then continuing into early calendar '18. So that has not moved out in terms of the delivery time frame on the back end. On the other one, which was -- which is important is Rifleman. We're one of 2 vendors, us and Thales, and you recall it's a $3.9 billion IDIQ. We've gotten through a qual test and customer test. It was for a single channel radio, but if you recall, they left a big part of the overall award value with an opportunity for a 2-channel radio, and it does sound like the Army is looking to perhaps accelerate the purchase of a 2-channel radio. They saw the opportunity with the radio we have with SOCOM, which is a single vendor award that we have as Harris Corporation. They saw the radio. There's a possibility they will accelerate the purchase of a 2-channel radio, which I think would be relatively good news for Harris since we're well positioned on that particular opportunity. And you saw in Q1 or as I mentioned in Q1 that we got a milestone sea approval on the mid-tier radio with half of the opportunity recognized in Q1. The other half will come sometime later in our fiscal '17. So overall, I think good progress. MUOS, we're very pleased with receiving NSA cert and to see initial fielding of that capability. Keep in mind, there's 30,000, 117Gs in the field that have the possibility of being upgraded with the MUOS waveform. And as that happens, since the development is all behind us and it's a software load, it comes down to us at a relatively high margin. So all of which I think is good progress in the quarter, Gautam. The last one I would mention is on SOCOM, I think it's a very important one. That's a 2-channel radio and that continues to progress. We're investing in it and we still see that on track for deliveries about a year from now."

Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal '17 with a good start out of the gate, and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're delivering on them. As part",1257,"Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal '17 with a good start out of the gate, and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're delivering on them. As part of an ongoing initiative to optimize our business portfolio, we announced earlier this morning a definitive agreement to sell the CapRock Commercial business for $425 million and plan to use the proceeds to pay down debt and repurchase shares. Portfolio shaping supports our strategy to invest in businesses where Harris can provide technology differentiation. And we'll continue to review our portfolio and objectively assess which businesses are a strategic fit and which businesses have better value under a different ownership structure.
We also remain committed to smart and balanced capital deployment, and in the first quarter, we used $100 million in cash to repurchase shares and we increased the dividend 6%, our 15th consecutive annual increase. We also repaid $33 million in term debt, and in early October we retired a $250 million bond that was due, making further progress towards our 3-year debt reduction goal of $2 billion, and we're about halfway there.
We remain laser focused on Exelis' integration and capturing synergies and related accretion, and through Q1, we're tracking well towards capturing $50 million of additional in-year saving, and achieving our target of $140 million to $150 million in run rate savings as we exit fiscal '17. And while all integration projects are complete or well underway, we'll continue to find ways to lower cost and drive productivity as part of our normal operational excellence agenda.
And then finally, investing in R&D and new product development to grow core franchises and expanding the close adjacencies has been an important part of our strategy. And in the first quarter, R&D spending was up 7% and over 4% of revenue. For the year, we still expect to spend about 4% of revenue, similar to fiscal '16 and at a level well above our peers.
So turning now to Q1 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.39, up 6% on a 2% organic revenue decline. Despite the revenue headwind and higher R&D spending in the quarter, operating margin increased 50 basis points as a result of higher synergies, productivity savings and pension income. Earnings per share also benefited from a lower tax rate in the first quarter.
Revenue reflected continued growth in Space and Intel, up 4%, and Electronic Systems up 2%, while Communications Systems was down 5% and Critical Networks was down 7%.
Orders were particularly strong with total company book-to-bill of 1.17 and funded backlog of 6% over the prior quarter. Book-to-bill for each segment was above 1, and within Communications Systems, we saw a strong recovery in our legacy tactical business where book-to-bill was 1.22. Healthy bookings plus several opportunities that slipped from the back half of fiscal '16 drew our backlog up 16% sequentially to $467 million and higher in both DoD and international.
Q1 revenue in legacy tactical was also encouraging at down 1% with DoD revenue up 4% and international down 4%. Within DoD, higher first quarter revenue was primarily related to achieving important milestones early in the year for MNVR and MUOS. We received a limited rate production authorization on MNVR, which is our mid-tier networking radio; and formal NSA certification for running the MUOS satellite wave form on existing Falcon III 117Gs, which triggered initial fielding of MUOS capability.
Also in the quarter, the Army contracted Harris to develop the narrowband mode for the Soldier Radio Waveform or SRW, a requirement for all Army modernization radios, the Manpack, the Rifleman, the MNVR and the future SANR or Small Airborne Networking Radio. This contract demonstrates Harris' leadership and expertise in adapting complex waveforms to meet the changing requirements of the Army's tactical network.
In legacy international, revenue trended favorably against our full year guidance and was higher in Europe, Central and Latin America or CALA and Asia Pacific, but was offset, as anticipated, by lower revenue in Central Asia and the Middle East Africa regions.
You'll recall that Europe was strong in fiscal '16, driven primarily by Eastern European countries, and that trend continued in Q1 with encouraging signs for the balance of the year. The CALA region is benefiting from the country's modernization of next-gen radios and a new $90 million contract win from U.S. Southern command supporting counter narcotics missions in Latin America. And in Asia Pac, we're supplying HF and multiband radio to support maritime capability in the Southeast Asian country as part of an ongoing trend of the U.S. bolstering partner capabilities in the region and a significant opportunity remains on the horizon in Australia. So overall, regional trends of strength and headwinds attracting about as we laid out in our 3Q and 4Q earnings calls and while still early in the year, represents a good start towards achieving our full year guidance. 
Turning to Space and Intel. We've another quarter of excellent wins from customers in the intelligence community, which continues to be a solid growth area for the company. In the quarter, Harris won a $25 million initial contract to develop a multimission small satellite for a classified customer, our second government win in this area. SmallSats are emerging as a low cost solution to a rapidly changing threat environment, offering a shorter development cycle and launched at a fraction of the cost and lead time of a large exclusive satellite. Our offering in this growing niche is powerful, combining a portfolio of advanced sensors, software-defined radio technology to support onboard mission changes and Harris' agility to quickly innovate as threats evolve.
We also continue to build on our franchise in Space Superiority. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was selected for $53 million in follow-on work to provide counter communication capabilities that detect adversary interference and take action to protect our space assets. This new win will bring contracts to date for this mission to about $200 million.
And then outside the intelligence community, we received a $90 million follow-on contract to provide navigation payloads for GPS Space -- III Space Vehicles 9 and 10. We're already under contract to deliver payloads for SV 1 through 8 and we're investing to develop a fully digital solution for 11 through 32. 
Turning to Electronic Systems. Q1 marked the third consecutive quarter of strong bookings for electronic warfare, winning modernizations on legacy platforms where we have strong incumbency positions. And as the EW capability gap between the U.S. and peer countries has narrowed, modernizations on deployed fleets have become a higher priority. We've included a $22 million contract for the B-1B and a 3-year $55 million contract to redesign the electronic warfare system for the B-52. B-52 wins over last 2 years now stand at about $200 million, and we continue to see strong future opportunities on fleets with long modernization tails.
In Critical Networks, Harris expanded its reach into a new market by leveraging a strong and long successful history with the FAA for designing and maintaining highly secure communication networks.
Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a 14-year $700 million ceiling IDIQ from the state of Florida to provide a statewide secure communications network. This network called MyFloridaNet-2 will have about 4,000 sites connecting public safety, law enforcement and other state and local government agencies.
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Rahul for more financial detail and guidance. Rahul?"

Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and supplements GAAP results in our other quarterly earnings materials.Turning now to segment details on Slide 4. Communication Systems segment re",590,"Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and supplements GAAP results in our other quarterly earnings materials.
Turning now to segment details on Slide 4. Communication Systems segment revenue was $431 million and down 5% compared to the prior year. Tactical Communications was down 6%, primarily as a result of lower international SINCGARS sales. Public Safety was down 1%. Operating income was $119 million compared with $138 million in the prior year, driven by lower volume and mix.
On Slide 10, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical, orders, revenue and backlog.
Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 5. Revenue was $453 million and up 4% compared to prior year. This was driven by higher revenue from intelligence community customers and from Radiation Budget Instrument program called RBI to provide sensors for monitoring climate change and global warming on NASA's Joint Polar Satellite System. Operating income was $80 million compared with $68 million in the prior year, driven by continued strong program performance and higher pension income.
Electronic Systems on Slide 6. Revenue was $361 million and up 2% on an organic basis compared to prior year, excluding $90 million of revenue from Aerostructures business that was divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal '16.
Higher revenue from initial ramp of recently awarded integrated Battle Management Systems in Middle East and from electronic warfare solutions was partially offset by lower wireless product sales. Operating income was $74 million compared with $69 million in the prior year. In addition to the electronic warfare contract that Bill mentioned, Harris received $35 million in follow-on contract for the F-35 program.
Critical Networks on Slide 7. Revenue was $527 million and down 7% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization program was more than offset by lower revenue in IT Services down $30 million and in CapRock's commercial business down $25 million. IT Services revenue was in line with expectations of it stabilizing in the $225 million to $250 million per quarter range. And CapRock Commercial is now at approximately $75 million per quarter. Operating income was $66 million compared with $63 million in the prior year.
On top of what was already mentioned, Harris was awarded a 5-year $125 million, single award IDIQ for IT Services from a classified customer. This extends a 25-year relationship and reflects a business development focus in the intelligence community.
Moving to Slides 8 and 9. Fiscal '17 guidance remains unchanged with GAAP EPS guidance in a range of $1.553 to $1.573 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.570 to $1.590. As previously communicated, EPS guidance reflects $150 million in share repurchases for the year.
Total company revenue guidance is unchanged in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding revenue from Aerostructures divestiture. Outlook for segment and other details outlined in the slide also remain unchanged, including generating an expected $800 million in free cash flow for the full year.
Although the first quarter tax rate was 27.5%, we still expect a full year tax rate of 31%. Our expected 31% rate reflected adoption of a new accounting standard with stock compensation and the benefit of it primarily in the first quarter. The remaining 3 quarters are expected to average 32% weighting quarter-to-quarter depending on specific tax timing differences. We will update fiscal '17 guidance once CapRock transaction closes.
Now I'll just hand back to Bill for a few closing comments."

I mean, it's still a big opportunity on the horizon and it's on the order in total about $600 million, a little less than that, but they decided to split it into 2 pieces, as I mentioned on the last call, and we still expect about half a book towards the back end of our fiscal year, the other sometime into '18 or beyond. So we feel very good about the progress there and our position on that particular opportunity. On the Manpack, it continues to progress. We are one of 3 awardees, a very sizable contract. We completed the qualification tests. The customer testing should happen early in fiscal '17, so in the next 3 or 4 months. And then it will go into a delivery order procurement we'll be, might made by -- decision would be made by August, I believe, of next year with deliveries off of that starting about a year from now and then continuing into early calendar '18. So that has not moved out in terms of the delivery time frame on the back end. On the other one, which was -- which is important is Rifleman. We're one of 2 vendors, us and Thales, and you recall it's a $3.9 billion IDIQ. We've gotten through a qual test and customer test. It was for a single channel radio, but if you recall, they left a big part of the overall award value with an opportunity for a 2-channel radio, and it does sound like the Army is looking to perhaps accelerate the purchase of a 2-channel radio. They saw the opportunity with the radio we have with SOCOM, which is a single vendor award that we have as Harris Corporation. They saw the radio. There's a possibility they will accelerate the purchase of a 2-channel radio, which I think would be relatively good news for Harris since we're well positioned on that particular opportunity. And you saw in Q1 or as I mentioned in Q1 that we got a milestone sea approval on the mid-tier radio with half of the opportunity recognized in Q1. The other half will come sometime later in our fiscal '17. So overall, I think good progress. MUOS, we're very pleased with receiving NSA cert and to see initial fielding of that capability. Keep in mind, there's 30,000, 117Gs in the field that have the possibility of being upgraded with the MUOS waveform. And as that happens, since the development is all behind us and it's a software load, it comes down to us at a relatively high margin. So all of which I think is good progress in the quarter, Gautam. The last one I would mention is on SOCOM, I think it's a very important one. That's a 2-channel radio and that continues to progress. We're investing in it and we still see that on track for deliveries about a year from now."
